According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, under B@G-LTD-1 (effective from 8/1/2004), a term used is the "Total Disability Benefit Period." This period, initially set at two years, may be extended up to five additional years if the disability continues. The policy also specifies that the total disability benefit amounts to 60% of the pre-disability monthly earnings, subject to a maximum and minimum limit. Notably, this policy revision took place on 8/1/2004.
<EOS>
This Unum long-term disability plan offers financial protection, providing a portion of your pre-disability income during periods of disability. The amount you receive is contingent on your earnings prior to the onset of disability. In select cases, you may still receive payments even while working part-time or reduced hours. The plan details are found in Unum Cert 4507483.pdf pages [5] rows [5, 6, 7].
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, the effective date of this policy is August 1, 2001. The policy outlines that the disability benefits start after a 90-day elimination period, and 60% of monthly earnings are payable during the first 24 months, then 50% thereafter, up to a maximum monthly benefit of $7,500. The policy also includes an option for residual benefits, which pays if the insured's disability reduces their ability to perform the substantial and material duties of their own occupation by at least 20%. Furthermore, this policy has a cost-of-living adjustment provision that increases benefits annually based on the Consumer Price Index.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, policy number 561007 specifies the disability income benefit percentage as 60%. This long-term disability insurance covers own occupation, with a maximum benefit of $7,000 per month. The elimination period is 90 days, and benefits will be paid until age 65 or the end of the policy term (whichever comes first). The benefit amount decreases by 1% each month after age 60, with the reduction starting at 48 months following the onset date. The disability must prevent you from performing the material and substantial duties of your regular occupation to qualify for benefits.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4507483.pdf (page 5, row 18), eligible groups include doctors actively employed in the United States by the employer. This policy applies to medical professionals currently working for the specified entity in the United States. Active employment status is a key requirement for coverage under this insurance policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on page 5, row 22, eligible employees must work a minimum of 20 hours per week to qualify for benefits under this policy. This requirement applies to all participating employees. The weekly hours can vary but should not fall below the specified threshold. This condition is essential in determining eligibility for coverage under this insurance plan.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, the waiting period for disability benefits depends on the employee's enrollment date: For employees who were part of an eligible group before August 1, 2001, there is no specified waiting period. However, for those joining an eligible group after August 1, 2001, the waiting period is either the first of the month coinciding with or following 90 days of continuous active employment.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 5, rows 33-34, if your employment ends and you are rehired within a year, the time spent in an eligible group prior to the termination counts towards meeting the waiting period for policy benefits. All other policy provisions remain applicable.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, if you have been consistently employed for a duration equivalent to your waiting period, Unum will waive the waiting period when you enroll in an eligible group. This waiver is applicable only if you meet the employment duration requirement beforehand. The waiting period waiver does not apply retroactively and coverage will commence from the effective date of your group eligibility. Please refer to specific policy details for the exact waiting period duration, as it may vary based on your employment history with your current employer.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 5, rows 43 and 44, any previous employment period with your employer will be factored into determining your eligibility date's waiting period. This means that prior work history may potentially expedite the waiting period before benefits are activated. It's essential to note that only work experience with the stated employer is considered in this process.
<EOS>
Under the Unum Cert 4507483 insurance policy, you are responsible for paying the coverage cost. The premium amount is based on factors such as age, health status, and chosen benefit level. Premiums may be paid monthly, quarterly, or annually, with options for auto-debit or mail payments. Any premium adjustments will take effect upon receipt of your notification by the policy anniversary date. This document also states that failure to pay premiums could result in policy termination.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, on page 5 rows 52 and 54, the elimination period for benefits is 90 days. Once this period has elapsed, you will receive your disability benefits, starting from the day after the completion of the elimination period. This means that if you are eligible for these benefits, you must wait for a total of 91 days (including the elimination period) before receiving any payment. It's essential to note that the elimination period is only applicable to the disability benefits outlined in this policy document.
<EOS>
Under the Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, your monthly disability benefit is set at 60% of your earnings, with a maximum limit of $10,000. This payment may be adjusted based on deductible income sources and any disability earnings you might have. However, certain disabilities might not be covered or may have limited coverage under this policy as specified in B@G-LTD-2 (8/1/2004) REV. It is crucial to note that some disabilities may not be fully covered or may even be excluded from this plan.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, the maximum duration of payments varies based on age at disability. If you become disabled before age 62, payments will continue until age 67. For ages 62-69, the payment period decreases incrementally: 60 months for age 62, 48 months for age 63, 42 months for age 64, 36 months for age 65, 30 months for age 66, 24 months for age 67, 18 months for age 68, and 12 months for ages 69 and over. Notably, there are no premium payments required during the duration of this plan while you're receiving benefits.
<EOS>
This Unum policy offers a Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance benefit, detailed on pages 6 (rows 28-34). If you become disabled, 10% of your monthly disability payment, up to $1,000, will be allocated during your participation in this program. For three months following the end of your disability, should we deem you no longer disabled and unable to find employment, additional monthly payments will be made. This support is only provided while you are actively participating in the rehabilitation program.
<EOS>
Under Unum's Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program outlined in section 4507483.pdf (page 6, rows 38-45), participants may receive monthly dependent care expense payments. The dependent care expense benefit amount is $350 per month for each eligible dependent, with a combined maximum of $1,000 per month for all such expenses. This assistance aims to help cover eligible dependent care costs while you participate in the program.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, the total monthly benefit received from this policy, including all benefits provided, will not surpass 100% of your earnings (excluding rehabilitation assistance). If you participate in Unum's Rehabilitation and Return to Work program, the total benefit will be capped at 110% of your monthly earnings. These limits apply across the entirety of this plan.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483, page 6 row 59, a pre-existing condition is recognized within the first 12 months of coverage, with benefits payable at 3/12 after the qualifying waiting period. This means that if a claim related to a pre-existing condition is made within the initial 12 months, benefits will be paid starting from the third month following the effective date of coverage, subject to other policy terms and conditions.
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 4507483.pdf (8/1/2004) REV details the Work Life Assistance Program on pages 6 and 7. Under this program, eligible employees receive short-term disability benefits in case of illness or injury. The benefit amount is 60% of weekly earnings, with a maximum weekly benefit of $1,500 for up to 26 weeks. It's essential to review the full certificate of coverage for comprehensive understanding of your coverage.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, you should notify us of your claim as soon as possible and within 30 days after your disability starts. Proof of your claim must be sent no later than 90 days post-elimination period; if not possible within 90 days, it must be provided no later than a year from the proof's usual requirement date (except in cases of legal incapacity). The claim form can be obtained from your employer or requested directly from us. If you don't receive the form within 15 days of requesting, submit written proof without delay. Inform us immediately if you return to work in any capacity.
<EOS>
To file a claim under the policy outlined in Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, both you and your employer are required to fill out respective sections of the claim form. Upon completion, the filled form should be provided to your attending physician who will then proceed to complete their section and send it directly to Unum without delay for processing.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, your disability claim requires evidence of regular physician care, monthly income documentation, the onset date and cause of disability, descriptions of disability restrictions and limitations affecting your occupation, plus hospital or institution treatment details, including attending physicians. You may be requested to provide proof of ongoing disability within 45 days following a request. Additional medical and non-medical information might be required for claim verification, with Unum potentially denying or suspending payments if vital information is absent.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 7 and 8, row numbers 1 and 2, the insurer will make LTD (Long Term Disability) payments directly to you under policy LTD-CLM-2 (8/1/2004 REV). These payments are subject to the policy's terms and conditions. The payments are designed to replace a percentage of your pre-disability earnings, as specified in the policy, should you become unable to work due to a covered disability.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, the policyholder is required to reimburse any overpayments resulting from fraud, errors in claim processing, or receipt of deductible income sources. Repayment methods will be determined by Unum, and they will not recover more than the amount overpaid. It is essential to note that Unum has the right to demand full repayment. This information can be found on page 8, rows [1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10].
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 9, rows 1-2, 4-6, this certificate outlines key details of your coverage, including: who is eligible for benefits, the limitations and exclusions within the plan that may apply, and the recipients to whom Unum will make payments. It's essential to understand these points, as they impact your entitlement to the specified coverage outlined in this document.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, eligibility for coverage is contingent upon employment within an eligible group. The effective date of your coverage is either the plan's initiation date or the day after completion of the waiting period.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, coverage begins as follows: If your employer fully covers the policy under a plan, you're covered from 12:01 a.m. on the date of eligibility. If costs are shared or self-paid, coverage commences at 12:01 a.m. either on the eligibility date if applied for by that time, within 31 days after eligibility, or when Unum approves your application (if evidence of insurability is required due to late application or voluntary cancellation). Evidence of insurability can be obtained from your employer. If applying beyond 31 days or reapplying after canceling, evidence of insurability is mandated.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 9, rows 1 and 2, your coverage will commence upon your return to active employment following an absence due to injury, sickness, temporary layoff, or leave of absence. This policy does not provide coverage during the time you are absent from work.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, if your employment temporarily ceases (layoff), coverage under the policy will continue until the end of the month succeeding the one in which your layoff begins, provided that premium payments are maintained. This applies only during the temporary layoff phase and does not extend to subsequent periods of unemployment or absence from work. The specific dates relevant to this coverage depend on when your employment termination occurs.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on page 10, row numbers 1-3, if an employee goes on leave of absence and premiums are paid, the coverage will continue through the month directly following the one in which their leave commences.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, any additional or increased coverage commences immediately for those in active employment or on a covered leave or layoff. If you're absent due to injury or illness, the enhanced coverage starts upon your return to work. Decreased coverage takes effect immediately as well but won't affect claims already being paid. However, changes in coverage do not impact payable claims that occurred before the decrease.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, your policy or plan coverage ends on the earliest of:

1. The date of cancellation.
2. If you are no longer part of an eligible group.
3. If your eligible group is terminated from coverage.
4. The last day of the period for which required contributions were made.
5. The last day of active employment, unless specified under the covered layoff or leave of absence provision.

Additionally, Unum provides coverage for a payable claim during the policy or plan coverage period.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, legal action on your claim can be initiated between 60 days following the submission of proof of claim and up to 3 years from when the proof of claim is required (unless otherwise stipulated under federal law). This timeframe applies to this specific policy.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, any statements made in a signed application for coverage are considered representations, not warranties. Incomplete or untrue statements can lead to claim reductions, denials, or policy cancellations from the original effective date. The insurance company will base its decisions on the statements provided in the signed application. If the employer provides incorrect information about you, they will use these facts to decide your coverage and make a fair premium adjustment.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, insurance fraud is prohibited as it may incur unnecessary costs for you and your employer. The policy vows to employ all necessary means for detecting, investigating, and prosecuting such acts. Knowingly providing false, incomplete, or misleading information to Unum, or submitting materially false claims, is considered a crime and will result in claim denial, and could lead to legal prosecution and punishment under state and/or federal law. If insurance fraud occurs, Unum will pursue appropriate legal remedies.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, this policy does not supersede any obligations for workers' compensation or state disability insurance coverage. In other words, the policy does not replace these mandatory coverages.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, your employer acts on its behalf or as your agent under this policy. Your employer will never be considered an agent of Unum. This clarification was updated in LTD-BEN-1 on August 1st, 2004 (Revision 10).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, disability is defined as a condition where an individual cannot perform the material and substantial duties of their regular occupation due to sickness or injury, and there is a minimum 20% loss in indexed monthly earnings because of the same health issue. To be considered disabled, one must be under the regular care of a physician. Unum reserves the right to have you examined by chosen physicians, medical practitioners, and vocational experts at their expense. These examinations may occur as often as necessary, and interviews with authorized Unum representatives are also possible. The loss of a professional or occupational license or certification does not automatically mean disability under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on page 17 rows [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28], benefits under items 1, 2, and 3 in the deductible sources of income section may be reduced if they have not been awarded, denied, or are being appealed. However, no reduction will occur if you apply for these disability payments, appeal your denial to all administrative levels Unum deems necessary, and sign their payment option form. Overpayments due to an award will be adjusted upon receiving proof of the amount or when all required appeals are completed. If a lump sum is received from any deductible sources, it will be distributed monthly over a specified or reasonable time period.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, if you are disabled and working concurrently, the days you are incapacitated will be factored into your elimination period for Long-Term Disability benefits (LTD-BEN). This means that your disability days are considered while determining whether you can meet the elimination period stipulation, as per the update on August 1, 2004 (revision 11).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf (page 13, rows 1-3), payments will commence once your claim is approved, contingent on the elimination period being fulfilled and if you are deemed disabled. You will receive a monthly payment for any duration that Unum is financially responsible. The elimination period could vary depending on the specific policy details, such as the option selected between short-term (14 or 26 weeks) or long-term (52 weeks).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483, page 13 row 1, the payment amount for disability is determined through a process that considers your Pre-Disability Earnings (PDE). Your PDE is typically the average of the total earnings from all covered employment in the base period. The base period is the first 52 weeks prior to the start of your Disability Benefit Period (DBP) or the actual employment during such period, whichever is longer. The benefit percentage is generally 60% of your PDE up to a maximum monthly amount, subject to cost-of-living adjustments. Your DBP may last up to 24 months initially, with extensions up to 5 years if you remain totally disabled after the initial period.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, the lesser of the two amounts determined in Item 1 (your Monthly Earnings) and the maximum monthly benefit is your gross disability payment. The maximum monthly benefit varies based on your occupation and earnings at time of policy issue. The specified waiting period for disability benefits is 180 days. Additionally, the policy provides a Residual Disability Benefit that pays a percentage of your pre-disability earnings if you return to work but earn less due to your disability. The Residual Benefit amount is determined by comparing your post-disability earnings with your pre-disability earnings.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, on page 13 row 9, your monthly disability payment (Item 4) is the amount determined under this policy. It's essential to note that any deductible sources of income should be subtracted from this payment. The specific deductible sources are not explicitly stated in this document, but they likely include income received from other sources during the period of disability, as per common practices in such policies. Consult with your policy or contact Unum for further clarification if necessary.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf (page 13, rows 1-5), the total benefit payable monthly under this policy, inclusive of all benefits, will not surpass 100% of your earnings. However, if you're enrolled in Unum's Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program, the monthly benefit can extend up to 110% of your earnings. These percentages apply to your regular salary.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 13, rows 1-6, the term "Monthly Earnings" refers to your pre-tax gross income from your employer prior to disability. This total includes all income but excludes commissions, bonuses, overtime pay, and any other additional compensation, as well as income sourced outside of your employer. Deductions made for qualified deferred compensation plans, Section 125 plans, or flexible spending accounts are also not included in this calculation.
<EOS>
During a covered layoff or leave of absence as detailed in Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 13 rows 1-3, if you become disabled, your monthly earnings from the employer effective just prior to the start of your absence will be used for disability benefits determination. The policy employs these earnings to ascertain your pre-disability income level, which determines the amount of benefits provided during your disability period. This approach ensures continuity of benefits in circumstances where an individual's earning potential has been impacted due to a covered layoff or leave of absence.
<EOS>
This information from Unum Cert 4507483.pdf outlines disability benefit payments when monthly earnings are less than 20% of indexed earnings due to a sickness or injury, with payments sent regardless of work status. If disability earnings range from 20% to 80% of indexed earnings, the payment is calculated based on LTD-BEN-3 (8/1/2004) REV 12, and during the first 12 months of payments while working, no reduction occurs as long as disability earnings plus gross disability payment do not surpass 100% of indexed monthly earnings. This structure remains in effect for the same sickness or injury.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, if the answer from Item 1 does not exceed or equal 100% of your indexed monthly earnings, your monthly payment will remain unchanged. However, if it surpasses this threshold, a deduction will be made for the amount over 100%. After 12 months of payments while working, you will start receiving payments proportionate to the disability-induced income loss percentage.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf (page 14, row 19), your monthly benefits under this policy are calculated by dividing the percentage of lost earnings specified in Item 1 by your indexed monthly earnings. This percentage represents a portion of your pre-disability income. The benefits are payable during the benefit period stated in your certificate, which may extend up to age 65 or 67 depending on the specifics of your case.
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 4507483 policy detail outlines the monthly payment amount you'll receive upon disability. You may need to provide quarterly proof of your disability earnings, and Unum reserves the right to adjust your payment accordingly. Relevant financial records could be requested for verification. After the elimination period, if disabled for less than a month, expect a 1/30th fraction of your monthly payment per day.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 14, rows 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10, if your disability earnings fluctuate significantly from month to month, the company may average your earnings over the past three months to decide whether your claim should continue. Your claim will not be terminated unless the averaged disability earnings from the last three months exceeds 80% of indexed monthly earnings. During any month that your disability earnings are more than 80% of indexed monthly earnings, Unum will not pay you benefits.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 14 and 15, row numbers 1, 2, 2, and 3, Unum will reduce your gross disability payment by deducting income from the LTD-BEN-4 policy (effective since August 1, 2004, revision 13). This means that any income earned under this specific policy will be subtracted from your total disability benefit.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 15, rows 3-5, the benefits you may receive from this policy are based on a workers' compensation law, an occupational disease law, or any other act/law with similar intent. The amount you receive is determined by these laws' provisions, which can include total or partial disability payments and death benefits. The duration of these benefits varies according to the specific law in question. Any adjustments to your benefit amount are subject to cost-of-living increases unless otherwise specified. Additionally, any back pay owed will be paid within 30 days of the date of determination, while future benefits will commence as soon as they become payable under the law.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 15, rows 8-13, the disability income you receive or are eligible for excludes benefits from state compulsory acts or laws, automobile liability insurance policies, other group insurance plans, and governmental retirement systems related to your employment. Specifically, it means that any income derived from these sources will not affect your disability payments under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, disability payments you, your spouse, or children might receive could stem from multiple sources. These include the United States Social Security Act, Canada Pension Plan, Quebec Pension Plan, and any similar plans or acts. It is crucial to note that these benefits may impact the amount of disability payments you are eligible for under this policy. The specific amount depends on various factors including your earnings before disability, the duration of disability, and the applicable plan's benefit structure.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 15 and specific rows 24-30, your retirement payments may affect the benefits received by your dependents, such as children or a spouse, if you receive them under:

* The United States Social Security Act
* The Canada Pension Plan
* The Quebec Pension Plan
* Any similar plan or act.

This applies to any dependent who is receiving payments from these plans due to your retirement benefits. It's essential to understand that these dependents' payments could be impacted if you are receiving such retirement benefits yourself.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, disability payments under your employer's retirement plan are considered either due to disability or upon reaching age 62 or the defined normal retirement age. These payments are based on your employer's contributions and do not affect the retirement benefit that would have been paid in the absence of disability. Any reduction in future disability benefits under the plan is also regarded as a retirement benefit. Unum will consider both your and your employer's contributions to be distributed concurrently throughout your lifetime. Retirement funds not rolled over or transferred to an eligible retirement plan, as defined by Section 402 of the Internal Revenue Code including any future LTD-BEN-5 amendments, are not included.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, under Section 6, benefits received are subject to the Jones Act (Title 46, United States Code Section 688). This means that the total amount you receive is reduced by a certain percentage that corresponds to your earnings before disability. The reduction begins on the first day of the disability and continues throughout its duration. The specific percentage depends on your pre-disability earnings, which should be reported accurately for proper calculation of benefits.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, your payment will be adjusted if you receive funds from a third party (judgment, settlement) due to the same disability. However, we will exclude retirement payments from reduction. The exception is made for Social Security retirement income if your disability starts after age 65 and you were already receiving such payments prior to disability. In all cases, only deductible sources of income arising from the same disability will be considered for reductions.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on page 16, several income sources are exempted from deductions when calculating gross disability payments. These include retirement plans such as 401(k), profit sharing, thrift, tax-sheltered annuities, stock ownership, non-qualified deferred compensation, pension plans for partners, military pensions and disability income, credit disability insurance, franchise disability income, retirement plans from another Employer, individual retirement accounts (IRA), individual disability income plans, salary continuation or accumulated sick leave plans.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4507483.pdf (page 16), the minimum monthly payment under the Minimum Benefit is either $100 or 10% of your gross disability payment. If there's an outstanding overpayment, Unum may apply this amount towards it.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 16 and 17, any deductible income sources that are subtracted from your long-term disability (LTD) payment will not further be reduced due to a cost of living increase from that source as per LTD-BEN-6 revised in 2004. The document emphasizes that once the reduction is made, the LTD payment will not be further decreased despite any subsequent cost of living adjustments stemming from that deductible income source.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 17 and 18, your Long-Term Disability (LTD) benefits payment duration depends on your age at disability. For instance, if you are under 62 years old, payments will continue until you reach 67. If you're 62, you'll receive payments for 60 months; if 63, 48 months; 64, 42 months; 65, 36 months; 66, 30 months; 67, 24 months; 68, 18 months; and over 69, payments last 12 months. If you are exactly 62 at the onset of disability, benefits will end 2 years and 6 months later. LTD-BEN-7 (8/1/2004) REV 16 governs these terms.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, payments will cease and your claim will end on the earliest of the following scenarios: if you are capable of working part-time in your regular occupation but decide not to, or if your monthly disability earnings exceed 80% of your indexed monthly earnings. This may also occur after the maximum payment period, if you no longer meet the plan's disability criteria (unless eligible for Unum's Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program), if you fail to cooperate or participate in this program, if you fail to submit proof of continuing disability, or if you reside outside the United States or Canada for 6 months or more during any consecutive 12 months of benefits. The payments will also stop upon your death.
<EOS>

<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, if your disability recurs within 6 months after the end of a prior claim and you were continuously insured under the plan during that interval, the recurrent disability will be considered an extension of the prior claim without requiring another elimination period. The terms of this policy will apply to both instances. However, any disability occurring more than 6 months following the end of the prior claim will be treated as a new claim, subject to all policy provisions. Additionally, if you are entitled to payments from any other group long term disability plan, you will not receive benefits under the Unum plan (LTD-OTR-1, 8/1/2004 REV 18).
