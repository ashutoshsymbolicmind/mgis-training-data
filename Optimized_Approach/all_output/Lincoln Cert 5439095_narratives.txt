The insurance policy document, Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, commences on January 1, 2021, superseding any earlier certificates from the same date. Coverage is contingent upon eligibility and compliance with the policy's terms. Effective dates are significant, particularly for an employee's initial coverage, which kicks in at 12:01 a.m. on the earliest of four possible scenarios: first Insurance Month after eligibility, resumption of Active Work, written application for coverage, or Company-approved Evidence of Insurability (if required). A different Eligible Class can be joined from the next Insurance Month following the change date. The Progressive Income Benefit becomes active either on the Long Term Disability Benefits effective date or upon amendment of the policy, unless delayed for an Insured Employee unable to perform Activities of Daily Living or suffering from a Cognitive Impairment on that date. This benefit does not cover any Disability beginning before the employee's coverage under this benefit, specifically Disabilities related to Pre-Existing Conditions (treatment within 3 months prior to Effective Date). An exception exists for employees who were not Actively-At-Work due to Injury or Sickness on the policy's Effective Date; their coverage is determined by the prior carrier's policy. Employees who were Actively-At-Work and insured under the Policy on the policy's Effective Date retain that coverage.

According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, the policy has no waiting period for eligibility. Employees working full-time (at least 30 hours per week) become eligible upon starting active full-time employment, with no requirement for prior service or providing evidence of insurability. Prior service credit towards the waiting period is applicable when a former employee is rehired within one year after leaving employment. The Waiting Period duration is detailed in the Schedule of Benefits, and this policy does not have a pre-existing condition limitation, exclusions, or prior carrier credit provisions. Employees are provided with a Certificate of Group Insurance containing details about the benefits, elimination period, maximum benefit period, own occupation period, and waiting period. The plan year ends on December 31st of each year. No Collective Bargaining Agreements or Trustee information were specified in this document section.

In the Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf document, it is noted that long-term disability coverage for insured employees does not require employee contributions. The contribution basis originates from the 'income box' on their W-2 form, encompassing pre-tax earnings before deductions, such as salaries and wages. Contributions are managed by the Plan Administrator who is responsible for maintaining records, depositing funds, and authorizing administrative expenses.

The percentage of disability benefits varies based on a Schedule of Benefits, which includes details like the benefit percentage (not specified), maximum and minimum monthly benefits, elimination period, maximum benefit period, own occupation period, and waiting period. Employees become eligible upon active full-time employment, with the eligibility date coinciding with or following their first month of employment.

The plan's fiscal year ends on December 31st each year, and there are no relevant collective bargaining agreements or specified Plan Trustees mentioned in this section. All employees receive a Certificate of Group Insurance detailing the benefits, pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, and prior carrier credit provisions, as well as the Schedule of Benefits containing essential information about the plan.

This information from Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf outlines key details of a long-term disability insurance policy. The Benefit Percentage is 60%, with the Maximum Monthly Benefit not surpassing this percentage multiplied by the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings. An Elimination Period of 90 days applies for Disability caused by a singular or related Sickness or Injury, accumulated within a 180-day period. The Maximum Benefit Period varies based on the Insured Employee's age and Social Security Normal Retirement Age, with a maximum of 12 months for employees over 69. The OWN Occupation Period starts at the end of the Elimination Period and ends at the Maximum Benefit Period, limited by the amount shown in the Employer's financial records or the Maximum Covered Monthly Earnings permitted by the Policy. A Partial Disability Monthly Benefit calculation excludes Basic Monthly Earnings exceeding the amount shown in the Employer's financial records. The Total Disability Monthly Benefit will not be less than the Minimum Monthly Benefit, but if combined with Other Income Benefits, it should not surpass 100% of the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings. Critical details like the Benefit Percentage, Maximum and Minimum Monthly Benefits, Elimination Period, Maximum Benefit Period, OWN Occupation Period, and Waiting Period are provided in the Schedule of Benefits included in each employee's Certificate of Group Insurance. Employees working at least 30 hours per week, with active full-time employment starting from the first of the month, are eligible for this policy.

The document titled Lincoln Cert 5439095 indicates that under this policy, benefits for a Total Disability due to a Pre-Existing Condition may be payable for an Employee who was insured by the prior carrier's policy at the time of transfer and was Actively-At-Work and insured under the Policy on the Policy's Effective Date (pages 3, 15). However, if the Insured Employee cannot satisfy the Policy's Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion, but can satisfy the prior carrier's pre-existing condition exclusion given consideration towards continuous time insured under both policies, then he or she will be paid according to the terms of the policy (pages 26, 27).

   The Policy has a Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion, and if the Insured Employee qualifies for benefits, they will be paid according to the Policy's benefit schedule (page 32). If an Insured Employee receives treatment within 3 months prior to the Effective Date for a Sickness or Injury that is considered a Pre-Existing Condition, then this condition will not be covered during the first 12 months following the Effective Date (pages 3, 15).

   Additionally, Diability due to a Pre-Existing Condition benefits may only be payable for up to two years from the Policy's Effective Date, after which time the condition must meet the requirements of a qualifying disability (page 32). It is essential to note that any diagnosis, treatment, or consultation related to the Pre-Existing Condition received within this 12-month period will not be covered under the policy during this timeframe (pages 26, 27).

   Lastly, treatment for a Pre-Existing Condition that does not meet the definition of a qualifying disability after the first two years may still be covered if it results in a complication or recurrence of the original condition and meets the requirements of a qualifying disability (page 32). The policy defines "Treatment" as consultation, care, or services provided by a Physician. It also includes diagnostic measures and the prescription, refill of prescription, or taking of any prescribed drugs or medicines (page 26, 27).

This insurance policy, Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, details a disability coverage plan with essential parameters outlined on specified pages. The maximum monthly benefit is capped at the benefit percentage multiplied by the basic monthly earnings. The elimination period for disability spans 90 days, accumulated within 180 days. The maximum benefit period varies based on the insured employee's age and ranges from 12 to 60 months for ages under 69, while those aged 69 and over receive a 12-month benefit. This coverage extends until the insured employee's Social Security Normal Retirement Age or the stated maximum benefit period.

The basic monthly earnings are calculated as one twelfth of the annual gross earnings from the employer during the tax year preceding the determination date, with limitations on the lesser amount shown in the employer's financial records, premium-paid amount, or the maximum covered monthly earnings permitted by the policy.

For an insured employee who did not receive a W-2 form before the determination date, the basic monthly earnings are determined by averaging the monthly gross earnings during the employment period as documented in the employer's financial records. The total covered payroll consists of the basic monthly earnings for all employees insured under the policy.

The total disability monthly benefit is calculated based on the insured employee's basic monthly earnings multiplied by the benefit percentage, with a minimum monthly benefit set in place. This benefit will not exceed the maximum monthly benefit for long-term disability benefits or $5,000 per month. The progressive income benefit will not be affected by other income benefits or earnings from any employment form.

This Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf document outlines the maximum benefit period for long-term disability insurance. The maximum benefit duration varies based on the insured employee's age and can extend up to 12 months for those aged 69 or above, or until their Social Security Normal Retirement Age, whichever comes first. The maximum benefit period for ages less than 60 to 65 is 60, 48, 42, 36, 30, 24, 21, 18, 15, or 12 months, respectively. The "Own Occupation Period" refers to the duration beginning at the end of the Elimination Period and ending at the end of the Maximum Benefit Period for insured employees.

The policy also includes a provision for partial disability, with the monthly benefit never falling below the minimum monthly benefit. If the maximum benefit period ends, or the insured employee dies, benefits cease. The maximum benefit per employee is $5,000 or the company's expected liability for the long-term disability claim, whichever is less.

For recurrent disabilities, a new elimination period is not required before further monthly benefits become payable. However, the maximum benefit period and other policy terms still apply.

According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, the Own Occupation Period for insured employees starts at the end of the Elimination Period and lasts until the end of the Maximum Benefit Period. During this period, Total Disability is considered if an employee cannot perform their main duties in their own occupation due to injury or sickness, even when part-time work is engaged in. After the Own Occupation Period, Total Disability is determined if the employee is unable to execute the main duties of any occupation that matches their training, education, or experience. The loss of a professional, occupational, or driver's license doesn't constitute Total Disability by itself. Partial Disability payments can be denied or suspended if the insured chooses not to engage in partial disability employment during these periods.

The maximum payable amount equals the company's expected claims liability and excludes services covered under the employee's health care plan or any other vocational rehabilitation program. Payments may be made to the service provider at the company's discretion. However, the policy will not cover a disability period for an insured employee who fails to complete the Vocational Rehab Program without good cause while receiving this benefit.

This information from Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf outlines key provisions regarding Prior Insurance Credit upon transfer of insurance carriers (pages 30-32), Family Income Benefit, and Family Care Expense Benefit (page 31). The policy ensures continued coverage for employees due to a change in carriers when they were insured and not actively working because of injury or sickness. If the employee was insured by the prior carrier at transfer but was Actively-At-Work on the Policy's Effective Date, they may receive benefits in accordance with the less restrictive policy.

For Total Disability due to a pre-existing condition, benefits are payable if the employee was insured by the prior carrier at transfer and was Actively-At-Work on the Policy's Effective Date. However, if the employee cannot satisfy either policy's Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion, no benefit will be paid.
