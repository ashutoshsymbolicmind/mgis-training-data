If the sub-specialty in which you are practicing is not recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties, you will be considered practicing in the general specialty category. For all other employees, your regular occupation means the material and substantial occupational duties as recognized in the general workplace, that you were routinely performing prior to becoming disabled. Unum will look at your occupation as it is normally performed in the national economy, instead of how the work tasks are performed for a specific employer or at a specific location.

Retirement Plan includes but is not limited to any plan which is part of any federal, state, county, municipal or association retirement system. SALARY CONTINUATION OR ACCUMULATED SICK LEAVE  means continued payments to you by your Employer of all or part of your monthly earnings, after you become disabled as defined by the Policy.  This continued payment must be part of an established plan maintained by your Employer for the benefit of all employees covered under the Policy.  Salary continuation or accumulated sick leave does not include compensation paid to you by your Employer for work you actually perform after your disability begins.  Such compensation is considered disability earnings, and would be taken into account in calculating your monthly payment. SELF-REPORTED SYMPTOMS  means the manifestations of your condition which you tell your physician, that are not verifiable using tests, procedures or clinical examinations standardly accepted in the practice of medicine. Examples of self-reported symptoms include, but are not limited to headaches, pain, fatigue, stiffness, soreness, ringing in ears, dizziness, numbness and loss of energy. SICKNESS  means an illness or disease.  Disability must begin while you are covered under the plan. SURVIVOR, ELIGIBLE  means your spouse, if living; otherwise your children under age 25 equally.

The Monthly Benefit is the total benefit amount for which an employee is insured under this plan, subject to a maximum benefit. Monthly Earnings refer to the gross monthly income from the Employer as defined in the plan. Monthly Payment is the employee's payment after deducting any sources of income. Part-Time Basis refers to the ability to work and earn between 20% and 80% of indexed monthly earnings.

It does not cover disabilities caused by pre-existing conditions, self-inflicted injuries, participation in a riot, loss of professional or occupational licenses, commission of crimes, war, or disabilities during incarceration. A pre-existing condition is defined as any medical treatment, consultation, care, or symptoms for which an ordinarily prudent person would have consulted a health care provider within three months before the policy's effective date, if the disability occurs in the first 12 months after coverage begins.\n\nIf an employee returns to work full-time and experiences another disability, Unum will treat it as part of the prior disability. The plan provides coverage for disabilities when an employee is not working due to sickness or injury, subject to premium payment. If an employer changes insurance carriers to Unum, payments may be sent if the disability results from a pre-existing condition under certain conditions: the employee must have been in active employment and insured under the plan on its effective date and also insured by the prior policy at the time of change. The employee must satisfy the pre-existing condition provision under either the Unum plan or the prior carrier's plan to receive a payment.\n\nThe policy also defines terms such as Monthly Benefit, Monthly Earnings, Monthly Payment, Part-Time Basis, Payable Claim, and Physician. The Monthly Benefit is the total benefit amount for which an employee is insured under this plan, subject to a maximum benefit. Monthly Earnings refer to the gross monthly income from the Employer as defined in the plan. Monthly Payment is the employee's payment after deducting any sources of income. Part-Time Basis refers to the ability to work and earn between 20% and 80% of indexed monthly earnings. A Payable Claim is a claim for which Unum is liable under the terms of the policy, and a Physician is a medical doctor who provides healthcare services."
