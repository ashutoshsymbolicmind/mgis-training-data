You will have access to all relevant documents as defined by applicable U.S. Department of Labor regulations.  The review of the adverse benefit determination will take into account all new information, whether or not presented or available at the initial determination.  No deference will be afforded to the initial determination. The review will be conducted by Unum and will be made by a person different from the person who made the initial determination and such person will not be the original decision maker's subordinate.  In the case of a claim denied on the grounds of a medical judgment, Unum will consult with a health professional with appropriate training and experience.  The health care professional who is consulted on appeal will not be the individual who was consulted during the initial determination or a subordinate.  If the advice of a medical or vocational expert was obtained by the Plan in connection with the denial of your claim, Unum will provide you with the names of each such expert, regardless of whether the advice was relied upon.",

        "content": "Prudent Actions by Plan Fiduciaries In addition to creating rights for Plan participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the employee benefit plan.  The people who operate your Plan, called \"fiduciaries\" of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other Plan participants and beneficiaries.  No one, including your Employer or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA. Enforce Your Rights If your claim for a benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules. Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights.  For instance, if you request a copy of Plan documents or the latest annual report from the Plan and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file suit in a federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Plan Administrator. If you have a claim for benefits that is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or federal court.  If it should happen that Plan fiduciaries misuse the Plan's money, or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a federal court.  The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees.  If you are successful, the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees.  If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, if, for example, it finds your claim is frivolous. Assistance with Your Questions If you have any questions about your Plan, you should contact the Plan Administrator.  If you have any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, or if you need assistance in obtaining documents from the Plan Administrator, you should contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210.
