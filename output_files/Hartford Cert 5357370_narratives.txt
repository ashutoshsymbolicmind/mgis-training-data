According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, during the disability period, a percentage of your base salary will be paid as Disability Benefits. To qualify, you must be unable to perform the essential functions of your regular occupation due to an injury or sickness. If you return to work while receiving these benefits, the Disabled and Working Benefit may apply, but payment will be reduced.

The Rehabilitative Employment Benefit is available if your employer offers a rehabilitation program and you participate in good faith. This benefit continues until the end of the maximum period of 24 months or when you no longer need rehabilitation assistance, whichever comes first.

Payment of benefits may cease under certain circumstances, such as returning to work at full pay, retirement, or reaching the policy's maximum duration limit. It is crucial to note that specific dates and terms applicable to your situation will be detailed in the policy documentation.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 35, rows 1-2), this long-term Disability insurance policy offers income protection for the policyholder if they become disabled due to a covered injury, sickness, or pregnancy. The policy provides coverage for up to age 67, with benefits payable monthly and equal to 60% of the insured's pre-disability earnings, subject to a maximum monthly benefit amount specified in the policy. Premiums are typically paid on a monthly basis. The definition of disability varies based on the elimination period selected by the policyholder (e.g., 90 days or 180 days). Additionally, the policy includes an optional cost-of-living adjustment rider and provides coverage for partial disabilities under certain conditions.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 35, row 2), you are required to share the cost of coverage. The contribution percentage varies based on the specific policy details provided. For instance, you might contribute 15%, while another party contributes the remaining 85%.

Keep in mind that non-payment may lead to coverage termination or other consequences as outlined in the policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, full-time active employees who are citizens or legal residents of the United States, its territories, and protectorates (excluding physicians) are eligible for coverage, provided they work at least 30 hours per week (excluding on-call hours). This applies to all employees except temporary, leased, or seasonal workers. The employment status must be full-time to qualify for coverage under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 35, rows 2-6 and 1, eligibility for coverage depends on your employment status with the Employer. If you begin working before the Participating Employer Effective Date, no waiting period applies. However, if you start after that date, a 90-day waiting period begins from your employment start date, with the coverage becoming effective on the first day of the month following this period. This waiting period is continuous and uninterrupted.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, disability benefits commence under two scenarios: injury (row 2) and sickness (row 4). For both cases, total disability must be sustained for a consecutive 30 days (rows 3 & 5). If the disabled individual is also working, benefit eligibility requires concurrent total disability status. The difference lies in the commencement date; injury-related disability benefits start from the 30th day of total disability, whereas sickness-related benefits are triggered one day later, on the 31st day of total disability.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, the weekly benefit is calculated as the lesser of three options: firstly, 60% of the earnings on which premiums have been paid for you; secondly, 60% of your pre-disability earnings; or thirdly, $1,500. Any Other Income Benefits are subtracted from this amount. This calculation ensures that the weekly benefit does not exceed the specified thresholds.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, benefits payable for injuries or sicknesses are limited to 9 weeks. The duration of coverage remains the same regardless of whether the disability is caused by injury or sickness. This policy applies only to eligible individuals and covers a maximum of 9 weeks' worth of benefits. It is essential to adhere to all policy terms and conditions for eligibility, including the proper filing of claims within the specified timeframe.
<EOS>
According to the Additional Benefits section of Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 9, row 1), the Disabled and Working Benefit is available. Eligible policyholders can receive a monthly payment equal to 20% of their pre-disability earnings if they become disabled and continue working in a reduced capacity during that period. The benefit payment begins after a 60-day waiting period following disability onset, and ends when the disability ceases or the total benefit amount reaches $3,000, whichever comes first. This benefit can be received concurrently with other disability benefits but may not exceed 100% of the pre-disability earnings. The maximum monthly payment is capped at $2,500, and the policyholder must meet all other policy requirements to qualify for this benefit.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, eligibility for coverage is extended to all individuals within the specified classes listed in the Schedule of Insurance (row 2, page 9). These Eligible Persons will have access to the insurance benefits as described in the policy documents. This coverage applies to all persons within the defined classes without distinction based on age, gender, or occupation unless explicitly stated otherwise.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, you will become eligible for coverage when either the Participating Employer's effective date is reached or if you have completed the Eligibility Waiting Period for Coverage shown in the Schedule of Insurance, if applicable. The eligibility period starts from the mentioned rows on page 36.
<EOS>
To enroll for coverage under this policy provided in Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, complete and sign a group insurance enrollment form within 31 days of becoming eligible. Deliver the completed form to your employer. Failure to enroll during this period or if you were previously eligible but did not enroll, future enrollment will require providing Evidence of Insurability acceptable to the insurer. If you choose to enroll at a later time under these circumstances, this evidence is vital for approval.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf section outlines the concept of Evidence of Insurability, a requirement for policy coverage that may involve completing and signing an approved application, undergoing a medical examination, providing an attending Physician's statement, and supplying any other necessary information. The Company covers all associated costs. If the supplied evidence is not deemed satisfactory, your weekly benefit will match what you would have received without providing Evidence of Insurability, but only if enrollment occurs within 31 days following eligibility. Failure to meet this deadline results in no coverage under the policy.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 10, rows 2-8, your insurance coverage will commence based on the earliest of three scenarios:

1) You become eligible and have enrolled by then,
2) Your enrollment within 31 days following your eligibility date, or
3) Our approval of your Evidence of Insurability for benefit amounts necessitating such proof. The coverage effective date applies to all scenarios mentioned above.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, the effective date for coverage or any changes in coverage, such as increased benefits or new benefits under the policy, will be deferred if you are not Actively at Work on the scheduled start date due to a physical or mental condition. The coverage will commence only when you return to active employment. This rule applies regardless of whether you are initially covered by the policy or undergoing an increase in benefits or acquiring a new benefit.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf pages [10, 11], you may decrease or increase your coverage options, with any increase subject to approval and effective on the Deferred Effective Date. Coverage adjustments occur upon changes in class or Pre-disability Earnings, but only if you are an Active Employee not absent due to Disability. Any notice of earnings change will not become effective until received by us. Policy modifications due to employer changes take effect on the date of the alteration, also subject to the Deferred Effective Date.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, if an individual was insured under a prior policy and was ineligible for benefits on the day before the Participating Employer Effective Date, the Deferred Effective Date provision will not apply. This means that regardless of when the new policy becomes effective, the individual is not eligible for coverage continuity from their previous policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, your policy coverage will terminate on the earliest of six possible scenarios: 1) the policy termination date, 2) when you are no longer eligible for coverage or the policy ceases to cover your class, 3) if a premium payment is not made when due, 4) upon termination of your employment by your employer, 5) if you are no longer Actively at Work, or 6) if your employer stops being a Participating Employer. However, this termination may be prevented under certain Continuation Provisions.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf details continuation provisions of coverage that can be extended beyond termination dates if the employer provides a uniform plan to all employees. Coverage may not exceed one continuation provision and is subject to reductions in policy terms, premium payments, and any applicable maximum time limits. Continued coverage ends when the policy terminates or the employer ceases being a participating employer.

  On documented leave of absence (excluding Family and Medical Leave or Military Leave), coverage can be continued until the month following the commencement of leave. Military leave of absence coverage may continue for up to 8 weeks, while Family Military Leave of Absence coverage (for spouses/children serving outside continental US, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, or Alaska) can last up to 15 days if specific conditions are met.

   Lay-offs due to lack of work allow continued coverage until the month following the commencement of lay-off, unless it becomes permanent. Status changes, such as being employed by the policyholder but no longer in an Eligible Class due to reduced hours, permit continued coverage for three consecutive months after the reduction in scheduled hours.

   Disability insurance allows continued coverage when working for the policyholder and receiving benefits under a Group Long Term Disability Insurance Policy while earning at least 20% but less than 80% of pre-disability earnings. If not actively at work due to sickness or injury, all coverages may be continued for up to 12 consecutive months or as required by applicable law if leave of absence is granted according to family and medical leave laws.

   Family Medical Leave allows coverage continuation for up to 8 weeks (or 26 weeks if eligible for Family Military Leave) following the commencement of leave, with continuation ending immediately if the leave terminates prematurely.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, if you become disabled and cease being an active employee, your insurance coverage will continue during your disability period and until the end of your short-term disability benefits entitlement. Afterward, your insurance can be reinstated under three conditions: first, you must return to work for one full day as a full-time active employee in an eligible class; second, the policy remains in force; and third, premiums for you were paid during your disability and continue to be paid.

According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 12 (rows 1-7), if you are entitled to disability benefits and your participating employer's coverage terminates, your benefits will continue as long as your disability persists by the same condition. However, these benefits will not extend beyond the date when we would have stopped paying benefits if the insurance had remained active. The termination of your participating employer's coverage for any reason will not affect our liability under this provision. Essentially, your disability benefits will end either when your disability resolves or on the original termination date of the insurance policy, whichever comes later.
<EOS>
Under the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, you are entitled to a Monthly Disability Benefit if you meet specific conditions: firstly, becoming Disabled while insured under this Policy; secondly, being Disabled for the entire Elimination Period; thirdly, remaining Disabled post the Elimination Period; and fourthly, submitting Proof of Loss. These benefits start from the day after the Elimination Period, with payments made monthly, subject to the Maximum Duration of Benefits constraint. Importantly, your benefits will not exceed this maximum duration.
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 12, rows 2-3), the calculation of benefits for a period less than a week is based on a daily rate. Specifically, if you're disabled for fewer than five days, we will pay one-fifth (1/5) of your weekly benefit for each day you are disabled. This means that for every day of disability in a week, you'll receive a fraction of your total weekly benefit.
<EOS>
Under the Disabled and Working Benefits outlined in Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, if you are disabled while covered but still working, your weekly benefit for total disability will be reduced by half of your current weekly earnings. If you participate in a rehabilitative employment program approved by us, we will calculate your weekly benefit according to the Rehabilitative Employment Benefit guidelines. Days spent disabled and working can contribute towards satisfying the Benefits Commence Period.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 12, rows 2-12), if you return to work as an active employee and then become disabled due to the same or a related cause within 15 consecutive calendar days, your initial disability period and the recurrent disability will be considered one period of disability, provided the policy remains in force. On the contrary, if you return to work for 15 consecutive days or more, any subsequent disability will be treated as a new disability.
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 12, rows 2-7), if a period of disability is extended due to a new cause while weekly benefits are payable, these benefits will persist provided the individual remains disabled. However, it's crucial to note that weekly benefits will not be paid beyond the end of the original maximum duration of benefits. Furthermore, any exclusions applicable to the new cause of disability will be enforced.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 41 and 42, your benefit payments will cease under the following conditions: firstly, upon recovery from disability; secondly, failure to provide Proof of Loss; thirdly, discontinuation of regular medical care; fourthly, refusal to undergo an examination by a physician or qualified professional; fifthly, your death; sixthly, the last day of the Maximum Duration of Benefits Table; seventhly, if your current monthly earnings exceed 80% of your indexed pre-disability earnings for occupation-based disability, or 60% for any occupation-based disability; eighthly, when no further benefits are payable under any provision that limits duration in the policy.
<EOS>
Under the Rehabilitative Employment Benefit outlined in Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages [13] rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3], if you are Totally Disabled or Disabled and Working, and accept Rehabilitative Employment, your Weekly Benefit will continue. However, we'll reduce your benefit by 50% of any income from this employment. The total Weekly Benefit plus income from Rehabilitative Employment must not exceed 100% of your Pre-disability Earnings. If it does, the excess reduces your Weekly Benefit. We reserve the right to review your Rehabilitative Employment while benefits are being paid under this policy. If you remain Totally Disabled or Disabled and Working after a period of Rehabilitative Employment, you may continue receiving Total Disability or Disabled and Working Benefits, subject to their respective Maximum Payment Periods.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, the policy does not provide coverage or benefits for disabilities that occur without regular medical care, are caused or worsened by war or act of war (declared or undeclared), result from a felony committed or attempted, arise from an illegal occupation, or are self-inflicted intentionally. Furthermore, if you were receiving or eligible for disability benefits from a previous employer-sponsored plan that terminated before this policy's effective date, no benefits will be paid under the current policy for the same disability.
<EOS>
According to the Notice of Claim section in Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (pages 13, rows 2-4), it is crucial to notify the Company within 20 days after Disability begins.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, within 15 days of receiving a Notice of Claim, we will send Proof of Loss forms.

This proof also requires details on medical professionals consulted, facilities treated, and prescription pharmacies within three years. The policyholder must provide authorization for the company to access their medical, employment, financial, and other necessary information. Additionally, a signed statement identifying all Other Income Benefits and proof that all available Other Income Benefits have been applied for is required.

<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf document outlines the Company's right to request additional proof of disability or fulfillment of other policy terms. Requirements include meeting with their representative, undergoing an examination by a chosen physician, vocational expert, functional expert, or professional. These interactions occur at the Company's expense and are as reasonably required. The Additional Proof of Loss must be acceptable to the Company. Refusal to cooperate may lead to denied, suspended, or terminated benefits, unless there is a valid reason for refusal. Your cooperation is crucial to maintaining your insurance benefits.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 46, rows 2-11, written Proof of Loss must be submitted within 90 days from the start date of the claim period for which payment is due. Failure to submit proof by this deadline will not automatically invalidate the claim if it was impossible to provide it in time and proof is subsequently given as soon as possible, but no later than one year after the deadline, unless the policyholder is not legally competent. The insurance company may request Proof of Loss throughout the duration of the disability, and in such cases, it must be provided within 30 days of the request.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, if you are deemed disabled and eligible for benefits under the policy, benefit payments will be issued at the end of each week that you are disabled. The insurance company may opt to make an advance payment based on their estimated duration of your disability. Any payment due after a claim is terminated will be issued once proof of loss acceptable to them is received.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, all payments for your claim will be made directly to you. In the event of your death, any outstanding benefits may be paid to your estate. If a payment is owed to your estate, a minor, or an incompetent person, up to $1,000 can be paid to a relative at the insurer's discretion. Such a payment will fulfill the responsibility for the amount disbursed.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 15, rows 2-12, if a claim for benefits is denied partially or entirely, you will receive a written notification detailing the reasons for the denial, referencing relevant policy provisions, describing any additional information required to substantiate the claim, and outlining the review procedure. The review process provides clarity on how to contest the decision.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, if your claim is denied, you or your representative have the right to appeal for a thorough review within specified timeframes. For claims requiring disability determination, requests must be made in writing within 180 days of receiving the denial notice. Non-disability claims should be appealed within 60 days. During this process, you can ask for copies of relevant documents and submit additional information related to your claim. The insurance company will respond with a final decision in writing.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf document details the arbitration process for disputes over Disability Benefits. If you disagree with a decision made after final review of your claim, you have the right to initiate arbitration by contacting the American Arbitration Association's main office in Washington, D.C. Proceedings will adhere to established Employee Benefit Plan Claim procedures by this association. The arbitration is conducted by a neutral, sole arbitrator selected from their approved panel for employee benefit disputes. Each party bears equally the cost of arbitration unless otherwise ordered by the arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision is final and binding, and it can be made into a court judgment in any jurisdiction with competent authority.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 15 rows 2-8, you must apply for Social Security disability benefits when your disability's duration meets the minimum required period. The application should be submitted within 45 days following our request for such documentation. If your eligibility is initially denied by the Social Security Administration, you are obligated to follow their established process for reconsideration and, if rejected again, request a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Hearing and Appeals.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (pages 15, 16) details how disability benefits under the United States Social Security Act are estimated and potentially deducted from your weekly benefit. The insurance company reserves the right to reduce your weekly benefit if they estimate that you or your dependent may be eligible for such benefits.

If eligible, the company may estimate the amount of these benefits and reduce your weekly benefit accordingly. However, reduction does not occur if you have applied for Social Security disability benefits, pursued all required appeals, authorized the Social Security Administration to release information, signed a reimbursement agreement, or if there's no possibility to appeal the denial from an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Hearing and Appeals.

If your weekly benefit has been reduced by an estimated amount and you later receive Social Security disability benefits, the company will adjust your weekly benefit upon receiving proof of the awarded amount. Conversely, if your application is denied, they will adjust your weekly benefit when you provide proof of final denial.

If the actual Social Security benefits were lower than the estimate, a refund will be issued in a lump sum. If higher and overpayments occurred on your weekly benefit, you must make a lump sum refund equal to all overpayments, adhering to the Overpayment Recovery provision.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, an overpayment occurs under this policy when the total paid benefits exceed what is due, or a payment is made that should have been allocated to another group policy. This can happen due to retroactive awards from sources within the Other Income Benefits definition, failure to report or late notification of Other Income Benefits or earned income, misstatements, fraud, errors, or any other related issues. Overpayments may stem from various causes such as incorrect reporting, late notice, or inaccurate information provided, among others.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, the insurer retains the right to recover any overpayments made under the policy within 30 days from the claimant. This includes refunding the amount directly or allowing recovery from other organizations, insurance companies, payees, or the estate. The insurer may also offset future benefits, refer unpaid balances to a collection agency, and pursue legal action if necessary. Any reimbursement agreement signed upon becoming eligible for benefits will further outline these terms.
<EOS>
According to the Subrogation section in Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 16, rows 2-10, if you sustain a Disability due to another party's act or omission and receive lost wage benefits under The Policy, failing to initiate legal action against that Third Party within a reasonable timeframe allows the company to exercise subrogation rights over any claims against the Third Party. The company may choose to pursue legal action against the Third Party for recovering payments made in connection with your Disability. This right persists until you take action yourself.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, the company reserves the right to be reimbursed for any disability benefits paid or due, if you recover compensation from a third party. This can occur via legal judgment, arbitration award, settlement, or other means. If such recovery occurs, you are obligated to repay the lower of: a) the amount the company paid or was due; or b) the recovered amount from the third party, minus any reasonable attorney fees related to the recovery. The amounts involved in this reimbursement are contingent on the details specified within these pages and rows.
<EOS>

This Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 17, rows 2-6) outlines the policy on Insurance Fraud.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, misstatements about the policyholder may result in premium adjustments and the use of accurate facts for coverage determination after three years of the policy being active during their lifetime.

However, this exception does not apply if the immediate family member is the only practicing physician in the area and is acting within their regular employment. The definition of 'Other Income Benefits' has been amended, removing all references to 'Your family'.

This information from Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page [59], rows [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1]) details policy adjustments for residents in Texas, Utah, and Vermont. For Texas residents, the Policy Interpretation is deleted. For Utah residents, the requirement for continuous insurance to exercise the Conversion Right increases to 6 consecutive months (if not already met), and the timeframe for Sending Proof of Loss changes to 90 days (also if not already met). In addition, the Policy Interpretation provision is replaced with a clause stating that benefits will only be paid if the plan administrator deems entitlement in their discretion. The administrator also has discretion over eligibility and plan interpretations. Judicial review of these determinations can be sought in federal court, but the reservation of discretion sets the scope of review should judicial review occur. For Vermont residents, this document does not provide specific policy adjustments mentioned.

According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, under Vermont law, health insurers are obligated to offer coverage equivalent to that given to married persons to parties involved in a civil union. This requirement is enforced on the specified document's page 59, row 2. The policy mandates equal coverage for civil unions and marriages without explicit distinction between the two partnership types.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, specifically rows 4-27 on page 59, outlines adjustments to the policy's definitions, terms, conditions, and provisions. Key changes include:

   - Terms like "marriage", "spouse", "dependent", "next of kin", "relative", "beneficiary", "survivor", "immediate family" now also apply to civil unions established according to Vermont law.
   - Terms related to the inception or dissolution of a marriage, such as "date of marriage", "divorce decree", and "termination of marriage", now encompass the equivalent events for civil unions under Vermont law.
   - Family relationships arising from a marriage, including "family", "immediate family", "dependent", "children", "next of kin", "relative", "beneficiary", and "survivor", also extend to those created by civil unions in Vermont.
   - A "dependent" is defined as a spouse, party to a civil union in Vermont, or a child (natural, stepchild, adopted, or dependent minor/disabled child) born or brought to a marriage or civil union under Vermont law.
   - A "child or covered child" refers to any child (natural, step-child, adopted, or dependent minor/disabled child) born or brought to a marriage or civil union in Vermont.
<EOS>
Under Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, Vermont law grants civil union partners equal benefits, protections, and responsibilities as married couples under state law. However, federal laws such as ERISA may limit or exclude these benefits for civil unions regarding private employer health plans. For example, government employers offer health benefits to dependents of civil union partners if they provide the same to spouses, while federal employers do not have this requirement. Group health insurance continuation rights and Internal Revenue Code treatment of premiums are also subject to federal law. As a result, access to certain benefits under this policy may vary for parties in a civil union and their families due to federal laws. Seek expert advice to understand your contract's specifics. For Washington residents, the Surviving Spouse definition in the Survivor Income Benefit is amended for civil unions.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (pages 27-28), a key change has been made to the General Work Stoppage continuation provision. If your employment ends due to a general work stoppage, such as a strike or lockout, your coverage will be extended during that time for up to six months. This extension will last until the end of the month in which your coverage initially terminated. However, if the work stoppage concludes before then, the continuation ceases immediately. The Policy Interpretation provision has been removed entirely. For Wisconsin residents, time periods stated in the Claim Appeal provision have been deleted. In all other aspects, the policy and certificates remain consistent. This information is signed for Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 32, row 1) outlines the Insurance coverage, specifying a Combined Single Limits (CSL) of $1,000,000 for Bodily Injury and Property Damage per accident. The policy provides coverage for accidents occurring on or off the premises of the insured location and during transportation to/from the premises with hired vehicles. It also includes a Medical Payments coverage of $5,000 per person for necessary medical expenses due to an injury caused by an accident under the policy.

Eligible individuals must endure this waiting period before they can avail themselves of the specified coverage and its associated benefits.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 34, rows 7-10, eligible individuals can enroll in the coverage.

According to the Pre-Existing Condition Limitation on Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, specific health conditions existing before the effective date of coverage may be subject to a waiting period of up to 12 months from the policy's inception. During this period, benefits may be limited, payable only at the greater of (a) the actual charges or (b) customary and reasonable charges for services rendered. After the waiting period, benefits will be provided at the policy's specified level, but certain conditions or complications related to the pre-existing condition may still be subject to a coinsurance requirement of 20% for two years following the end of the waiting period. Any treatment sought during the first year following the effective date that is directly or indirectly associated with the pre-existing condition will be covered only if it is considered medically necessary and not related to the pre-existing condition.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, page 67, row 1, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) section outlines the terms for Long Term Disability benefits. The policy provides monthly benefits equal to 60% of the pre-disability earnings, subject to a maximum of $15,000 per month and a minimum of $500 per month. The waiting period is six months following the date of disability, during which no benefits are payable. The benefit period for own occupation extends up to age 67 or until the insured returns to work in their own occupation. After that, the benefit period changes to any occupation and lasts until age 67. The policy further specifies that benefits will cease upon death of the insured.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 35 rows 2, 1, 2, and 3, full-time active employees who are citizens or legal residents of the United States are eligible for coverage. This excludes physicians, temporary, leased, or seasonal employees. Full-time employment is defined as working at least 30 hours weekly, not including on-call hours.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, the maximum monthly benefit is the least of three options: $6,000, the Benefit Percentage applicable to the policyholder multiplied by their Pre-disability Earnings on which premium has been paid, or the Benefit Percentage applicable to the policyholder multiplied by their Pre-disability Earnings. The calculation for the benefit amount takes into account the specified rows on page 35 of the document.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 35, rows 2-6, the Minimum Monthly Benefit is the greater of two options: $100 or 10% of the Maximum Monthly Benefit you're eligible for under The Policy, prior to deducting Other Income Benefits. This minimum benefit is a crucial aspect of the policy structure, ensuring a certain level of support during eligible claim periods.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, this policy outlines benefit payment durations based on age and retirement status. Prior to reaching Normal Retirement Age (NRA), benefits are payable for varying periods: 48 months if over 63 years old, 42 months if between 63-64, 36 months at 65, 27 months at 66, 24 months at 67, 21 months at 68, and 18 months at 69 and above. The NRA is defined by the Social Security Act's 1983 revision and varies depending on your birth year. For example, if born in 1955, your NRA is 66; while for those born in 1960 or later, it's 67. Benefits will be payable for a minimum of 18 months post-NRA.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, the Normal Retirement Age (NRA) varies depending on birth year. If born in 1937 or earlier, NRA is 65; for those born between 1938 and 1942, NRA ranges from 65 + 2 months to 65 + 10 months. Individuals born in 1943 through 1954 have an NRA of 66. After 1960, the NRA is 67. These ages are subject to adjustments if one retires before or after the specified age. For instance, penalties may apply for early retirement (before NRA) while delayed retirement credits can be earned for deferring retirement beyond the NRA.
<EOS>
This Family Care Credit Benefit, as detailed in Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 36, row 2), offers financial assistance when a policyholder is unable to work due to the need to provide care for a family member with a severe health condition. The benefit provides up to 60% of the policyholder's weekly earnings, subject to a maximum and minimum weekly limit, for a period of up to 12 months. To qualify, the family member must have a doctor's certification that they require full-time care due to a severe health condition. The benefit begins after a 30-day waiting period and can be used concurrently with other disability benefits, but not Short Term Disability or Business Overhead Expense benefits. It's essential to note that the policyholder must exhaust their Short Term Disability benefits before utilizing this Family Care Credit Benefit. The benefit is available only to the policyholder and not to any spouse or dependent covered under the policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on page 36, row 2, a Survivor Income Benefit is provided. This benefit ensures a specified percentage of the insured's monthly salary, ranging from 50% to 100%, for a predetermined period (up to age 65) or until the death of the beneficiary. The amount payable is based on the insured's annual base salary as of the date of disability and is subject to an annual cost-of-living adjustment. Eligibility for this benefit requires the insured to be under age 65 at the time of disability, have worked a minimum of 720 hours in the 18 months preceding the disability, and be unable to perform their regular job duties due to sickness or injury. The benefit starts after an elimination period (between 30 and 180 days) and continues until the earlier of the beneficiary's death or the insured reaching age 65.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf Workplace Modification Benefit (row 2, page 36) outlines coverage for necessary workplace modifications to accommodate an employee's occupational injury or illness. The policy provides up to $10,000 for such alterations with a maximum of $5,000 per calendar year. These changes can include job site adjustments, equipment alterations, or accommodative tools. The employer is responsible for the cost, and reimbursement is subject to prior approval. The policy also states that modifications should be made as soon as practicable but no later than 15 days after receipt of a written request from the employee or their authorized representative. Any changes deemed unreasonably delayed may result in the denial of benefits.
<EOS>
According to the Progressive Illness Benefit in Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 36, row 2), this policy provides a benefit for covered individuals diagnosed with a specified critical or chronic illness. To qualify, the individual must be confined to a hospital, nursing home, or hospice facility due to the illness. The benefit is payable in a lump sum of up to $50,000 upon diagnosis and an additional $10,000 annually for as long as the condition persists. This benefit does not apply during the first 24 months following the policy's effective date unless hospital confinement occurs within this period. The covered illnesses include, but are not limited to, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis, among others. The list of conditions is subject to change.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf benefit, detailed on page 36 row 2, offers Accidental Dismemberment and Loss of Sight coverage. Upon the accidental loss of sight in both eyes or dismemberment due to an injury, the policyholder is eligible for a lump-sum payment equivalent to 150% of their basic benefit. The maximum amount payable is $375,000, with prorated payments based on the extent and severity of loss. This benefit will remain active until the policy expiration date provided in the policy documents.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 68, row 2), Eligible Persons for coverage are those individuals or entities specified in the Schedule of Insurance. This means that only the persons detailed within this schedule are qualified to receive benefits under the policy's terms and conditions. It is essential to carefully review the Schedule of Insurance to ensure understanding of who qualifies for coverage, as this document plays a crucial role in determining eligibility.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, it is outlined that providing satisfactory Evidence of Insurability is essential to securing coverage under The Policy. This evidence may involve a completed and approved application, medical examination, attending physician's statement, and any additional information required by us. All costs related to this evidence will be covered by us. If the provided evidence is deemed unsatisfactory, there are consequences: 1) Your Monthly Benefit equals the amount for which you were eligible without providing Evidence of Insurability, granted enrollment occurs within 31 days of your initial eligibility; or 2) You will not be covered under The Policy if enrollment happens more than 31 days after initial eligibility.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf at pages 68, rows 2-1, your coverage will commence on the date you become eligible. However, it's essential to note that all effective dates are subject to the Deferred Effective Date provision. This means that while your policy technically begins when you're eligible, there may be a delay in its activation due to specific policy conditions. Please review your policy for further details on these provisions.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 37 rows 2-14, your insurance or increased coverage effective date will be deferred if you are absent from work due to accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse, pregnancy, and you would have otherwise started the coverage on that day. The deferment will last until you actively return to work for one full day. This provision applies to all five scenarios mentioned.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, you can either decrease or increase your coverage options, including upgrading to a higher tier. Approval is required for any increase, with effective dates deferred due to pre-existing conditions and subject to your active employment status. A change in your class or rate of pay may lead to increased or decreased coverage on the corresponding date, provided you are actively employed and not disabled at that time. Notification of earnings changes is necessary but takes effect only when received by the insurance provider. In case of policy alterations by the employer, adjustments become effective immediately, still subject to deferred effective dates and pre-existing conditions limitations.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages [37, 38], if coverage was under a prior policy but not eligible for benefits the day before the Participating Employer Effective Date, the Deferred Effective Date provision does not apply. If insured under the new policy and covered under the prior policy on the day before the Participating Employer Effective Date, the Pre-existing Condition Limitation ends on the earliest of either the Participating Employer Effective Date (if unlimited by pre-existing condition restriction under the prior policy) or the date the restriction would have ceased under the prior policy. The Monthly Benefit for a Pre-existing Condition will be the lesser of the amount paid by the prior policy or the new policy. The Pre-existing Conditions Limitation applies after the Participating Employer Effective Date to benefit increases from changes in policies, options, classes, or benefits. If disabled under the prior policy and return to work as a Full-time Active Employee before the Participating Employer Effective Date, and have a recurrence of that disability within 6 months while covered by the new policy with no benefits available for the recurrence under the prior policy, the Elimination Period will be waived.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, your coverage terminates on the earliest of seven events: policy termination, no longer insuring your class, unpaid premiums or missed payment dates, the end of the premium period, employment termination or ceasing to be a full-time active employee in an eligible class for any reason, or your employer ceasing to participate. Continuation provisions may apply if these events occur unless specified otherwise.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf section on pages [38, 39] outlines continuation provisions for insurance coverage. Coverage can be extended past the termination date if an employer offers a consistent plan to all employees and pays premiums. Continued coverage is subject to policy reductions, terminating when the policy does, the employer ceases participation, or coverage for your class terminates. Your benefit level will remain as it was before continuation.

Family Military Leave of Absence allows continued coverage for up to 15 days if your spouse or child enters active military service outside specific locations, provided you meet certain employment and service requirements. Family Medical Leave enables up to 8 weeks (or 26 weeks if also qualifying for military leave) of insurance continuation following the start of a leave granted under the Family and Medical Leave Act or similar state/local law. Continuation ends immediately if the leave terminates early.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 39 rows 2-6, if you become disabled and stop being an active employee, your insurance coverage will continue under specific conditions. Firstly, during the Elimination Period while you remain disabled by the same disability. Secondly, following the Elimination Period, your coverage will last as long as you are entitled to benefits under the policy. Essentially, this means that if you're disabled and no longer an active employee, your insurance will be extended during the defined elimination period, and thereafter, for as long as the policy allows based on your eligibility for benefits.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 39 rows 2-6, no premiums will be charged for the insured after the Elimination Period ends and as long as benefits are still being paid out. This waiver of premium applies solely when receiving insurance benefits due to a disability. It is essential to note that the Elimination Period varies among policies, so it's crucial to consult the specific terms of your policy for details on its duration.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, it is stated that if you become disabled and your participating employer's coverage terminates, your benefits will continue as long as your disability persists by the same condition. However, these benefits will not extend beyond the date when payments would have ceased if the insurance had remained active. The termination of the participating employer's coverage for any reason will not affect our liability under this provision. In other words, your benefits will continue for the same disability until they would have ended had the insurance remained active.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (pages 39-40), if your insurance terminates due to employment cessation not caused by retirement or ineligibility for an eligible class, and you've been insured continuously for at least 12 months, are able to perform duties of your occupation, the policy is still active, and you're not covered under another group policy, you have a right to enroll in their group long term disability conversion policy within 31 days. To do so, you must submit a written request along with the premium and enrollment fee for the conversion policy. The coverage will be effective the day after your current policy ends and issued without Evidence of Insurability. The terms, including type, amount, and premium for the group long term disability conversion Policy will depend on the insurance provided by the conversion policy at the time of enrollment. This conversion may offer different benefits compared to the original policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 40 rows [2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], benefits for mental illness or substance abuse disabilities are subject to a maximum duration. Disabling conditions such as those resulting from any cause (mental illness) or under treatment (alcoholism), or non-medical use of certain substances will have limited benefits payable. These benefits can last either until your confinement in a medical facility ends, or for a total of 24 months across all such disabilities during your lifetime, if you're not confined or after discharge.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, any periods of recovery during the elimination period won't affect it if your active work days are less than half the length of your elimination period. Days within this recovery period don't count towards the elimination period. After the elimination period ends, if you recover from disability but become disabled again due to the same or a related cause within 365 days, these instances will be considered as one continuous period of disability, provided the policy remains active. If you remain non-disabled for 365 days or more, any subsequent disabilities are treated as new ones with their own elimination period and maximum duration of benefits, subject to the terms and conditions in effect at that time.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, page 40, row 2, the term 'Recover' or 'Recovery' indicates that your disability status has changed, and you are no longer disabled as you have returned to work with your employer. Notably, premiums for you will be paid during this period. This change in status may affect the policy benefits, so it is crucial to review the policy details accordingly.
<EOS>
Under the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, your Disability benefits are calculated when you're disabled after the Elimination Period and earning 20% or less of your Indexed Pre-disability Earnings. The Monthly Benefit is determined by multiplying your Pre-disability Earnings by the Benefit Percentage. This figure is compared with the Maximum Benefit, and from the lesser amount, Other Income Benefits are deducted to arrive at your Monthly Benefit.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, during disability and if you earn more than 20% of your indexed pre-disability earnings, your monthly benefit for up to 12 consecutive months will be determined by multiplying your pre-disability earnings by the benefit percentage. The maximum benefit applies. Other income benefits are deducted from this amount, but current monthly earnings won't reduce your monthly benefit.

However, if the sum of your monthly benefit and current monthly earnings exceeds 100% of your pre-disability earnings, your monthly benefit will be reduced by the excess. The 12 consecutive month period begins on the last of either the day you start earning more than 20% or the end of the elimination period.

If you're disabled, not receiving benefits under the Return to Work Incentive, and earn more than 20%, your monthly benefit will be the greater of either the Proportionate Loss Formula or the 50% Offset Formula. These guidelines apply to rows [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] on page [41].
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on page 41 row 5, the policy outlines an Indexed Pre-disability Earnings benefit. If you become disabled and your earnings are less than 20% of your pre-disability income, you will receive a monthly benefit based on that percentage difference. This benefit is adjusted annually using a cost of living adjustment (COLA) formula until the end of the policy term or your return to work, whichever occurs first. The pre-disability earnings considered are the average of your 36 months' worth of earnings prior to disability, indexed to the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 41, rows 1-5 and 1-2, if the sum of your Monthly Benefit, Current Monthly Earnings, and Other Income Benefits surpasses 100% of your Pre-disability Earnings, your Monthly Benefit will be reduced by the excess. However, it will not fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit. Additionally, in case of an overpayment, recovery of all or part of the overpayment may occur, following the Overpayment Recovery provision.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on page 41, row 2, your Monthly Benefit under this policy will never fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit as stated in the Schedule of Insurance. This ensures a certain level of coverage throughout the duration of the policy, providing financial support during times of need.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 41, rows 2 and 3, if a Monthly Benefit is payable for a period less than a month, the benefit will be calculated as one-thirtieth (1/30) of the Monthly Benefit for each day you are disabled. This means that if you are disabled for 10 days in a month, you will receive 10/30 of your monthly benefit for that period. This calculation is based on the total number of days in the month, not just the days you were disabled. This policy applies to situations where the disability occurs anywhere within the month, regardless of when it starts or ends.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, Family Care Credit Benefit allows deduction of Family Care expenses from earnings while in a Rehabilitation program. This benefit applies to care or supervision of children under 13 or mentally/physically handicapped dependents within the household. Monthly deductions are capped at $350 for the first 12 months, then $175 thereafter, not exceeding monthly earnings. Annual Family Care Credit cannot surpass $2,500, and deductions are reduced proportionally for periods less than a month. Documented receipts from caregivers are required, and this benefit ceases once Rehabilitation ends or Family Care Credits have been deducted for 24 months during Disability. No Family Care provided by relatives is eligible as a deduction. Monthly Benefit eligibility requires Current Monthly Earnings after the Family Care Credit deduction to be less than 80% of Pre-disability Earnings.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on page 42 (rows 2-8, 1-2), if you are receiving a Monthly Disability Benefit at the time of your death, your survivors may receive a Survivor Income Benefit. This benefit will be paid upon receipt of satisfactory proof of your death and the claimant's entitlement. Proof must be submitted within one year following your death.

The Survivor Income Benefit is payable to: 1) your surviving spouse, if any; 2) if no spouse, equally to your children; or 3) if no spouse or children, to your estate. However, any overpayment on your claim will be deducted first. The Survivor Income Benefit is calculated as three times your Maximum Monthly Benefit.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 42, rows 2-10), a Surviving Spouse is defined as the legally non-separated or non-divorced spouse at the time of policyholder's death. However, a domestic partner or civil union partner may be considered as well, under two conditions: firstly, if a domestic partner affidavit demonstrating partnership for The Policy has been executed and found satisfactory by the insurer; secondly, if registration as a domestic partner or civil union member is available through a government agency or office. Proof of such registration must be provided unless doing so is legally prohibited. Continued eligibility is contingent upon meeting the requirements detailed in the affidavit or mandated by law.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, Surviving Children are defined as unmarried children, stepchildren, or legally adopted children who were primarily dependent on the policyholder for support and maintenance at the time of death. These children must be under age 21, or between ages 21 and 25 while in full-time attendance at an institution of learning. Additionally, any children related to the policyholder by blood or marriage or domestic partnership who lived with them in a regular parent-child relationship and were eligible as dependents on the policyholder's federal income tax return for the last tax year before death are also considered Surviving Children. If a minor child is entitled to benefits, payments may be made to their caregiver until a legal guardian is appointed.

This Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf section discusses the Workplace Modification Benefit, applicable on page numbers [43] rows [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The policy reimburses an employer for reasonable workplace modifications to accommodate a covered disability, enabling the policyholder's return as an active employee. Qualification hinges on: (1) coverage under the policy; (2) employer agreement to make accommodative workplace changes; and (3) written approval of proposed modifications by the insurer. Approved modifications' reimbursement does not surpass the amount equal to item number 1 of the Maximum Monthly Benefit.

The insurer reserves the right to examine or evaluate the policyholder by a healthcare professional, vocational expert, or rehabilitation specialist. After the proposed modifications are complete, proof of expenses is provided, and the policyholder returns to work as an active employee, the employer's costs for approved modifications will be reimbursed.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf segment discusses Workplace Modification and the Progressive Illness Benefit on pages 43, rows 2, 3, 1, 2, 3. If you are disabled, changes to your work environment or job duties (Workplace Modification) will be made to accommodate you. This benefit payment will not impact any other policy benefits you may be entitled to.

If you're diagnosed with a Progressive Illness after becoming eligible for this policy benefit, and can provide satisfactory proof from your physician, you'll qualify for the Progressive Illness Benefit.

According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 43, rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2]), a Progressive Illness is defined as a non-infectious, indefinite disease or disorder that gradually impairs one's ability to perform their own occupation. If you become disabled due to such an illness, your pre-disability earnings will be the greater of either the amount confirmed by your physician at the time of proof submission or the amount at the time of disability under this policy. Benefits for disability resulting from a Progressive Illness are calculated using these pre-disability earnings and adhere to all other policy terms effective on the date of disability. Premiums are based on either the greater of your pre-disability earnings under this benefit or your pre-disability earnings according to the policy, until you meet the criteria for disability under this policy. Your premium will not decrease below the rate paid at the time proof of Progressive Illness is submitted unless you qualify for Waiver of Premium under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf pages 43 and 44, under the Accidental Dismemberment and Loss of Sight Benefit section, if an insured individual sustains a bodily injury in an accident within the covered policy period, a monthly benefit will be paid for the specified number of months following the Elimination Period. This payout is applicable for any of the listed losses: loss of sight in one or both eyes; or loss of limb(s), partial loss of limb(s), or loss of thumb and index finger on one hand. The benefit amount will be paid for at least the number of months indicated opposite each loss. This benefit is only payable if these losses occur within 365 days after the date of the accident.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 44 and the subsequent rows, the policy outlines various scenarios involving loss or impairment of different body parts:

- Loss or impairment of both hands results in a weekly indemnity of $2,688, payable for life.
- Loss or impairment of both feet has the same lifetime payment amount of $2,688.
- The loss or impairment of one hand and one foot entails a weekly payment of $1,750, also for life.
- Similarly, the loss or impairment of one hand and one eye leads to a weekly payment of $1,750, payable for life.
- The same goes for the loss or impairment of one foot and one eye; it attracts a weekly payment of $1,750, payable for life.
- Loss or impairment of either one hand or one foot results in a weekly payment of $1,349, payable for 5 years from the date of loss.
- It's essential to note that partial loss or impairment could also qualify for benefits according to other sections, with specific percentages detailed elsewhere in the policy. The current section primarily focuses on complete loss or impairment scenarios.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, under section One Eye, it is detailed that the monthly benefit amount for a thumb and index finger injury on either hand is based on two conditions:

1) The amount should be the lesser of the Maximum Monthly Benefit stated in the policy's Schedule of Insurance, or
2) Your Pre-disability Earnings multiplied by the Benefit Percentage.

This means that the benefit received will not exceed the maximum specified in the policy, or what you were earning prior to the disability times the percentage shown in the policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, loss is defined in terms of specific physical impairments. These include the actual severance of hands and feet above the wrist or ankle joints, complete and irreversible paralysis of certain limbs, the entire and irrecoverable loss of sight, speech, and hearing, and the actual severance of the thumb and index finger above the metacarpophalangeal joints. These events must occur to trigger the insurance coverage outlined in the document.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, under the Pre-existing Conditions Limitation on pages 44 rows [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], no benefits will be paid or increased for a Disability resulting from or caused or worsened by a Pre-existing Condition unless:

1. The insured has not received Medical Care for the condition during the previous 6 consecutive months while under The Policy; or
2. The insured has been continuously insured under The Policy for 12 consecutive months.
<EOS>
According to the terms outlined in Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 44 and 45 (rows 2-4, 5-7, 1-1, 2-3, 4), any pre-existing condition includes accidental bodily injuries, sicknesses, mental illnesses, pregnancies, or substance abuse issues, as well as their respective manifestations, symptoms, findings, or aggravations. These conditions must have received medical attention within the six months prior to either your coverage's effective date or a change in coverage.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 45 rows 2-5, medical care is covered when a physician or healthcare provider consults, offers advice, recommends, prescribes, or provides treatment. This policy covers necessary and reasonable medical services, supplies, equipment, hospitalization, diagnostic tests, surgery, and prescription medications, among other healthcare expenses. The policy also outlines maximum limits for each category of care, as well as deductibles and co-insurance percentages that apply to the insured's costs. Additionally, this section specifies pre-existing conditions exclusions, exceptions, and limitations, including a waiting period before coverage begins for such conditions.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 45 rows 2-5, the treatment coverage includes medical examinations, tests, and attendance or observation, as well as the use of drugs, medicines, medical services, supplies, or equipment. This comprehensive coverage applies to all necessary expenses associated with these services, subject to policy limits and terms. Additionally, it is important to note that this coverage may require prior authorization and pre-existing conditions may be subject to specific guidelines.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf pages 76 and 77, you or the beneficiary must provide written notice of a claim within 30 days following either the date of death or the date of loss. If providing notice within this timeframe is impossible, it should be given as soon as reasonably practical. The notice must include the claimant's name, address, and the Participating Employer Account Number.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 77 rows 2, 3, and 4, the policy requires a Proof of Loss claim submission within 15 days of notice. If no forms are provided within this timeframe, the claimant may submit alternative written proof that fully describes the nature and extent of the claim. Essentially, the company has 15 days to send the claim forms; if they fail to do so, any comprehensive written proof will be accepted.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, benefits are issued when a claimant is confirmed disabled and eligible (row 2-9, page 46). Payments are made at the end of each month while the claimant remains disabled (row 2). The insurance company may elect to make advance benefit payments based on an estimated duration of disability (row 3). If any payment is due after a claim's termination, it will be issued upon receiving satisfactory Proof of Loss (row 9).
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 46, rows 2-12), a claim denial notification will be provided in writing, detailing the specific reasons for the rejection and referencing the relevant policy provisions. The notification will also describe any additional information required to substantiate the claim, explaining why it's necessary, as well as outlining the review procedure. This process ensures transparency regarding claim denials.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, if your claim is denied, you or your representative have the right to request a full and fair review within specified timeframes: either 180 days for claims requiring determination of disability or 60 days for those not needing such determination. You may also ask for all relevant documents, records, and information, and submit additional written comments, documents, or information related to your claim. The insurer will then provide a final decision on the claim in writing.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 47 rows 2-8, you must apply for Social Security disability benefits when your disability's duration satisfies the minimum requirement. You have 45 days from our request to make this application. If the Social Security Administration initially denies your benefits eligibility, you are expected to adhere to their appeals process and subsequently request a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Hearing and Appeals if denied again.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, the insurance company reserves the right to reduce your disability benefits by estimating Social Security benefits you or your dependents may receive. This reduction occurs if they determine eligibility and estimate the benefit amount. Reductions will not apply if you've applied for SS disability benefits, pursued all appeals, authorized information release, signed a reimbursement agreement, and returned it.

If the estimated reduction is later found incorrect due to awarded or denied benefits, adjustments will be made accordingly. Overpayments will be refunded in a lump sum if SS benefits are lower than estimated, but you'll need to return all overpayments if higher. These rules follow the Overpayment Recovery provision.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, an overpayment is defined as the situation where the total benefits paid exceeds what you were entitled to under this policy or when a payment is made that should have been allocated to another group policy. This may arise from various circumstances such as retroactive awards from specified sources, failure to report other income benefits or earned income in a timely manner, misstatements, fraudulent activities, or any errors made by The Hartford.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 47 and 48, the policyholder grants The Company the right to recover any determined overpayment within 30 days. If reimbursement is late, The Company can recuperate overpayments from the policyholder, other organizations, insurance companies, payment recipients, or their estate; reduce or offset future benefits payable; refer the unpaid balance to a collection agency; and pursue legal action in court. Overpayments may be recovered from any source specified in a reimbursement agreement required upon benefit eligibility under The Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, if you suffer a Disability due to a Third Party's act or omission and receive lost wage benefits from the policy, failing to initiate legal action against the Third Party within a reasonable timeframe allows the company to be subrogated to any rights you may have against them. The company then has the option to bring legal action against the Third Party for recovering any payments made in relation to your Disability.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 48, rows 2, any third party whose actions or negligence contribute to you experiencing a Disability will have benefits paid or payable under the policy. This term, Third Party, encompasses individuals and legal entities alike. The Disability-related benefits are contingent upon this third party's role in causing your disability. The policy outlines specific conditions under which these benefits can be claimed and the corresponding payment structure.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, legal action against us can only be initiated under two timeframes. Firstly, such action cannot commence earlier than sixty days after the submission of a Proof of Loss. Secondly, any legal action must occur no later than three years following the date when the Proof of Loss is required to be given according to The Policy's terms.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, bonuses are defined as the monthly average of monetary rewards you received from your employer during the calendar year preceding your disability onset (if more than the total duration of your employment), or throughout your entire tenure with the employer if it's shorter.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, disability is defined as the inability to perform one or more essential duties of any occupation due to accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse, or pregnancy. During the elimination period, your disability must prevent you from performing the duties of your current occupation. If your monthly earnings during this period are 80% or more of your pre-disability earnings, the elimination period is extended for another 12 months, or until your current monthly earnings fall below 80%. After the elimination period, disability is determined based on any occupation. Your failure to maintain a license does not necessarily mean you are disabled, and having a suspended, revoked, restricted, or surrendered license does not qualify as disability.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (pages 50, rows 2-4), the Indexed Pre-disability Earnings are your pre-disability income adjusted annually by 5%. The first adjustment occurs on the first day of the month following receipt of 12 months of benefits. After this initial adjustment, annual increases will be made, with each increment also equating to a 5% increase, compounded yearly on the first day of the month following each anniversary of the initial adjustment date.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, your pre-disability earnings are defined as the regular monthly rate of pay from your employer, derived either from your W-2 earnings for the full tax year immediately preceding your last active work day before disability or for a lesser period if you worked for fewer than twelve consecutive months. This figure encompasses your wage income and contributions made through salary reduction agreements to 401(k), 403(b), 457 deferred compensation arrangements, executive non-qualified deferred compensation plans, or IRC Section 125 salary reduction plans for the same period. These earnings are crucial in determining your disability benefits.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (rows 2, 1 on pages 51 and 52), the term "Prior Policy" refers to the long-term disability insurance held by the Participating Employer on the day preceding a specific event.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 52, rows 2-4), your occupation is defined as the job you regularly performed before disability set in. It's not tied to a specific employer or location. For physicians, this means the general or sub-specialty recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS). If your sub-specialty isn't recognized by ABMS, you fall under the general specialty category. This definition applies universally across all occupations in this policy.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, primarily on page [60], defines "Spouse" as either your legally married partner or domestic partner, given that you meet specific criteria. If you are in a domestic partnership:

1. You must have executed a domestic partner affidavit acceptable to the company, proving your domestic partnership status for the policy.
2. Alternatively, you may register as domestic partners with a government agency where such registration is available and provide proof of this registration unless it's prohibited by law.

According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, any life insurance amount in force for the policyholder may be subject to reduction under two circumstances: firstly, through exercise of the Conversion Right or secondly, via the Portability provision.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, the Life Insurance Benefit and Principal Sum will be decreased based on the table provided, effective from the ages stated in the document. This reduction takes effect on any existing coverage immediately prior to that date. If you become covered under the policy or experience a coverage increase after reaching age 65, reductions also apply to the current amount of coverage following all previous reductions. The specific percentage reduction for your coverage is indicated in the table.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 68 (rows 1-14, then 1-2), the reduction in coverage for various levels follows: 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, and 90% at rates of 35% and 25%.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, Waiver of Premium allows the policyholder to continue their Life Insurance coverage without paying premiums when disabled and qualified for Waiver of Premium.

This provision applies only to the policy details outlined in rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] on page [70].
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 70, rows 2 and 1, this policy pertains solely to Your Basic Life Insurance.

According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 70, rows 2-10, Disability is defined as an incapacity to perform any work for which you are or could be qualified by education, training, or experience due to injury or sickness.

3. Throughout all this, you must have been actively employed under the policy to qualify for Waiver of Premium.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages [70, 71], if a Waiver of Premium is approved, the waiver will commence from a specified date. However, premiums won't be waived during the first 6 months of disability. The insurer may require Proof of Loss and periodic examinations during the initial 2 years following the submission of the first Proof of Loss. Failure to submit required proof or refusal to be examined may lead to the termination of the Waiver of Premium.

If the application for Waiver of Premium is denied, the policyholder may continue coverage under the Portability Benefit or convert coverage in accordance with the Conversion Right. If a disabled individual works for 5 days or less during the first 6 months of disability, the waiting period will not be interrupted. The individual must remain disabled by the same condition for the entire 6-month period, except for the initial 5 days worked. Working for more than 5 days requires a new waiting period to be satisfied.

According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, if you die within a year of your last active employment day before qualifying for Waiver of Premium, and meet certain conditions, your insurance will be payable. The conditions are: you must have been continuously disabled, this disability must have lasted or would have lasted for six months or more, and premiums must have been paid for the coverage. If these conditions are met, the amount of life insurance in force for you will be paid out.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, the Waiver of Premium will continue your coverage during disability until Normal Retirement Age if you're disabled before age 60. Afterwards, if you return to work in an Eligible Class as an Active Employee, you may be eligible for renewed coverage provided premiums are paid on time. If you don't return to such employment, coverage will end, and you might have a Conversion Right option within the specified time frame, subject to terms and conditions. The Amount of Life Insurance convertible is subject to the Conversion Right's terms, and Portability won't be available.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 71, rows 2-8), if your policy terminates or your employer stops being a Participating Employer before you qualify for the Waiver of Premium, you may have the Conversion Right, but only within specified time limits. Additionally, you might still be eligible for Waiver of Premium upon qualification. However, if the policy terminates or your employer ceases after you qualify for the Waiver of Premium, your coverage under this provision remains unaffected.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, the Life Insurance Benefit is payable upon your death while covered under The Policy. Payment will be made after receiving a Proof of Loss in accordance with the policy's Proof of Loss provision. The Life Insurance Benefit distribution adheres to the General Provisions outlined within The Policy.
<EOS>
Under Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, if you're terminally ill, aged under 60, and insured for at least $10,000, you may request an Accelerated Benefit (up to 80% of the policy amount, with a minimum of $3,000 and a maximum of $500,000). Requests must be in writing. The death benefit will be reduced by the Accelerated Benefit Amount. If terminally ill, you'll also meet the Disabled for Waiver of Premium definition. However, if required by law or a government agency to accelerate benefits, you must still fulfill all terms and conditions. If there's an assignment of rights regarding your life insurance, we need a release from the assignee before benefits are payable.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 72 (rows 2, 3, 1, 2), the policy holder must provide satisfactory proof of terminal illness for ongoing claims. This proof must be supplied by a physician. Failure to do so or refusal to undergo an examination as required could result in denial of the Accelerated Benefit payment.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 72 rows [2-11], if you are no longer terminally ill, your coverage may persist under specific conditions. If you return to an Eligible Class and pay the premium, coverage remains. If not, continued disability (subject to Waiver of Premium provision) maintains coverage. Upon leaving both Eligible Class and Disabled status, coverage terminates, but Conversion Right may be exercised within certain limits. The coverage amount is reduced by any Accelerated Benefit paid.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, if your life insurance coverage or any portion ends for any reason, you may have the right to convert it into an individual policy without providing Evidence of Insurability. However, conversion is not available for Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefits or any ineligible/uncovered amounts. If your policy terminates, coverage for an Eligible Class ends, or your employer is no longer a Participating Employer, you must have been insured for 5 years to convert; the limit is $10,000 or less than the policy's life insurance benefit if you become eligible for group life insurance within 31 days of termination. If coverage ends for other reasons, the full amount may be converted.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, at row 2 on page 73, 'Insurer' in this context refers to either us or another insurance company that has agreed to issue policies according to the Conversion Right. This provision allows you to convert your policy into a new one under different terms without providing evidence of insurability, as long as the conversion is made within specific timeframes and certain eligibility criteria are met. Typically, this right must be exercised within 365 days from the later of (1) the date the original policy terminates or lapses, or (2) the effective date of any change in the terms under which your coverage is provided that would be materially detrimental to you. The new policy issued will not contain any exclusion for a condition, illness, or injury based on its existence before the effective date of the new policy. Additionally, the new policy premium rate will not exceed the maximum permitted by law.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf outlines the process to convert your coverage. To initiate conversion, complete a Notice of Conversion Right form and get your employer's signature. Submit this within 31 days after Life Insurance termination or 15 days from your employer's signature, whichever is later, but not more than 91 days post-termination. The insurer will verify eligibility and send a Conversion Policy proposal. You must complete the request form in this proposal, pay the required premium within the specified time period, and return it to activate coverage effective from the 32nd day after coverage ends. This new policy replaces previous coverage for the stated amount under The Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, the Conversion Policy issued upon terminating The Policy offers Life Insurance coverage only, based on the Insurer's rates for new applicants of your class and age at the time of conversion. It does not offer the same terms as The Policy or provide additional benefits such as term insurance. Conversion is unavailable for any amount of Life Insurance being continued under certain provisions like Waiver of Premium, Portability, or Continuation until such coverage ends.
<EOS>
In the event of your death within 31 days after insurance coverage under Hartford Cert 5357370 terminates, we will pay the life insurance amount you would have been eligible to convert. This is contingent upon receiving Proof of Loss. However, if a conversion policy has already been initiated, no life insurance benefit will be provided from this policy for the converted amount.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 73, rows 2 and 3, Portability is a provision that enables policyholders to continue their coverage under a Group Portability policy when usual coverage termination would occur due to qualifying events. These events may include loss of eligibility for group insurance, retirement, COBRA exhaustion, or qualifying Medicare enrollment. The continuation period can last up to 36 months from the qualifying event date, during which premiums will remain the same as those under the group policy. Premium payments must be made on a monthly basis and failure to do so may result in loss of coverage. It's crucial to note that this provision may have specific eligibility requirements and exclusions; always refer to your policy for details.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 73 rows 2-6, qualifying events for policyholders include:

1. Termination of employment prior to Normal Retirement Age, or
2. Ending membership in an Eligible Class under the policy. These qualifying events enable policyholders to access their retirement benefits. The Normal Retirement Age varies, but it's typically a specified age stipulated within the policy terms.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, page [74], to elect Portability for your coverage after Basic ends due to a Qualifying Event, the policy must still be active and your employer must remain a Participant Employer. To apply, complete and obtain your employer's signature on a Portability application, submit it along with the required premium within 31 days of Life Insurance termination or 15 days from your employer signing the application, whichever is later, but not more than 91 days after termination. After verifying eligibility, we will issue a certificate for Portability coverage under a new policy, effective the day after Basic ends, with different terms and conditions than the original policy. The coverage will be issued without Evidence of Insurability on one of our current Portability forms.
<EOS>
Under Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, you can elect to continue 50%, 75%, or 100% of your ending life insurance amount (rounded to the nearest $1,000 multiple), but not exceeding $250,000. If you initially choose 50% or 75%, you cannot opt for more at a later date. The minimum continuable amount is $5,000. Portability is unavailable if you are inactive militarily or if you were previously ineligible or not covered under this provision. This policy does not extend portability for any life insurance amount that was initially ineligible to be covered.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, portability is not applicable for any life insurance amount being continued via conversion rights, waiver of premium provision, or continuation provisions within the policy. However, if only a portion of terminated coverage is elected for portability, or if the amount exceeds the maximum, then conversion rights may apply to the remaining amount. Notably, the waiver of premium provision is not available when electing portability coverage.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 74 rows [2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2], the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit is payable if an injury results in specified losses within 365 days of the accident date. The amount paid will be either the full Principal Sum or a portion thereof, as shown in the Schedule of Insurance. Proof of loss must be submitted for payment. The benefit adheres to the General Provisions of the Policy. Only one person will receive the entire Principal Sum for all losses caused by the same accident. Payments are made in accordance with the Proof of Loss provision, and no more than the Principal Sum will be paid per incident.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, the Seat Belt and Air Bag Benefit is payable when an injury results in a loss under the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit. The benefit is applicable if you were either a passenger wearing a seatbelt in a registered motor vehicle or its operator, as verified on the police accident report. The Seat Belt Benefit is the lesser of the Principal Sum multiplied by the Seat Belt Benefit Percentage or the Maximum Amount for this Benefit. Additionally, if you were in a seat equipped with an airbag and properly strapped in at the time of the airbag inflation, an Air Bag Benefit will also be paid, which is similarly calculated based on the Principal Sum and the Air Bag Benefit Percentage. A Minimum Benefit will be payable under the Seat Belt Benefit if it cannot be determined whether you were wearing a seatbelt at the time of the accident. Payments are made according to the Proof of Loss provision and General Provisions of The Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, an 'Accident' is defined as an unintentional collision of a Motor Vehicle where you were the passenger, provided that you were wearing a Seat Belt at the time of impact. This definition applies exclusively for this Benefit's purposes.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (pages 75, rows 2-3), an Air Bag is defined as an inflatable supplemental passive restraint system installed by a Motor Vehicle manufacturer that activates upon collision to safeguard individuals from injury and death. It's important to note that an Air Bag is distinct from a Seat Belt. The correct replacement parts for the Air Bag must be installed, adhering to the Motor Vehicle's manufacturer's specifications.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (pages 75 & 76, rows 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1), the Seat Belt in your vehicle or its manufacturer-specified replacements is essential for the Seat Belt and Air Bag Benefit. However, this benefit will not be payable if you are intoxicated or using drugs such as sedatives, narcotics, barbiturates, amphetamines, or hallucinogens at the time of injury, unless they were prescribed by or administered by a Physician. This provision applies when you are operating the Motor Vehicle.
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, intoxication or influence by alcohol or other substances is defined by the legal presumption of intoxication or impairment under the law of the state where an accident occurred. This involves a blood alcohol content (BAC) or results from testing methods that exceed the established limit. Such limits may be determined through various means of testing BAC or other substances in the context of the accident.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, if a policyholder experiences an injury resulting in death covered under the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit outside their permanent residence's territorial limits, a Repatriation Benefit will be paid. The benefit is claimable upon Proof of Loss submission and adherence to the Policy's general provisions. The Repatriation Benefit pays the least of: 1) actual burial/cremation preparation and transportation costs; 2) the product of the Principal Sum and the Repatriation Benefit Percentage; or 3) the Maximum Amount for this Benefit, as detailed in the Schedule of Insurance.

If proof is not given within the stipulated time but becomes impossible or if it is given as soon as possible, the claim will not be affected, but proof should be provided no later than one year afterwards, unless the beneficiary is not legally competent. The deadline may be extended for those who are incompetent.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (pages 77, rows 2-6), while a claim is pending, we have the right, at our expense, to arrange for the person who experienced a loss to undergo medical examinations by a Physician as often as we deem necessary. Additionally, in the event of death where it's not legally prohibited, we may request an autopsy. These procedures are intended to aid in claim assessment and resolution.
<EOS>
As per the Claim Payment section in Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (pages 77, rows 2-3), if benefits are determined to be payable, they will be issued within 30 days after receiving the Proof of Loss submission. The payment adheres to the Claims to be Paid provision, meaning it follows the specified terms and conditions without exceeding the stated amount.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (pages 77-78) outlines the beneficiaries for life insurance and accidental death benefits. If no named beneficiary survives, The Hartford may pay to the executors/administrators of the estate, surviving spouse, children, or parents. Additionally, up to $500 for burial expenses may be given to a person equitably entitled. Minor beneficiaries' shares are paid until a legal guardian is appointed, with initial payments of $200 and subsequent monthly installments not exceeding $200. Payments release The Hartford from further liability.

In the event of death, benefits can be deposited into a draft book account owned by either the policyholder or the beneficiary, with the owner having the option to receive a lump sum payment. However, no account will be established for a benefit payable to an estate. Any payments due to an estate, minor, or incompetent person may be paid up to $1,000 to a related individual entitled to it, fulfilling The Hartford's responsibility for the amount paid.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, you can designate or amend your beneficiary by submitting a written form acceptable to the Employer and filing it with them. Only valid forms received prior to your death will be accepted. The designation becomes effective on the date you signed and dated the form, regardless of any subsequent deaths. The insurance company is not responsible for payments made before being informed of a beneficiary change by the Employer. No changes in beneficiary can be made via Power of Attorney.
<EOS>
In the event of a claim denial for benefits as outlined in Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, both you and your beneficiary will receive written notification detailing the decision. This notification includes specific reasons for the denial referencing the relevant provisions, a description of any additional information needed to process the claim, an explanation of why this is essential, and a rundown of the review procedure.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, within specified timeframes, a claimant or their representative can appeal for a reevaluation of any claim denial.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, incontestability of the Life Insurance Benefit starts from its effective date and becomes non-contestable after two years. This provision excludes the Accidental Death and Dismemberment benefit(s). Any attempt to contest the insurance beyond the two-year period due to insurability statements requires those statements to be in writing, signed by you, and made after your insurance has been active for two years. Additionally, fraud is not applicable.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, you have the right to assign your rights and interest under the policy, including the ability to make required contributions, convert the insurance, and name or change a beneficiary. This assignment must be duly executed with a copy on file. The validity and effect of any assignment are not the responsibility of either party, nor are they obligated to provide assignees with notices. Collateral assignments are prohibited under this policy. Exceptions apply to dismemberment benefits under the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, legal action against the insurer can only be initiated: after a minimum waiting period of 60 days following Proof of Loss furnishing, or no later than 3 years from the date when Proof of Loss is required under The Policy. This timeframe safeguards the insurer from unnecessary litigation beyond these specified durations.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, page 79, row 2, The Policy does not replace or impact any Workers' Compensation coverage requirements. Concurrently, you are still obligated to maintain workers' compensation insurance as mandated by law.

Additionally, it is essential to note that The Policy is subject to the terms and conditions of the workers' compensation policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, insurance fraud is defined as providing false or misleading information during application or claims process with the intention of deceiving the company. This action is considered a crime, and the company reserves the right to employ various means for detection, investigation, deterrence, and prosecution of such offenders. Legal remedies will be pursued in case of fraudulent activities by the insured or employer.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 79, rows 2-6), any material facts about the policyholder not stated accurately may lead to adjustments in premium and a reassessment of coverage. The true facts will determine whether coverage should have been in force and if so, for what amount. This policy stipulates that if misstatements occur, the company reserves the right to alter the premium as necessary based on the correct information provided.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 80, row 1), the term 'Employer' refers explicitly to the Policyholder in this policy.

<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 86, rows 25-34 and 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 1), it is stated that a "Spouse" includes your legal partner or civil union partner if you meet certain conditions: either executing a domestic partner affidavit acceptable to the company, registering as domestic partners with a government agency where possible, and providing proof (unless prohibited by law). You must continue to fulfill these requirements to remain recognized as a domestic partner or civil union partner.

For Wisconsin residents, specific dollar amounts in the Conversion Right provision and the Claims to be Paid provision are adjusted to $5,000 and $1,000 respectively, if not already at those values. The policy and certificates otherwise remain unchanged. This document is signed for Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company.
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, dependent is defined as your spouse and any dependent child(ren). To be eligible, a person must be a U.S. citizen or resident of its territories/protectorates, excluding those in full-time military service unless they are later called to duty with the necessary premium paid. The age limit for children with disabilities under the Continuation for Dependent Children with Disabilities provision is extended to 21 if less than 21. A new addition to the Period of Coverage provisions states that:

- Coverage remains effective until the earlier of policy termination, death, or when the dependent becomes eligible for coverage under another group policy or reaches age 26, whichever comes first.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf detail pertains to reinstatement of coverage after military service (rows [13-43, 1-1]). If you enter active military service and are subsequently rehired within 12 months of your coverage termination or return from service, your prior coverage for you and your dependent spouse/dependents can be reinstated upon request within 31 days of returning to work. The reinstated coverage will maintain the same amounts as at the date of termination, be free from waiting periods, evidence of insurability, and pre-existing conditions limitations; however, it will adhere to the policy's terms.

The claims to be paid provision has been updated to allow for a portion of your life insurance benefit up to $500 to be paid to anyone equitably entitled due to funeral or illness-related expenses upon your death (row 42). The Seat Belt and Air Bag Benefit exclusion now applies if the injured person is intoxicated or under the influence of narcotics, unless advised by a physician (rows [19-20]).

For Massachusetts residents, the definition of terminal illness in the accelerated benefit cannot exceed 24 months. For Michigan residents, the policy interpretation provision has been deleted entirely. Additionally, for Minnesota residents, the term "granted military leave of absence" in the continuation section has been modified (rows [36-37]).
<EOS>
In Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, under Provisions section, a military leave of absence is documented. The original "Lay Off" provision from the Continuation Provisions has been deleted and replaced with this new term. This means that during an employee's military service, their coverage can be temporarily paused without causing layoff status. However, upon return from military duty, the employee must meet certain eligibility criteria to resume coverage under the policy. The document does not specify the exact duration of the military leave or any specific eligibility requirements for reinstatement.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf section on Lay Off (pages 82, 83) outlines the option to continue coverage if you are terminated or laid off. You have 60 days from either your coverage termination date or the written notice of your right to continue coverage to elect this continued coverage. The premium charged cannot exceed 102% of the premium paid for life insurance coverage for an active employee.

Your employer will inform you of your rights, the monthly premium amount, and payment methods. Upon request, they will provide a written verification of the cost of coverage. Coverage continues until the first of either you being covered under another group policy or the 18th month following termination/layoff. At the end of this period, you may convert to reduced benefits coverage or accept a policy with 83 reduced benefits at a lower premium rate.

Minnesota law stipulates that if your coverage ends due to employer non-compliance regarding notice or premium payment, they will be liable for benefit payments up to the extent we would have been. A lay off is defined as a reduction in hours making you ineligible for coverage, excluding discharge for gross misconduct but including retirement.

Additionally, the 7th paragraph of the Accelerated Benefit provision is deleted, as well as the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th paragraphs of the Conversion Right provision. The 5th paragraph of the Claims to be Paid provision's first sentence is amended to allow for payment into a draft book account (checking account) if benefits exceed $15,000. For Missouri residents, specific time periods in the Conditions for Qualification and the Benefit Payable before Approval of Benefits sections are not detailed.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, under the 180-day Waiver of Premium provision (rows 4-9 on page 83), if a disability claim is approved with Waiver of Premium, it will be effective from the start of your disability, following a 180-day waiting period. Notably, the Suicide provision has been replaced with new language.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 83, rows [11-16, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]) outlines suicide-related coverage provisions. If death is due to suicide (sane or insane), no Supplemental Amount of Life Insurance or Dependent Life Insurance will be paid for a person who elected coverage within one year prior to their death, regardless of whether it's initial or increased coverage, except for benefit increases resulting solely from increased earnings. If death occurs due to suicide within one year of the policy effective date, all premiums are refunded. This time frame includes group life insurance coverage under the Prior Policy.

Regarding Accidental Death and Dismemberment benefits, suicide or attempted suicide (sane or insane) is added as an exclusion. For Montana residents, the Conversion Right period is extended to 3 years if greater than that, and the maximum amount is set at $10,000 if less. The second paragraph of the Conversion Policy Provisions is deleted for these residents, and the dollar amount in the Claims to be Paid provision is increased to $500 if it was not already at that amount; furthermore, a provision excluding suicide or attempted suicide from the Claims to be Paid provision is added.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf outlines several aspects of a life insurance policy. Death claims will be paid within 60 days of proof submission, with interest accrued if payment is made more than 30 days later, at the discount rate of 90-day commercial paper effective on the proof due date. For New Hampshire residents, certain provisions like Waiver of Premium and Disability Extension are deleted, while changes are made to the Conversion provision regarding notice timing and acceptance requirements. The Sending Proof of Loss section has an item deleted, and the dollar amount stated in the Claims to be Paid section may be $250 or another specified amount. Additionally, if Spouse Accidental Death and Dismemberment is included in the contract, there's a stipulation regarding the period of coverage.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf document, if you are separated or divorced from your spouse, their coverage may continue under this policy for up to three years following the divorce anniversary, unless you remarry, they remarry, a specified date is mentioned in the divorce decree, they fail to pay premiums, or you die. Noteworthy exceptions apply to residents of North Dakota and Ohio, with additional provisions regarding suicide coverage and accelerated death benefit amendments. For Oregon residents, the spouse definition is also amended.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf passage from pages [84, 85] details key provisions regarding the definition of 'Spouse' and 'Dependent Child(ren)'. A Spouse is an individual under age 65, not legally separated or divorced, and not in active full-time military service outside specific areas, but active service within those areas qualifies as a Dependent. Domestic partners can also be considered Spouses if certain affidavits are executed or registration is made with relevant government agencies. A Spouse's status continues so long as they meet legal requirements or the terms of the domestic partner affidavit.

Dependent Child(ren) now include children of an Oregon registered domestic partner.
