However, your payment will be the lesser of: a.  the monthly benefit that would have been payable under the terms of the prior plan if it had remained inforce; or b.  the monthly payment under the Unum plan. Your benefits will end on the earlier of the following dates: 1.  the end of the maximum benefit period under the plan; or 2.  the date benefits would have ended under the prior plan if it had remained in force. HOW CAN UNUM'S REHABILITATION AND RETURN TO WORK ASSISTANCE PROGRAM HELP YOU RETURN TO WORK? Unum has a vocational Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program available to assist you in returning to work.  We will determine whether you are eligible for this program, at our sole discretion.  In order to be eligible for rehabilitation services and benefits, you must be medically able to engage in a return to work program. Your claim file will be reviewed by one of Unum's rehabilitation professionals to determine if a rehabilitation program might help you return to gainful employment. As your file is reviewed, medical and vocational information will be analyzed to determine an appropriate return to work program. We will make the final determination of your eligibility for participation in the program.",

Retirement Plan includes but is not limited to any plan which is part of any federal, state, county, municipal or association retirement system. SALARY CONTINUATION OR ACCUMULATED SICK LEAVE  means continued payments to you by your Employer of all or part of your monthly earnings, after you become disabled as defined by the Policy.  This continued payment must be part of an established plan maintained by your Employer for the benefit of all employees covered under the Policy.

Such compensation is considered disability earnings, and would be taken into account in calculating your monthly payment. SELF-REPORTED SYMPTOMS  means the manifestations of your condition which you tell your physician, that are not verifiable using tests, procedures or clinical examinations standardly accepted in the practice of medicine. Examples of self-reported symptoms include, but are not limited to headaches, pain, fatigue, stiffness, soreness, ringing in ears, dizziness, numbness and loss of energy.",

If you are confined to a  hospital or institution  at the end of the 24 month period, Unum will continue to send you payments during your confinement. If you are still disabled when you are discharged, Unum will send you payments for a recovery period of up to 90 days. If you become reconfined at any time during the recovery period and remain confined for at least 14 days in a row, Unum will send payments during that additional confinement and for one additional recovery period up to 90 more days. 2.  In addition to Item 1, if, after the 24 month period for which you have received payments, you continue to be disabled and subsequently become confined to a hospital or institution for at least 14 days in a row, Unum will send payments during the length of the reconfinement.
