After this period, disability is determined by inability to perform any occupation matching the employee's training, education, or experience.\n\nThe policy includes an Elimination Period during which benefits are not paid. The Maximum Benefit Period sets a limit on how long benefits can be received. Loss of professional licenses does not constitute Total Disability. The insured employee can choose not to engage in Partial Disability Employment during this period, and partial benefits will still be paid for any part of the month.\n\nThe policy applies to full-time employees working at least 30 hours per week who become eligible upon starting active employment.
