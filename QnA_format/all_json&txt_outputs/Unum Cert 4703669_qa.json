This is your certificate of coverage as long as you are eligible for coverage and you become insured.  You will want to read it carefully and keep it in a safe place. Unum has written your certificate of coverage in plain English.  However, a few terms and provisions are written as required by insurance law.  If you have any questions about any of the terms and provisions, please consult Unum's claims paying office.  Unum will assist you in any way to help you understand your benefits. If the terms and provisions of the certificate of coverage (issued to you) are different from the policy (issued to the policyholder), the policy will govern.  Your coverage may be cancelled or changed in whole or in part under the terms and provisions of the policy. The policy is delivered in and is governed by the laws of the governing jurisdiction and to the extent applicable by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and any amendments. When making a benefit determination under the policy, Unum has discretionary authority to determine your eligibility for benefits and to interpret the terms and provisions of the policy.

For physicians, \"regular occupation\" means the general or sub-specialty in which you are practicing when your disability begins and for which you are certified by the American Board of Medical Specialties.  If the sub-specialty in which you are practicing is not recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties, you will be considered practicing in the general specialty category. For all other employees, your regular occupation means the material and substantial occupational duties as recognized in the general workplace, that you were routinely performing prior to becoming disabled. Unum will look at your occupation as it is normally performed in the national economy, instead of how the work tasks are performed for a specific employer or at a specific location. RETIREMENT PLAN  means a defined contribution plan or defined benefit plan.  These are plans which provide retirement benefits to employees and are not funded entirely by employee contributions. Retirement Plan includes but is not limited to any plan which is part of any federal, state, county, municipal or association retirement system. SALARY CONTINUATION OR ACCUMULATED SICK LEAVE  means continued payments to you by your Employer of all or part of your monthly earnings, after you become disabled as defined by the Policy.  This continued payment must be part of an established plan maintained by your Employer for the benefit of all employees covered under the Policy.  Salary continuation or accumulated sick leave does not include compensation paid to you by your Employer for work you actually perform after your disability begins.  Such compensation is considered disability earnings, and would be taken into account in calculating your monthly payment. SELF-REPORTED SYMPTOMS  means the manifestations of your condition which you tell your physician, that are not verifiable using tests, procedures or clinical examinations standardly accepted in the practice of medicine. Examples of self-reported symptoms include, but are not limited to headaches, pain, fatigue, stiffness, soreness, ringing in ears, dizziness, numbness and loss of energy. SICKNESS  means an illness or disease.  Disability must begin while you are covered under the plan. SURVIVOR, ELIGIBLE  means your spouse, if living; otherwise your children under age 25 equally. WAITING PERIOD  means the continuous period of time (shown in each plan) that you must be in active employment in an eligible group before you are eligible for coverage under a plan. WE,  US  and  OUR  means Unum Life Insurance Company of America. YOU  means an employee who is eligible for Unum coverage.",

Examples of self-reported symptoms include, but are not limited to headaches, pain, fatigue, stiffness, soreness, ringing in ears, dizziness, numbness and loss of energy. SICKNESS  means an illness or disease.  Disability must begin while you are covered under the plan. SURVIVOR, ELIGIBLE  means your spouse, if living; otherwise your children under age 25 equally.
