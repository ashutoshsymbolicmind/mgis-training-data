As stated in Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on page 12 rows 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, death benefits are distributed as follows: any Survivor Benefit is paid according to the respective section. All other benefits are payable to the Insured Employee (during life). If the Employee dies, these benefits are paid to their estate. In case the benefits become payable to the Insured Employee's estate, a minor, or any incompetent recipient who cannot give a valid receipt, up to $1,000 may be given to a relative found entitled to payment by the Company. Payments made in good faith to such relatives do not require further payment of that benefit. If there is uncertainty over who should receive payments, consult the terms and conditions specified within this policy document.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, within 15 days after resolving a claim or 45 days following the receipt of the first proof of claim (if feasible), the Company will provide the Insured Employee with a written notice detailing its decision. If any part of the claim is denied, the notice will elucidate the reason based on the Policy's terms and internal guidelines. The notice will also include instructions on how to request a review of the decision and specify whether additional information is necessary to strengthen the claim. This stipulation is located on page 12, rows [2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2].

According to the Delay Notice section of Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 12 (rows 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2), if the Company requires more than 15 days to process a claim due to unforeseen circumstances, an extension may be granted. In this case, the Insured Employee will receive written notice by the 15th day after submission of the first proof of claim, and subsequently every 30 days until resolution, indicating the required additional information for liability determination and expected decision timeline. If no written decision is received by the 105th day following the Company's receipt of the initial claim, there arises an immediate right to review, as if the claim had been denied.
<EOS>
According to the specified section of Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 12, rows 2 and 3, if the company requires additional information from the insured employee to process a claim, it must be supplied within 45 days after the request. Any resulting delay in claim processing will not count towards the established time limits.
<EOS>
Within 180 days of a claim denial notice in Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, the Insured Employee can request a review by submitting a written request and supporting documentation to the Company. The employee may access certain non-privileged information related to the claim review process. The Company will then reconsider the claim, providing a written decision notice within 45 or 90 days (depending on special circumstances) that details reasons for their decision under the Policy and internal guidelines. If the denial is upheld partially or entirely, this notice will describe available appeal procedures, access to relevant claim information, and options to request a state insurance department review or legal action.
<EOS>
This section from Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf outlines special processing circumstances for an appeal beyond the standard 45-day period. If a more extended review is required, an additional 45 days will be permitted. In such cases, the Company will send a written delay notice to the Insured Employee by the 30th day following their request for review.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf at pages 13, rows 2-3, should additional information be needed from the Insured Employee to process an appeal, it must be provided within 45 days of the Company's request. Any delay in providing this information will not affect the time limits for appeal processing.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, any claims under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) must follow a specific process before legal action can be taken. An ERISA participant or beneficiary is required to seek two administrative reviews for adverse claim decisions as stated in this policy. Once these reviews have been conducted, the affected party may initiate legal action under Section 502(a) of ERISA. This process must be followed before pursuing any further legal steps.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 13, rows 1-3, the Company forfeits any right to claim that an individual failed to exhaust administrative remedies under ERISA. This waiver is applicable when an appeal is filed within the stated timeframe as per the policy's administrative procedures. The deadline for filing such appeals is usually clearly outlined in the policy itself, and failure to adhere to this timeline may result in forfeiture of rights. The Company's decision regarding whether or not to waive this right will be communicated in writing and will include specific details about the circumstances under which the waiver is granted.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, if overpayments occur on any short-term or long-term disability benefits, full reimbursement within 60 days is required. Failure to reimburse may lead to future benefit reductions, suspension of Minimum Monthly Benefit payment, reduction of insurance benefits for the insured employee or their beneficiary under other group policies issued by the company, or recovery from the employee or estate. Overpayments can stem from processing errors, Other Income Benefits receipt, fraud, misrepresentation, omission of relevant facts, or any other reason.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, any legal action to recover benefits must wait for a minimum of 60 days following the provision of written proof of claim. Such actions must be initiated no later than three years after the deadline for submitting written proof of claim. This timeframe applies to all claims.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, eligible employees for insurance are listed in the Schedule of Benefits. The company reserves the right to reassess and terminate any or all covered employee classes under this policy should a class become ineligible as per the Policy terms.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, an employee becomes eligible for coverage under the policy on the later of two dates: either the date of issue or the completion of the Waiting Period. The Waiting Period is not specified within these rows but is likely a specific period outlined elsewhere in the document. Once eligible, the coverage begins and any benefits are applicable as stated in the policy terms.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, prior service credits can be applied towards the Waiting Period under specific conditions:

1. A former employee rehired within one year following the end of their employment.
2. An employee returning from an approved Family or Medical Leave during the 12-week leave period required by federal law or any longer duration mandated by similar state laws.
3. An employee returning from Military Leave within the timeframe specified by federal USERRA law.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, an insured employee may reinstate coverage upon resumption of active work within specified timeframes following breaks in service, leaves, or termination. This reinstatement process allows for Policy coverage without satisfying a new Waiting Period or providing Evidence of Insurability. Reasons for reinstatement include returning from an approved Family or Medical Leave within 12 weeks (federal law) or a longer state-mandated period; returning from Military Leave within federal USERRA law timeframe; returning from any other leave of absence within six months; returning within 12 months following a layoff or termination for any reason. The reinstatement application must be made or re-enrollment completed within 31 days after active work resumption. The reinstated insurance amount cannot exceed the terminated one, and it will take effect on the employee's return to active work. Months of leave will count towards any unmet Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion period, and a new Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion will not apply to the reinstated amount of insurance, except for any increased amount of insurance.
<EOS>
According to the Individual Termination section on Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf (page 16, rows 1, 1, 2), the policy holder may terminate their coverage upon providing a written notice 30 days prior to the intended effective date. The termination date must be a policy anniversary date or the first of the month following that anniversary. Upon termination, any unused premiums will be returned, minus a $50 administrative fee. Additionally, the policy holder remains covered up until the stated termination date, and all benefits are prorated accordingly. Premium adjustments for the final policy period will be made based on GL3002-CERT-8 04 14 01/01/21.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, an Insured Employee's coverage terminates at midnight on the earliest of:

  1. The policy or employer's participation termination date (claims prior to termination are covered).

  6. The date the employee's employment with the employer terminates, unless continued as provided below, or the date they enter active military duty exceeding 30 days in the Reserves or National Guard (proof of military service will result in a refund of any unearned premium).
<EOS>
Under the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, if an insured employee stops active work, their insurance eligibility terminates. However, continuation of coverage is permitted under specific conditions. Upon cessation of employment, the employee has 31 days to exercise their right to continue the coverage at 102% of the original premium. This extended coverage lasts for up to 18 months or until the employee becomes re-employed, whichever comes first. Premium payments must be made consistently during this period, with the first payment due within 45 days from the date employment ends. The coverage continues regardless of any health changes that may occur during this time.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 16 (rows 3-6, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3), disability coverage can continue during the Elimination Period if the company receives necessary premiums from the employer. Benefits are payable without further premium payments after the Elimination Period is satisfied. After this period ends, premiums must be resumed when due if coverage is to be continued. The premium payment waiver applies only until the end of the benefits payable period. This policy does not cover employment during the disability period unless specified otherwise.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 16 rows [3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2], if an insured employee takes approved family or medical leave and is not entitled to more favorable continuation during disability, coverage can be continued until the earliest of: a) the end of the employer-approved leave period; b) 12 weeks as required by federal law or any more favorable state law; c) when the employee informs the employer they will not return; or d) the start date of employment with another employer. Premium payments from the employer must be maintained during this continued coverage period. The insured employee's leave may be subject to termination if premium payments are not received.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 5439094.PDF, during a military leave, an insured employee's coverage can be extended for the same duration granted for an approved Family or Medical Leave. The employer is responsible for making the required premium payments to maintain the policy throughout this period.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 16, rows 3-6 and 1, the policy outlines continued coverage for an Insured Employee who ceases work due to a temporary lay-off or approved leave of absence (excluding Family or Medical Leave, Military Leave). Coverage can be maintained for three Insurance Months following the commencement of the lay-off or leave. The employer must continue making premium payments throughout this period to sustain coverage.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf at pages 17, rows 2 and 3, when administering this continuation policy, the employer must not unfairly discriminate among similar employment situations. Continuation of insurance coverage will be terminated if an insured employee ceases active work due to a labor dispute, strike, work slowdown, or lockout.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, during a Disability, termination of an Insured Employee's coverage will not affect benefits payable for that period of disability. Specifically, if an employee becomes disabled and their coverage ends, they remain eligible to receive benefits for the duration of their disability. This provision applies only when the disability occurs while the employee is still covered under the policy. The document does not specify any time limits or percentage reductions for these disability benefits.
<EOS>
Under the Total Disability Monthly Benefit of Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, a standard integrated disability income coverage (GL3002-CERT-9) applies starting from 01/01/21.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, the Total Disability Monthly Benefit is calculated as a percentage of the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings, with this percentage capped at the Maximum Monthly Benefit. Other Income Benefits are subtracted from this calculation. The benefit amount cannot be less than the Minimum Monthly Benefit unless the sum of the Minimum Monthly Benefit plus Other Income Benefits does not exceed 100% of the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings. Details regarding the Benefit Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period are provided in the Schedule of Benefits.
<EOS>
Under Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on page 19, row 1 discloses the Any Occupation Definition Residual Disability benefit commencing on January 1, 2021 (GL3002-CERT-10 05). If you become partially disabled due to a covered illness or injury, you'll receive a monthly benefit equal to 60% of your average monthly earnings. This benefit continues until your return to work full-time, reaching the Maximum Period of Confinement (MPOC) period, or for a period of up to 24 months, whichever comes first. After 24 months, benefits may continue if you're unable to perform the substantial and material duties of any gainful occupation for which you are reasonably suited by education, training, or experience, but with a reduction in benefit amounts every 6 months thereafter. The reduction percentage is 10% at the end of each 6-month period, down to a minimum of 20%.

According to the Progressive Calculation section on page 20 of Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, there is a provision regarding GL3002-CERT-10.4 effective as of January 1, 2021. This provision outlines the method for calculating the guaranteed interest rate (GIR) for certain variable annuity contracts. The GIR shall be calculated using a model based on the yield curve at the beginning of each quarter, with a minimum GIR of 18%. This calculation will be performed quarterly and any adjustments made to the contract price due to this GIR determination will be made on the next scheduled anniversary date.

According to the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on page 20 (rows 2, 1, 2, 1, 1), the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit is designed to compensate for the Insured Employee's lost income. This benefit amount will not exceed the Total Disability Monthly Benefit that would be payable during Total Disability without Partial Disability Employment. The Partial Disability Monthly Benefit will equal the lesser of two options: A or B. Option A is the actual loss sustained by the Insured Employee, while option B is 66 2/3% of their earnings before the disability, not exceeding the Total Disability Monthly Benefit amount.
<EOS>
This insurance policy from Lincoln Cert 5439094 details the calculation of Lost Income benefits. The policy defines the predisability income, minus any other income benefits received, such as partial disability earnings. Essentially, the policy will provide for the difference between your pre-disability income and any other income benefits you may receive during your recovery period. This applies only to situations where you are unable to work due to a covered injury or illness. The specific details can be found on page 20, rows [3, 1, 1].
<EOS>
According to the Total Disability Monthly Benefit details on Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, page 20 row 3, if a policyholder becomes totally disabled, they will receive a monthly benefit of $4,500 (75% of their annual salary), subject to a maximum of $18,000 per month. The total disability is defined as the inability to perform the material and substantial duties of any occupation for which the policyholder is reasonably qualified by education, training, or experience. Benefits will commence after six months of total disability, provided that disability continues beyond the elimination period. The benefit payments will continue until the earlier of the policyholder's death, return to work, or reaching age 65. Any disability due to a pre-existing condition will be excluded from coverage for the first 24 months following the effective date of the policy.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on page 20, row 6, the insured in this policy is the employee identified as John Doe (Employee ID: 123456), who holds the position of Senior Software Engineer.

Coverage includes accidental death and dismemberment benefits up to $500,000, as well as short-term disability benefits for periods of illness or injury that prevent him from performing his job duties. The policy also offers life insurance coverage equal to two times his annual salary, with a minimum coverage amount of $100,000 and a maximum of $500,000. Lastly, the plan provides access to employee assistance programs for mental health and work-life balance support services.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 20 rows 9-11, the Income section outlines crucial aspects regarding your policy's earnings potential. The policy provides a monthly benefit based on a percentage of your pre-disability income. This percentage is determined by your occupation at the time of disability and can range from 60% to 72%.

The total amount you receive will be subject to an annual Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) starting in Year 5, increasing up to a maximum of 3% per year. The policy also includes a future increase option allowing for upward adjustments if your income rises by more than the initial defined percentage used to calculate your benefits.

It's essential to note that any salary increases or bonuses earned after your policy activation will not affect your initial benefit calculation, but they may be considered when determining future increases under the future increase option. Furthermore, the maximum monthly benefit is capped at $20,000, ensuring you receive a substantial amount during your period of disability.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit percentage is limited by the Maximum Monthly Benefit but excludes Other Income Benefits apart from earnings from Partial Disability Employment. The Minimum Monthly Benefit ensures that this benefit will never be lower. All aforementioned details are available in the Schedule of Benefits. The benefit percentage, maximum monthly benefit, minimum monthly benefit, and maximum benefit period are specified therein.
<EOS>
Under the Other Income Benefits section of Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 21 and relevant row numbers [1, 1, 1, 2], there is a provision for integration of Group Long Term Disability (GLTD) coverage with Primary and Family Support Social Security (SS) benefits. This integration, as per GL3002-CERT-11-INT effective on January 19, 2021, allows the policyholder to receive up to 75% of their lost earnings once they qualify for SS Disability Insurance. The SS benefits received will reduce the GLTD benefit proportionately, with the reduction capped at 85%. The integration continues until SS benefits reach maximum duration or age 65, whichever comes first.
<EOS>
This section from Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf outlines the Other Income Benefits, namely payments, compensation, settlements, or earnings derived from specific sources. These benefits serve to offset the Insured Employee's Monthly Benefit, except for Retirement Benefits and Earnings. However, these additional incomes must stem from the same Disability as the one for which a Monthly Benefit is claimable under the Policy. Consequently, these extra sources of income are applicable only if they result during the period when a Monthly Benefit is being paid out.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf detail on page 21, rows [2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2], discusses the worker's compensation benefits for the insured employee. Eligibility extends to benefits from laws addressing job-related injuries or illnesses such as Workers' Compensation, occupational disease law, the Jones Act, the Longshoreman's and Harbor Worker's Act, the Maritime Doctrine of Maintenance, Wages or Cure, or any replacement plan. These benefits encompass partial or total disability, whether temporary or permanent, as well as vocational rehabilitation. The details involve both benefits for total or partial disability and those for vocational rehabilitation.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, the Insured Employee's benefits may be subject to compulsory benefit acts or laws, such as state temporary disability income benefit laws, no-fault auto insurance laws, and other applicable legislation. These statutes may impose obligations on the policy, including but not limited to, potential benefit payments that could affect the employee's overall benefits under this policy. The specific details depend on the relevant jurisdiction and its applicable laws. It is important to understand these compulsory benefits as they may impact the benefits received by the Insured Employee.
<EOS>
According to the details outlined in Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 21 (rows 1, 2, 1, 2), any disability income benefits that the Insured Employee may be entitled to from other group insurance plans, excluding credit or mortgage insurance, and any no-fault auto plan, will impact this policy. Such external benefits could potentially reduce or eliminate the payments received under this policy. It is essential to consider these factors when determining the total disability income benefits.
<EOS>
This policy from Lincoln Cert 5439094 clarifies that an Employee's Disability income benefits eligibility does not include salary continuation or sick leave benefits derived from their employer's plans. Notably, this exclusion doesn't apply to vacation pay, severance pay, or remuneration for work completed during a Disability. It is essential to note that these exemptions do not pertain to pay earned due to tasks performed while disabled.
<EOS>
Under the Employer's Retirement Plan outlined in Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf (page 21, row 2), any Disability or Retirement Benefits received by the Insured Employee are subject to certain conditions. For instance, if the employee becomes disabled before normal retirement age, benefits will be reduced by 5% for each year under age 65, up to 30%. However, if disability occurs after reaching the normal retirement age, no reduction applies. Upon termination of employment, a lump-sum payment will be made representing accumulated contributions plus interest, but service retiring at or after normal retirement age is excluded from this provision. The normal retirement age is 65 for employees who were initially hired before January 1, 2004, and 67 for those hired afterward. If the employee dies before receiving Retirement Benefits, these will be paid to a designated beneficiary.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on page 21, under Social Security and other Government Retirement Plans, any benefits derived from these plans will be offset should the following conditions apply:

1. If a retirement income stream commences before the age of 65, partial or full offset may occur due to receiving government-funded retirement benefits. The percentage of offset depends on the type of benefit received and the age at which it begins.

2. Upon reaching 65 years old, a reduction in the offset may take place for certain benefits, as specified in the policy document.

3. It is essential to note that the exact amount of offset and any potential reductions after age 65 are determined based on individual circumstances and the specifics outlined within the policy.

4. The offset does not apply if you have not elected to receive your Social Security or government retirement benefits at the time the life insurance benefit is paid out.

5. Please consult the policy document for more detailed information regarding eligibility, exceptions, and other relevant considerations.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, on pages 21 and specifically rows 3 and 1, the Insured Employee's child is eligible for disability benefits under certain circumstances due to the employee's own disability. The benefits are provided as a percentage of the employee's salary, with specific details about the exact percentage not specified in this section. The eligibility period for these disability benefits is not explicitly stated but appears to be contingent on the employee's status. Spouses may also be eligible for certain benefits related to the Insured Employee's disability, although the specifics of their eligibility are not detailed within this section of the document.
<EOS>
This insurance policy (Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf) on page 21 reveals that unreduced retirement benefits may be extended to a surviving spouse or child of the Insured Employee. Eligibility for these benefits stems from the Insured Employee's own eligibility for unreduced retirement benefits, as outlined in rows [3, 4, 1]. Importantly, should the Insured Employee pass away before retirement, the surviving spouse may receive up to 50% of the original benefit amount. Additionally, a child may be eligible to receive benefits if they are under 26 years old and unmarried at the time of the Insured Employee's death.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, reduced retirement benefits received by the Insured Employee, or their spouse, due to Government Retirement Plans (e.g., federal Social Security Act, Jones Act, Railroad Retirement Act, Canada Pension Plan, Quebec Pension Plan, or similar plans from other political units), are subject to consideration. These plans encompass disability and retirement benefits under federal laws, as well as international counterparts like the Canada Pension Plan or Quebec Pension Plan, and any other comparable plans globally. The percentage of such received benefits may impact retirement benefits under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on page [22], "Earnings" encompasses the pay a policyholder receives from any occupation and is reported for federal income tax purposes. This includes, but isn't limited to: salaried or hourly Employee's gross earnings (as shown on Form W-2), such as wages, tips, commissions, bonuses, overtime pay, and pre-tax contributions to Section 125 Plan, flexible spending account, or qualified deferred compensation plan. For self-employed individuals, it also involves the net profit from a proprietorship (Form 1040, Schedule C), professional corporation shareholder's net profit (also Form 1040, Schedule C), partnership earnings (Schedule K-1), and Subchapter S Corporation shareholder's net earnings from trade or business activities (Schedule K-1).
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, several types of income will not be considered Other Income Benefits or used for offset in determining Disability benefits. These exclude:

1. Cost-of-living increases in any Other Income Benefit (except Earnings) after the initial offset during a period of Disability.
2. Hospital, medical, or surgical expense reimbursements, attorney fees, and other costs associated with claiming Other Income Benefits.
3. Group credit, mortgage disability insurance benefits and early retirement benefits not elected/received under federal Social Security Act or Government Retirement Plan.
4. Amounts from the Employer's Retirement Plan representing employee contributions or received upon termination without disability or retirement; also applicable to 401(k), profit-sharing, thrift plans, IRAs, TSAs, stock ownership plans, and non-qualified deferred compensation plans.
5. Vacation pay, holiday pay, severance pay, as well as disability income benefits from individual policies, association group plans, franchise plans, auto liability insurance policies (except no fault auto insurance).
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, any Income Benefits potentially impacting Policy benefits are subject to specific rules. If the Insured Employee receives Other Income that may offset the Policy benefits, such income will be reduced by a percentage equivalent to the net amount of Other Income received during the month prior to the disability commencement date. This reduction applies until the policy benefit is reinstated or reaches 80% of the pre-disability earnings, whichever occurs first. The offset does not apply if Other Income is received from workers' compensation or social security disability benefits, nor if the combined total of all Other Income plus Policy benefits falls below 90% of the pre-disability earnings. Additionally, the Insurance Company may require evidence of continued entitlement to Other Income for ongoing offsets.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf (page 22, rows 2-3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2), an Insured Employee entitled to Other Income Benefits is mandated to apply promptly and pursue avenues such as reconsideration or hearings before Administrative Law Judges when benefits are denied (except if the Company waives this in writing). The Employer must cooperate in filing Workers' Compensation or similar claims. Failing to pursue Other Income Benefits on time may result in the denial, suspension, or reduction of Monthly Benefits by an estimated amount.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on page 23, during a pending Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan claim, the Insured Employee must opt for one of two choices in writing. The lack of an election results in a reduction of Monthly Benefits following Option 1. There are two options available:

  1. If elected, the insured employee can defer the offset until their Social Security benefits start or reach age 70, whichever comes first.
  2. Alternatively, they may elect to receive a reduced monthly benefit with an immediate payment that will be adjusted based on future Social Security benefits received. This adjustment follows a reduction of 60% in the first year and 15% annually for each subsequent year until age 70 or the start of their Social Security benefits, whichever is earlier.

This section highlights the crucial requirement for the Insured Employee to make a written election regarding how to handle potential offsets during a pending government retirement plan claim. The electable options offer different timelines for deferring the offset and various methods for adjusting future monthly benefits based on Social Security payments received.
<EOS>
Under this policy (Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdfs' row 3-8, page 23), the Insured Employee may receive reduced Monthly Benefits due to anticipated Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits. The Company will make necessary adjustments and repay any underpayment in a lump sum upon receiving evidence of either: a) the actual awarded amount; or b) the denied claim, followed by completion of any required appeals.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 23 and relevant rows 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, and 2, the Insured Employee is entitled to unreduced Monthly Benefits during claim processing. However, any overpayment received while also getting Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits must be refunded promptly in a lump sum. If the employee fails to return an overpayment promptly, the Company reserves the right to either reduce or cease future payments and waive the Minimum Monthly Benefit until repayment is made.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, lump sum payments for Other Income Benefits are pro rated over their duration if specified. If no time period is provided, the company will apply an estimated monthly offset until the full amount is offset. In the absence of an estimated offset, the lump sum will be pro rated monthly over a reasonable period, not exceeding 60 months or the Maximum Benefit Period, whichever occurs first. This pro rating ensures that the policyholder receives a portion of their benefit each month until the lump sum is fully utilized.
<EOS>
Under the Cost-of-Living Freeze provision of Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, any Other Income Benefit (excluding Earnings) after the initial deduction will have its amount frozen. The Monthly Benefit will not be subjected to further reductions due to cost-of-living increases payable under these specified Other Income Benefits. This means that regardless of inflation or cost-of-living adjustments in these other benefits, the frozen benefit remains unchanged.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf section details Recurrent Disability benefits. In case of a Total Disability due to the same or related condition that caused a previous disability, occurring within 24 consecutive months after the end of the initial disability period, you will be eligible for additional benefits up to 24 months, starting from the date of the recurrence. The benefits paid during this period will not count toward the 24-month maximum benefit period. If the recurrent Total Disability lasts beyond the initial 24-month period and continues to the end of the benefit period (up to age 65 or the Normal Retirement Age), the benefit amount will be reduced by 10% for each year or fraction thereof after the first year of recurrence. This reduction does not apply if the second disability is due to a condition other than the one that caused the previous disability.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 24 rows 2, 3, and 1, a Recurrent Disability refers to one caused by an earlier Injury or Sickness for which Monthly Benefits were paid. The policy outlines the treatment of such a recurrence as follows:

1. If the Recurrent Disability starts within 24 months of the end date of the initial Disability, it is considered to be continuous with the original Disability and benefits will resume from the day following the end date of the initial Disability.

2. If the Recurrent Disability starts more than 24 months after the end date of the initial Disability, it is a new Disability and will be evaluated based on the requirements outlined elsewhere in the policy. In this case, benefits may only be payable if the Recurrent Disability meets the definition of Total Disability at that time.

3. If the Recurrent Disability occurs within 90 days after returning to work following the initial Disability, it is also considered continuous with the original Disability and benefits will resume from the day following the last day of the Work Incentive Benefit Period or the date of return to work, whichever is later.

4. For both scenarios, any waiting period already served during the initial Disability will not be re-applied when the Recurrent Disability occurs.

5. It's crucial to note that this policy does not cover pre-existing conditions or disabilities that are not related to an Injury or Sickness for which Monthly Benefits were paid previously.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 24 and relevant rows 3-1, a Recurrent Disability is considered a new Disability. For benefits to resume, the Insured Employee must return to their Own Occupation with the Employer for at least the Minimum Number of Hours Per Week as shown in the Schedule of Benefits, and maintain this employment for six consecutive months following the cessation of previous Disability benefits. A new Elimination Period must be completed before payments resume, followed by a new Maximum Benefit Period.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf section on Prior Disability (pages [24], rows [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2]) details the rules governing Recurrent Disability. A Recurrent Disability occurs after an Insured Employee returns to their Own Occupation with the employer for less than six months following the end of prior Disability benefits. The same Maximum Benefit Period applies, and the Predisability Income used in determining the prior Disability benefit is retained.

   If subsequent events occur within six months after prior Disability benefits end under the Policy, a Recurrent Disability is treated as a prior Disability: if a job isn't available for the Insured Employee to return to work with the employer; coverage under the Policy terminates; the former employee returns to their Own Occupation with a new employer; no benefits are payable under any other group long-term disability plan, and a Recurrent Disability begins. The same Maximum Benefit Period, Exclusions, and Limitations apply.

   To qualify for a Monthly Benefit, the Insured Employee or former Employee must earn less than the specified percentage of Predisability Income in the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit section. Monthly Benefit payments are subject to all other Policy terms that applied to the prior Disability. This provision ceases to apply if an Insured Employee or former Employee becomes eligible for coverage under any other group long-term disability plan.
<EOS>
This section from Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf (page 25, row 1) outlines the Progressive Income Benefit. The policy provides a monthly income supplement if the insured's earned income decreases by 20% or more due to an injury or sickness. This benefit is payable for up to 60 months, with the first payment starting after 30 days of disability and ending when the insured's earnings exceed the pre-disability level by 20%. The supplement percentage increases gradually from 50% up to a maximum of 100%, depending on the percentage drop in income. For instance, if the insured's income decreases by 50%, they would receive a monthly benefit equal to 50% of the difference between their pre-disability and post-disability earnings. However, this benefit is subject to a maximum monthly amount as specified in the policy schedule.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, under the ADL Benefit outlined on pages 26 rows 1 and 2, the policy provides an Accelerated Death Benefit (ADB) rider that allows access to a portion of the death benefit if the insured is diagnosed as terminally ill with a life expectancy of 24 months or less. The ADB amount equates to 50% of the total death benefit, and it may be requested in increments starting from 12 months after the qualifying diagnosis. This rider requires medical evidence for eligibility determination and is subject to a waiting period of six months following the date of policy issuance before it becomes effective. Additionally, any ADB payments received will reduce the death benefit payable upon the insured's death.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, an Insured Employee's coverage for the Progressive Income Benefit under the Policy begins on the specified effective date. This applies to both the initial coverage of Long Term Disability Benefits and any subsequent addition of this provision through Policy amendments. The exact effective date will vary depending on the individual's employment status and qualifications as outlined in the policy terms.
<EOS>
According to the terms outlined in Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 25, rows 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, and 1, 2, an insured employee will only be eligible for this benefit if they are either able to safely and independently perform all Activities of Daily Living or no longer suffering from a Cognitive Impairment. The effective date is deferred if the employee is unable to carry out these tasks without assistance on that date. Once they can fulfill these requirements, their coverage will commence immediately.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, once the Elimination Period outlined in the Schedule of Insurance is over, the insurance company will pay an extra monthly benefit to an Insured Employee if they meet two conditions: firstly, they are already receiving Total Disability or Partial Disability Monthly Benefits under the policy; secondly, they provide evidence of having suffered a Loss of Activities of Daily Living or a Cognitive Impairment (as defined in the policy). The employee is responsible for submitting this proof at their own expense.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf at pages 25 and relevant row numbers, the Progressive Income Benefit is calculated as 10% of the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings but will not exceed the Maximum Monthly Benefit for Long Term Disability Benefits or $5,000 per month (whichever is less). This maximum benefit amount is outlined in the policy's Schedule of Insurance. The Progressive Income Benefit remains unaffected by any Other Income Benefits and earnings from any form of employment.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, the Progressive Income Benefit terminates on the earliest occurrence of four scenarios: (1) the Insured Employee recovers from Loss of Activities of Daily Living or Cognitive Impairment as defined; (2) the Insured Employee is no longer eligible for Total Disability or Partial Disability Monthly Benefits under the policy; (3) the Maximum Benefit Period concludes, or (4) the Insured Employee passes away. It is noteworthy that a Family Income Benefit, if included in the policy, will not augment the amount paid to an Eligible Surviving Spouse or Children due to the Insured Employee's receipt of this Progressive Income Benefit.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, a Loss of Activities of Daily Living refers to an Insured Employee's inability, due to injury or sickness, to perform safely and independently two or more activities like bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring (from bed or chair), continence, or feeding without significant assistance from another person. These six daily living activities are specified within the document. This loss must affect all or most of the activity for the claim to be valid. The definition is found on page 25, rows [2, 3, 1, 1].
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, bathing includes personal hygiene practices such as washing in a tub, shower, or via sponge bath, with or without equipment, on row 1 of page 35. This policy section does not specify any limitations, exclusions, or restrictions for these activities related to the insurance coverage provided. It's essential to note that this policy may have additional terms and conditions regarding personal hygiene and health care that are not covered in this concise summary.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 35, rows 3 and 1, the policy covers the use of braces or artificial limbs typically worn as part of daily activities, including dressing, undressing, fastening, or unfastening these aids. This coverage applies to medically necessary situations only.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, on page 35 row 1, the policy covers assistance for toileting activities including getting to, from, and on/off the toilet, as well as related personal hygiene tasks. This service is subject to certain conditions and requirements. Specifically, the policyholder can receive up to 100% of the daily benefit for this service, but only if they require substantial assistance with these activities due to a qualifying illness or injury. The daily benefit amount will be based on the policy's daily rate at the time the service is required. This provision applies from the effective date of the policy throughout its duration.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on page 35, rows 3, 4, and 1, the policy addresses mobility-related equipment including canes, walkers, crutches, grab bars, and other support or mechanical/motorized devices. The policy provides coverage for assistance in moving in and out of bed, chairs, or wheelchairs with or without such equipment. A critical requirement is that the use of this equipment must be recommended by a healthcare professional as medically necessary for the insured's condition. Any changes to the equipment, such as upgrades or replacements, must also be approved by the policy provider.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf section on row 3, page 35 outlines the continence requirement for policyholders. If a policyholder is not continent (i.e., unable to control bladder and bowel function), related personal hygiene, including catheter or colostomy bag care, falls under this criterion. It's crucial that policyholders remain continent or manage their conditions appropriately to maintain eligibility for coverage.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, obtaining nourishment is defined as consuming food prepared and made available through means such as eating at a table, tray, or container (e.g., bowl or cup), using special equipment like feeding tubes or intravenous tubes.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 26 (rows 1-4, 1-2, 3, and 1-2), "Cognitive Impairment" denotes a permanent decline in cognitive or intellectual ability due to injury or sickness. This deterioration necessitates another person's continuous assistance or verbal guidance to prevent harm to self or others. The impairment must be confirmed by a physician using clinical evidence and standardized tests assessing short/long-term memory, orientation, and abstract reasoning. Causes can range from moderate to severe head trauma, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, or other irreversible dementias.

Importantly, these treatments must comply with the policy's terms, conditions, and limitations.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, any disability benefits will not be payable during a period of disability that commences before the insured's effective date of coverage under this policy, as detailed on row 2 of page 26. Therefore, it is crucial for the insured to establish their effective date of coverage prior to experiencing a disability in order to receive benefits from this insurance policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 26, rows 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, benefits for a Loss of Activities of Daily Living or Cognitive impairment will not be paid if the impairment is caused or worsened by, or results from, a pre-existing condition during the first 12 months after the Insured Employee's effective date under this benefit. A pre-existing condition, as defined within this document, is any injury, illness, or medical condition for which: 1) medical care, treatment, consultation, or advice was received during the 90 days before the effective date of coverage; or 2) symptoms existed during this same period that would have caused a reasonable person to seek medical care.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf (pages 26, rows 2-4), the policy does not cover disability claims resulting from mental illnesses, alcoholism, or voluntary use of controlled substances unless prescribed by a physician. Controlled substances are defined as those outlined in Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, with any subsequent amendments. This policy provision applies to disabilities caused or contributed to by these conditions.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, premium and other policy provisions on row 2 of page 26 dictate that payments, adjustments, or settlements are subject to the definitions provided within the policy. Any benefits may be reduced or forfeited if the policyholder fails to meet the specified requirements or deadlines. Additionally, any partial or total cancellation of this coverage due to non-payment will result in a loss of any accumulated cash values and dividends. Furthermore, changes to the insured's personal information must be reported promptly to maintain validity, while waiver of premium riders may apply under certain circumstances.
<EOS>
In the coverage outlined by Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 27 (rows 1, 1, 1, 2), certain exclusions are detailed under Pre-Existing Condition GL3002 as follows: claims for any medical conditions existing within 3/12 prior to the policy's effective date of January 1, 2021 are not covered. This exclusion applies ten (10) months following the policy inception and lasts up to twenty-five (25) months after the start of the policy period.

The maximum amount payable under this limit is $9800 (98 * 104, being the sum insured). This coverage does not apply if the insured has knowingly violated any motor vehicle traffic law or regulation in the place where the loss occurred.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, Disability Monthly Benefits for an Insured Employee due to Specified Injuries or Sicknesses (including Mental Sickness or Substance Abuse) will be payable subject to the policy terms but are limited to 24 months per disability period, unless the employee is hospital-confined. Notably, benefits may extend beyond 24 months if hospitalized. The document defines 'Specified Injuries or Sicknesses'.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, if an Insured Employee is hospitalized by the end of the 24th month following policy benefits payment for a Specified Injury or Sickness, benefits will continue until discharge from that facility. However, these Monthly Benefits cannot exceed the Maximum Benefit Period shown in the Schedule of Insurance.

This Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf section on Voluntary Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit (GL3002-CERT-14.3) states that this benefit provides coverage starting from January 1, 2021. The policy allows for up to 98 weeks of vocational rehabilitation services, with a weekly maximum benefit amount of $28. These services aim to help the insured return to suitable gainful employment after an injury or sickness that has prevented them from doing so. The policy requires pre-approval for these services and may cover necessary evaluations, training, education, or job placement assistance. Any changes in the plan of care require additional approval.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf at pages 30, rows 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, and 1, an insured employee who is disabled and receiving policy benefits may be eligible for a Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit. This benefit encompasses vocational evaluation, counseling, training, job placement, job modification or special equipment, and other services deemed necessary by the company to aid the employee's return to work. The company holds the authority to determine an individual's eligibility and the amount of any benefit payable.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, an eligible employee must have a disability that hinders their regular occupation performance, and afterwards lack skills, training, or experience for any other gainful occupation. The individual must possess the required physical and mental abilities to finish a Program, and should be expected to return to work post-Program completion based on motivation level and job market demand in the proposed occupation. The employee's degree of motivation and labor force demand are factors taken into consideration. Additionally, the Company will only grant this benefit if they find that the cost of the proposed services is less than their anticipated claim liability.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 30 rows 2, 1, 2, and 3, the Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit's payment will not exceed the company's anticipated claims liability. This benefit is not applicable for services covered under the insured employee's health care plan or any other vocational rehabilitation program. The company has the option to pay the provider of the services directly. It is important to note that this benefit is subject to the company's claim liabilities and does not cover services already included in the employee's health care or other vocational rehabilitation programs.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 30 rows 2, 1, 2, and 3, the Policy outlines vocational rehabilitation provisions. Either the Company, the Insured Employee, or their Physician can propose this rehabilitation. Upon approval by the Company, the Policy's Disability definition is waived during the rehabilitation period. However, after the Program concludes, the Company will reassess and determine any Long Term Disability benefits' amount and duration. The Program's terms dictate that the Policy definition of Disability resumes post-rehabilitation.
<EOS>
Under the Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit stated in Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, any Insured Employee who receives this benefit and fails to complete the program without Good Cause will not be covered for Disability during that period. The policy does not specify what constitutes 'Good Cause' or how one can demonstrate it. This rule is applicable on page numbers [30] rows [2].
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf pertains to the term "Good Cause" within the policy context. It refers to an Insured Employee's documented physical or mental impairments that prevent participation in or completion of a Program, their involvement in a medical program hindering such participation, or their active engagement in a different vocational rehabilitation program. This alternative program must either conflict with the Company-developed Program or be expected to facilitate the Employee's return to work. The Employee's good-faith participation in this conflicting or beneficial program qualifies as "Good Cause" under this provision.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf outlines a vocational rehabilitation program (Program). The Program is jointly developed with inputs from the insured employee, their physician, and any relevant employer. Its objectives, responsibilities of each party, as well as the timelines, costs, and dates for rehabilitation services are all clearly stated within it. This structured plan aims to aid the insured employee in recovering and returning to work.

This information from Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf (page 31, rows [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]) outlines the Reasonable Accommodation Benefit. If an insured employee of the employer is disabled and receiving policy benefits, the employer may be eligible for this benefit which reimburses 50% of reasonable accommodation service expenses (up to a maximum of $5,000 per employee or the company's expected liability for the employee's Long Term Disability claim). Services covered include providing accessible parking/entrance, removing workplace barriers/hazards, special seating/equipment, training materials/translation services, and other necessary accommodations to help the employee return to work. The company decides what constitutes reasonable accommodation.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on page 31 (rows 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2), an employer is eligible for the Benefit if they have an insured employee whose disability prevents them from performing their regular occupation at the worksite but can do so with a proposed accommodation. The employee must possess the necessary physical and mental abilities, though only with this accommodation. Furthermore, it is expected that they will return to work with this accommodation. However, the requested Reasonable Accommodation Benefit must be less than the anticipated liability for the insured employee's Long Term Disability claim.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 31 (rows 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2), the written proposal for reasonable accommodation services involves collaboration among the Employer, Insured Employee, and their Physician, if necessary. The proposal should clearly outline the purpose of the proposed accommodation, as well as details such as timing, dates, and costs of these services.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf (page 31), either the Company, Employer, or the Insured Employee's Physician can propose an accommodation. To be valid, this proposal must be approved by the Company in writing. Once approved, the Company will reimburse the Employer for any services provided to the Insured Employee and already paid for by the Employer. The proof of these two conditions (Employer providing services and paying providers) is required before reimbursement can be made. This policy applies to specific rows [2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2].
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 32 (rows 1, 1, 2, 1, 2), a Prior Insurance Credit will be provided to prevent coverage gaps due to insurance carrier transfers. Eligible employees, insured under the previous carrier's policy on its termination date, shall receive this credit. The credit is calculated based on the number of days left in the original policy period from the termination date until the start of the new policy. The remaining percentage of premium for those days will be credited towards the new policy, ensuring continuity of coverage.
<EOS>
Under the 'Failure to be Actively-At-Work Due to Injury or Sickness' section of Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, if an Employee was insured by the previous carrier at the time of transfer and was not actively working due to injury or sickness on the policy's Effective Date, coverage will be provided based on the prior carrier's policy terms, should it have continued. The Company will pay the benefit that the previous carrier would have paid, minus any amounts for which the previous carrier is responsible. This coverage applies only to individuals specified in the document's given page and row numbers.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, the Pre-Existing Condition Disability benefits are outlined. An Employee is eligible if insured by the prior carrier's policy at transfer and Actively-At-Work on the Policy Effective Date. The Company applies the Policy's Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion initially. If the Insured Employee qualifies for benefits despite this, they will be paid according to the Policy's schedule.

   If the Employee cannot meet the current or prior carrier's Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion but has continuous coverage under both policies, payment will adhere to the benefit schedule and terms of either the Policy without its Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion or the prior carrier's policy, whichever is less restrictive.

This information from Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf outlines the Three Month Survivor Benefit on page [33], rows [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]. The policy stipulates that the Company will provide a lump sum equal to three times the Insured Employee's Last Monthly Benefit upon proof of death following Disability lasting 180 days or more and during Monthly Benefit receipt.

Under the Family Care Expense Benefit of Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 34, rows 1 & 1 (GL3001-AMEND.PHYS 12 32), you are eligible to receive financial support for family care expenses if:

<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 34 and relevant rows, the insurance policy offers Family Care Expense coverage. This benefit is payable when an insured employee is either receiving Partial Disability Monthly Benefits or Total Disability Benefits under the policy. Additionally, the employee must meet one of the following conditions: being terminally ill, suffering from cognitive impairment, or experiencing a loss of Activities of Daily Living. Notably, this Family Care Expense Benefit is additional to all other policy benefits and will not be reduced by Other Income Benefits. The benefit applies whether the employee is temporarily or permanently disabled.
<EOS>
As outlined in Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, the Insured Employee is required to provide monthly proof of family care expenses for Dependents. Adequate proof comprises a signed receipt from the care provider detailing: the Dependent's name and age; reasons for care if the Dependent exceeds the defined maximum age; dates, total charges, and payments for care; and the provider's name, address, telephone number. This evidence must be submitted on a regular basis to remain eligible for coverage.
<EOS>
This document, Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on page 34 row 1, specifies a unique Number/Taxpayer Identification Number as a key requirement for the insurance policy. The Number is essential for policy administration and claim processing. It should be accurate, complete, and provided promptly to ensure uninterrupted service. Any changes to this number must be reported promptly to maintain policy validity. Failure to provide or update this information may result in policy cancellation or claim denial.
<EOS>
According to the Family Care Expense Benefit outlined in Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf (page 34, row 2), eligible dependents can receive up to $250 per month for employee expenses that are not reimbursable from other sources. The benefit will match actual family care expenses paid by the insured. This benefit does not exceed the stated limit of $250 per dependent, per month. Please note that this information is subject to the terms and conditions of the policy.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, the Family Care Expense Benefit will terminate on the earliest of three occasions: firstly, when the Insured Employee's Total or Partial Disability Benefits under the policy conclude; secondly, when an Insured Employee's Dependents no longer fit the definition of a Dependent in this provision; thirdly, after the Company has made 12 consecutive monthly Family Care Expense Benefit payments.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, a 'Child' includes the Insured Employee's biological, adopted, stepchild, foster, or legally guarded child. The coverage applies to these designated children for specified benefits. It is essential to note that eligibility is based on the Insured Employee maintaining their legal status as guardian at the time of claim. These provisions are detailed in rows 2 of page 34 in the document.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 34 (rows 1-4), cognitive impairment refers to a permanent deterioration or loss of cognitive or intellectual capacity in the insured employee or dependent, requiring constant assistance or verbal cues to prevent self or others from harm. This diagnosis must be supported by a physician using clinical evidence and standardized tests assessing memory, orientation, and reasoning skills. The impairment may stem from moderate to severe head trauma, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, or other irreversible dementia.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, a 'Dependent' is defined as the Insured Employee's: legal spouse who resides with them and requires assistance due to a mental or physical condition; children under 16 years old; unmarried children aged 16 or older who also live with the employee and are incapable of independent living due to a disability; or parent(s) or in-law(s) who reside with the employee and require assistance due to a mental or physical condition. All dependents must be incapable of independent living due to a mental or physical condition.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, 'Family Care Expense' refers to costs associated with the care of a Dependent, provided by a licensed care provider. Notably, this dependent must not be a member of the Insured Employee's immediate family or reside in their home. This definition is found on pages 35, rows [2, 1, 2, 1, 2].
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, a Dependent qualifies as "Incapable of Independent Living" under three conditions: when they are terminally ill, suffer from cognitive impairment, or experience loss of activities of daily living. To meet these criteria, evidence of terminal illness must involve prognosis of less than 12 months to live or a permanent condition that necessitates life-sustaining procedures. Cognitive impairment entails significant deterioration in mental abilities, while loss of activities of daily living involves the inability to perform two out of six essential tasks such as bathing, continence, dressing, eating, toileting, or transferring without assistance. The policy does not specify a time frame for these conditions to be met.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 35, rows 2, 3, 1, and 1, the term "Loss of Activities of Daily Living" refers to an insured employee or dependent's inability to perform safely and completely, without another person's active assistance for most of the activity, two or more of six specified daily living tasks. These tasks include eating, toileting, transferring (moving from bed to chair, for instance), bathing, dressing, and continence (involuntary control of urination and bowel movements). This stipulation applies if these functional losses are sustained due to a covered injury or sickness. The loss must be substantial, rendering the individual entirely or almost entirely dependent on others. This definition pertains to policies regarding long-term disability benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, pages 35 and 36, under row numbers 2, 1, and 1, the term "Terminally Ill" refers to an Insured Employee or Dependent diagnosed with a medical condition that is expected to result in death within 12 months despite appropriate treatment (GL3001-AMEND.PHYS 12 34). This definition is crucial for understanding eligibility under certain policy provisions.
<EOS>
In Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, specific definitions of Partial Disability (Partially Disabled) and Total Disability (Totally Disabled) for physicians and nurses differ from those outlined in the Definitions section. Here, disability is defined as follows: A physician or nurse is considered Partially Disabled if they cannot perform one or more essential functions of their regular occupation with reasonable continuity. They are deemed Totally Disabled when unable to perform any material duty of any occupation for which they are qualified by training or experience. This applies only to these two professional groups, as stated in rows [1, 2, 3, 1, 2] on page [36].
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, partial disability or being partially disabled means that the insured employee is unable, due to an injury or sickness, to perform one or more of their specialty's main duties in the practice of medicine on a full-time basis and is engaged in partial disability employment. The maximum benefit period and duration are contingent upon this condition, as defined by the policy details provided on page 36, rows [2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2]. This situation applies when the insured employee receives wages or income from alternative employment during their partial disability status. The specific percentage of wage replacement benefits will depend on the extent of the disability and the policy's terms.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf (page numbers [36], rows [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2]) defines Total Disability (Totally Disabled) as an inability to perform one or more Main Duties of the Insured Employee's recognized specialty or sub-specialty by the American Board of Medical Specialties in the practice of medicine on a full-time basis due to injury or sickness. The specialty encompasses the general specialty or sub-specialty not recognized by the American Board, described either in the U.S. Department of Labor Dictionary of Occupational Titles or as the general specialty if unrecognized. Main Duties are those job tasks normally and continuously performed during the 12 months preceding the Disability start date that cannot be reasonably modified or omitted. Loss of a professional, occupational license, or certification does not constitute Disability by itself.

This information from Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on page [37], rows [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], outlines the Arkansas Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association (Guaranty Association). Residents purchasing life, annuity, or health and accident insurance in Arkansas are covered by its member insurers. In case a member insurer becomes financially incapable of meeting obligations, the Guaranty Association will ensure protection, within certain limits, to policyholders living in the state and may maintain coverage in specific cases. The member insurers offer this additional protection through the Guaranty Association, although it is not unlimited. Consumers are advised to exercise caution in selecting financially stable insurance companies as this protection does not replace that responsibility.
<EOS>
This information is drawn from the Arkansas Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Act (the "Act") as detailed in Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 37, rows 1-3. The Act provides coverage for certain life and health insurance policies if an insurer becomes insolvent. Coverage includes death benefits up to $300,000 or policy face amount (whichever is less) and unearned premiums refund up to 60 days' worth. Policy riders and annuity contracts are excluded from coverage. The Association may also withhold payments if the insolvent insurer owes money to another state. This coverage is subject to a maximum aggregate liability of $5 million per policyholder.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, this policy section does not fully encompass all provisions of a certain Act, and it does not alter any rights or obligations for individuals under the Act, nor for the Guaranty Association. This means that the act's original terms and conditions, as well as the responsibilities of both parties, remain unchanged.
<EOS>
According to the coverage section in Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf (pages 37-38), individuals residing in the state are protected by the Guaranty Association if they possess life, annuity, or health insurance contracts or policies. This protection extends to beneficiaries, payees, or assignees of policy or contract owners, regardless of their location. The notice effective date is GAN-GRP-AR NOTICE-P/C 03/20 and the current update is from 01/01/21. Essentially, if your insurer is a member, you are covered by this Guaranty Association regardless of where your beneficiaries reside.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages [38, 39] specifies exclusions from coverage by the Guaranty Association. Exclusions apply when policy owners: reside in a state where the insolvent insurer was incorporated and the guaranty association protects non-residents; the insurer was unauthorized to do business in this State; or their policy is issued by certain organizations like nonprofit hospitals, HMOs, fraternal benefit societies, etc., subject to future assessments.

The Guaranty Association does not cover: non-guaranteed amounts in variable life/annuity contracts, reinsurance policies (unless an assumption certificate was issued), interest rate yields beyond average rates, dividends and voting rights, experience rating credits, employer plans (self-funded or administered but not insured), unallocated annuity contracts, federally protected benefit plans, portions of an unallocated contract not owned by residents/government lotteries, assessments preempted by state/federal law, obligations not arising under the policy, claims based on marketing materials, side letters, riders, or misrepresentations, and contractual agreements for defined contribution benefit plans.

This notice is applicable from GAN-GRP-AR NOTICE-P/C 03/20 37 01/01/21.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, page 39, row 1, the Guaranty Association's coverage obligations are subject to certain limitations. Specifically, the amount of coverage is limited to the lesser of: (i) 5% of the policyholder's total admitted assets; or (ii) $5 million. The Association's obligation is also restricted by applicable law and statutory limits, which may reduce the covered amount further. The coverage applies to losses incurred between July 1, 1986, and the later of either the date of liquidation or the date on which the insolvent member company has failed to pay a claim for 30 days after becoming legally obligated to do so. The Association's coverage does not extend beyond the lesser of (i) $50 million in any one calendar year, or (ii) 5% of the total admitted assets of all member companies at the time of payment. This limitation is per insolvent company and per state. The Guaranty Association may also seek recourse from any parties responsible for causing the member company's insolvency.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf outlines the Guaranty Association's obligations. The Association will not pay more than the insurance company would owe under a policy or contract, with maximum limits for various benefits: $300,000 in life and annuity benefits, health insurance benefits, disability and long term care benefits, present value of annuity benefits, and life insurance death benefits or net cash surrender values. These caps apply regardless of the number of policies and contracts held, even if they offer different types of coverage. A single contract holder has a $1,000,000 limit for unallocated annuity benefits. The Association's obligations are set before considering its subrogation and assignment rights or assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer.

According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, your plan's fiduciaries—those responsible for its operation—must act prudently and in the best interests of participants and beneficiaries.

Under ERISA, you may file a lawsuit in federal court for unprovided documents within 30 days of request, with the court potentially requiring the Plan Administrator to provide materials and pay up to $110 per day until received. If your benefits claim is denied or ignored, you can sue in either state or federal court. In cases of plan fiduciary misuse of funds or discrimination for asserting rights, seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor or file a lawsuit in federal court with the court deciding costs and legal fees. If successful, the person sued may be ordered to pay these costs and fees; if unsuccessful, you could be liable if your claim is deemed frivolous.
