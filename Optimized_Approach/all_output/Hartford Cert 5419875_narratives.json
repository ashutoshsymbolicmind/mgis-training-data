        "narrative": "In the Hartford Cert 5419875 policy, pre-existing conditions are defined and addressed in specific provisions. If you transition to this policy within 30 days of being covered under a prior one, the pre-existing condition limitation ends on the earliest date among two scenarios: either the policy effective date if there was no pre-existing condition restriction in the previous policy, or the date the restriction would have ended had the prior policy persisted. Any increase in benefit amount due to changes in options, class, or policy itself will not be paid for a disability linked to a pre-existing condition unless it begins after the specified time period (either stated in your certificate or 730 consecutive days of continuous insurance) without medical care for the pre-existing condition.\n\nThe definition of a pre-existing condition is any accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, pregnancy, or episode of substance abuse for which you received medical care during the shorter period between your coverage effective date and either the certificate period or a 730-day window ending on the day before your coverage start or any change in coverage.\n\nIf you become a surviving spouse, defined as your legal spouse at the time of your death (with domestic partner recognition if you've executed an acceptable Domestic Partner Affidavit), you'll continue to receive survivor income benefits so long as you meet the requirements described in the affidavit.\n\nThe Seat Belt and Air Bag Benefit will not be payable if the injured person is operating the vehicle at the time of injury while intoxicated or under the influence of narcotics, unless administered on a physician's advice. The drug exclusion for Accidental Death and Dismemberment benefits now includes injury sustained while under the influence of narcotics, except when administered by a physician. Autopsies must be performed during the period of contestability in South Carolina if required."
