This disability should be medically verified by a physician and continued proof is required upon request.\n\nThe Total Disability Benefit ceases when the insured individual recovers, dies, or chooses not to engage in Partial Disability Employment. The Maximum Benefit Period and the duration of Own Occupation Period are specified in the policy.\n\nIncontinence of bladder and bowel function, requiring personal hygiene care such as a catheter or colostomy bag, and loss of ability to eat by any means are considered total disabilities. If an exam is required, non-cooperation may lead to suspension or denial of benefits.\n\nThe policy also acknowledges the need for additional proof regarding other income sources, with failure to provide this information leading to potential benefit denial or suspension within 45 days of request."
