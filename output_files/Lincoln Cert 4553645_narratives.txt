According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the contract encompasses the insurance policy and its amendments, the policyholder's application attached to the policy, any participating employers' applications or agreements, and individual applications of insured employees. Statements made by both the policyholder and insured employees are representations, not warranties, except when contained in a written, signed statement by an insured employee, for which a copy must have been furnished.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, after a policy has been active for two years from its issuance date, no statement from the policyholder or any employee can be utilized to void the policy or reduce or deny a claim.

According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the company can only rescind insurance for an 'Insured Employee' without their written consent under two conditions: firstly, if the employee commits fraud or misrepresents material facts regarding eligibility or any other crucial details that would have led the company to decline coverage. However, rescission is not allowed due to an employee's failure to meet eligibility requirements when the policyholder has requested their inclusion under coverage. Secondly, rescission can occur if it solely results from the lack of advance notification of the employee's termination of employment. A "Material Misrepresentation" refers to an incomplete or false statement that led the company to issue coverage they would have refused otherwise. Rescission means cancelling insurance effective from its start date, and the company will refund all premiums paid for the rescinded insurance, less any benefits paid for the employee's claims. The company also reserves the right to recover any excess claims payments.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, if an Insured Employee's age is misstated, any benefits will be determined based on the amount the paid premium would have purchased at the correct age. This means that if the employee's true age was higher than initially stated, the benefits received may be less than anticipated due to the lower premium paid. Conversely, if the employee was younger than reported, the benefits could potentially exceed expectations due to the higher purchasing power of the premium paid for an older age bracket. This provision is outlined on page 10, row 43 of the policy document.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, it is clarified that the Policyholder may act on their behalf or as an individual, never as the Company's agent.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 10 and subsequent rows 49-52, the Predisability Income under this policy is denominated in U.S. dollars, while all premiums and benefits are required to be paid in the same currency.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, this policy provides benefits mandated by Workers' Compensation laws and state disability insurance plans.

If no decision is made within 105 days following the initial claim or 60 days post-complete claim submission, the Insured Employee has the right to an immediate review, as if the claim was denied.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 12, rows 50 and 51, the Company may require additional information from the Insured Employee to process a claim. This data must be supplied within 45 days after the request, and any resulting delay will not affect the given time limits for claim processing.
<EOS>
Under Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the Insured Employee has up to 180 days from receiving a denial notice to request a claim review by submitting a written request along with supporting documents. The Company will review the claim and respond within 45 days or 90 days in special cases, providing reasons for their decision according to the Policy and internal guidelines. If the claim is upheld, the denial notice will detail further appeal procedures available, access rights to relevant claim information, and the option to request a state insurance department review or legal action. This process complies with GL3002-CERT-6 04 MN 12 04/01/11.
<EOS>
In accordance with the Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, if the Company encounters a special case necessitating over 45 days to process an appeal, it will extend up to 45 more days. By the 30th day following the request for review, the Insured Employee receives a written notice detailing the unique circumstances causing the delay, whether additional information is required to assess the claim, and an estimated decision timeline.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 13, rows 20 and 21, if additional information from the Insured Employee is needed for an appeal processing, it should be supplied within 45 days. Any delay in providing this information will not affect the timeline for appeal processing.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, in case of disputes under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), a plan participant or beneficiary must initially exhaust administrative remedies. This entails seeking two separate reviews of any adverse claim decision as outlined within this section. Once these requirements are met, an ERISA plan participant or beneficiary may file a legal action under Section 502(a) of the act.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 13, rows 31 to 33 indicates that the Company will relinquish any right to contest a claimant's failure to exhaust administrative remedies under ERISA. In such cases, the claim will proceed without the need for exhausting additional administrative steps or appeals before filing a lawsuit. The waiver applies only to the exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement and does not affect any other conditions or deadlines specified in the policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, if overpayments occur on short-term or long-term disability benefits, full reimbursement to the company is required within 60 days. Failure to reimburse may lead to: 1) reduction of future benefits and suspension of the Minimum Monthly Benefit until full reimbursement; 2) reduction of benefits under any group insurance policy issued by the company; or 3) recovery of overpayments from the Insured Employee or their estate. Overpayments can result from errors in processing claims, Other Income Benefits received, fraud, misrepresentation, omission of facts, or any other reason.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, any legal action to recover benefits must wait for a minimum of 60 days after providing written proof of claim. Importantly, such legal action can only be initiated within three years from the date the written proof of claim is required. This timeframe applies to the specific policy outlined in the document.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the insurance company retains discretionary authority over the policy. This includes managing the policy, interpreting its provisions, administering claims, and resolving questions arising under it. The Company's authority encompasses setting administrative procedures, determining eligibility for benefits, resolving claim-related queries, and deciding what information is required for these decisions. Moreover, the Company holds the power to resolve all matters when an internal review of a claim is requested. Any decision made by the Company in this regard is final and binding, though the insured employee has the right to seek review from a state insurance department or legal action (except residents of California). This provision expires on 04/01/11.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf (page 14, rows 4-5), certain employee classes are eligible for insurance under the policy. However, the company reserves the right to review and terminate any or all eligible classes if a class ceases to be covered by the policy. The eligible employee classes are specified in the schedule of the document.
<EOS>
According to the eligibility date section of Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, an employee is eligible for insurance coverage under this policy on the later of two dates: either the date the policy was issued or the completion of the waiting period. The waiting period lasts for a specified duration of 90 days, after which the employee becomes insured if they remain continuously employed by the employer during this time. Coverage may be initiated prior to the completion of the waiting period under specific conditions, such as during an open enrollment period or if the employee has a qualifying life event. The policy takes effect from the date of coverage activation and continues for the duration specified in the insurance contract.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, prior service credit can reduce the waiting period for benefits when a former employee is rehired within one year of their employment ending, or if an employee returns from an approved Family or Medical Leave within 12 weeks as mandated by federal law, or any longer duration necessitated by a similar state law. Additionally, this applies if an employee resumes work after Military Leave within the timeframe required by federal USERRA law. This provision only pertains to individuals in the Eligible Class.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf outlines the effective dates for coverage. An employee's initial coverage begins at 12:01 a.m., either on the first day of the Insurance Month following eligibility or their return to Active Work, whichever comes first. Coverage activation requires either a signed payroll deduction order or premium payment through a Flexible Benefits Plan account. Approval of Evidence of Insurability may also be necessary. Increased or additional coverage begins at 12:01 a.m., effective on the earliest of these conditions. Decreases in coverage take effect immediately, regardless of Active Work status.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 14 and 15 outlines the Evidence of Insurability requirements. An Employee must provide this evidence if they apply for coverage or an increased amount beyond 31 days after becoming eligible, or request to cancel, stop payroll deductions, or premium payments from their Flexible Benefits Plan account. Coverage may also require evidence when it lapses due to unpaid premiums, or when electing optional, supplemental, or voluntary coverage exceeding Guaranteed Issue Amounts shown in the Schedule of Benefits. These regulations are found in rows 61-78 and 1, 4, 5 on the specified pages.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf (page 15, rows 5-10), an insured employee may transition between Eligible Classes. Coverage under the new Eligible Class becomes effective on the first day of the subsequent insurance month following or coinciding with the change date, except for instances specified in the Effective Date provision concerning increases or decreases.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, an insured employee may reinstate their coverage following a break in service, family or medical leave, military leave, or other approved leave within specified timeframes. Reinstatement allows for re-enrollment without satisfying new waiting periods or providing evidence of insurability. The reinstated insurance amount cannot exceed the terminated amount.

Reinstatement is available:
1. upon return from an approved family or medical leave within 12 weeks (federal law) or a longer period (similar state law);
2. upon return from a military leave within the federal USERRA law's required period;
3. upon return from any other approved leave of absence within six months after the leave begins;
4. within 12 months following a layoff or termination for any other reason.

To reinstate, the employee must apply or be re-enrolled within 31 days after resuming active work in an eligible class. The reinstated coverage becomes effective on the date of return to active work. During this process, months of leave will count towards any unmet Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion period, and a new Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion will not apply to the reinstated amount of insurance, but will apply to any increased amount.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf outlines the circumstances under which an insured employee's coverage terminates. Coverage ends at midnight on the earliest of:

1. The policy or employer's participation termination date, retaining any claim made prior to termination.
2. The date when the insured employee's class is no longer eligible for insurance, if they cease to be a member of an Eligible Class, or on the last day of the Insurance Month in which they request termination.
3. Premium payment dates: the last day of the Insurance Month for which premium was paid on their behalf, the end of the period following the last required premium payment, or the end of a particular insurance benefit's coverage period within the policy.
4. The date of employment termination with the employer, unless continuation of coverage is provided below. An exception applies if the insured enters active military duty for more than 30 days, in which case they must provide proof of service for any unearned premium to be refunded.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 16, rows 31 and 33, if an insured employee ceases active work, their insurance coverage terminates. However, continuation rights allow for the coverage to be maintained in specific scenarios. The policyholder can elect to convert the group coverage into an individual policy within six months of cessation, provided they are under age 65 and meet certain eligibility requirements. Additionally, if the employee becomes totally disabled before age 65, the coverage can continue without any further premium payments. This continuation ensures financial protection for eligible individuals in these situations.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4553645 policy details disability coverage. During an Insured Employee's total disability absence, coverage can continue throughout the Elimination Period if the employer pays the required premium. After this period and until benefits end, premiums are waived. If coverage continues after a waiver period, premiums must be resumed once due. The policy further stipulates that if an employee experiences partial disability, continued coverage occurs without additional premium payments during both the Elimination Period and benefit payment periods. Premium payments will only recommence post-benefit period conclusion.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, during an approved Family or Medical Leave, insurance coverage for an Insured Employee may be continued until the earliest of: a) the end of the leave period approved by the Employer; b) 12 weeks as required by federal law, or more favorable state law; c) when the employee notifies the employer they will not return; or d) starting employment with another employer. Premium payments must be made by the Employer throughout this coverage period. Additionally, if an Insured Employee is entitled to Disability leave, they will receive a more favorable continuation, but not covered under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf (page 16, rows 64-67), during a military leave, an insured employee's coverage may be extended for the same duration as an approved Family or Medical Leave. To maintain this coverage, premium payments must be consistently received from the employer throughout the period of continued coverage.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 16 and 17, in the event of a temporary lay-off or an approved leave other than Family, Medical, or Military Leave, insurance coverage can be maintained for three Insurance Months. The employer must make premium payments throughout this period to keep the policy active. This provision is outlined on rows [69, 70, 71, 72, 1, 3, 4].
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4553645 document on pages 17, rows 5 and 6 outlines conditions for continuation of insurance coverage. The employer is prohibited from discriminating unfairly among similar employees during this process. Insurance can't be continued if an Insured Employee ceases active work due to a labor dispute, strike, work slowdown, or lockout.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf outlines the Policy termination process due to Company or Policyholder action, or automatic termination for unpaid premiums within the Grace Period. Upon such termination, each Insured Employee will receive a written notice at their last known address, at least 30 days before the effective date, unless the Company has evidence of a similar group plan replacement within 31 days. If the required notice is not given, coverage continues for 120 days or until replaced, whichever is sooner. The document also specifies that if insurance terminates, it will continue for 120 days in accordance with the Policy's terms, or until a similar group plan replaces it.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, during a Disability, an Insured Employee's coverage termination will not impact the benefits payable for that disability period. Specifically, if an employee becomes disabled and their coverage ends, they will continue receiving benefits throughout this time of incapacity. This provision applies only to instances when the employee's employment status changes due to a disability. No specific duration for the disability is stipulated in this section. The payable benefits remain contingent on meeting all other policy requirements and conditions as stated elsewhere in the policy document.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4553645 policy detail on Conversion Privilege outlines specific provisions for converting Term Life insurance coverage to permanent Universal Life Insurance. The conversion can be exercised during the level term period up to age 80, with a maximum conversion amount limited to the lesser of the policy's net cash value or the available conversion amount based on the current guaranteed universal life rates.

The guaranteed minimum death benefit amount for the converted policy is the same as the original coverage, and the new policy accumulates a cash value based on the greater of the daily values credited under the initial term life insurance policy or the current guaranteed universal life rates. Additionally, any outstanding policy loans must be repaid in full upon conversion.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, an Insured Employee's coverage terminates when they resign, are terminated (with or without cause), go on a lay-off or leave of absence, or remain on a lay-off or leave of absence beyond the continuation period provided in the Individual Termination section. Eligible employees can convert their long-term disability insurance to an individual policy without providing medical evidence of insurability. To be eligible for conversion, an employee must have been insured under the Employer's group plan for at least 12 consecutive months before coverage termination. The 12 months can be a combination of coverages from the Policy and any prior group long-term disability plans that it replaces.
<EOS>
This document, Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, details that within 31 days following insurance coverage under the Policy, an application for conversion must be submitted. The converted benefits and amount of insurance may differ from those stipulated in the existing policy. Note that these modifications could significantly impact your coverage terms.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the conversion privilege is not accessible for Insured Employees whose insurance terminates due to policy termination, amendments excluding their class, eligibility class changes, retirement/death, unpaid premiums, or disability under the policy. Additionally, this privilege is inapplicable if the employee becomes insured for long-term disability benefits under another group plan before 31 days from the original termination, unless otherwise specified. If an Insured Employee converts their coverage and then resumes active employment in an eligible class, their conversion coverage will end on the day preceding re-enrollment. Simultaneous benefits are not provided for the same disability period under both the policy and conversion coverage. This information is derived from rows 25 to 5 of pages 18 and 19.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the insurance company will provide a Total Disability Monthly Benefit to an insured employee under specific conditions: they must be totally disabled, become disabled while covered for this benefit, be under regular physician care, and submit proof of continued disability and medical care at their expense upon request. The benefit stops on the earliest of three events: when the employee is no longer totally disabled or dies, upon reaching the Maximum Benefit Period's end, or if they choose not to engage in Partial Disability Employment during the respective periods. Proportional benefits are paid for partial months of total disability. The company may deny or suspend payments under certain circumstances, such as failure to cooperate with required medical examinations or postponing them more than twice. Additionally, proof may be requested within 45 days after a request is mailed for additional evidence or proof of other income benefits application.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf document details the Total Disability Monthly Benefit calculation. The benefit is derived from the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings multiplied by the Benefit Percentage, capped at the Maximum Monthly Benefit. Other Income Benefits are subtracted. The benefit will not fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit, unless combined with Other Income Benefits it doesn't exceed 100% of the Basic Monthly Earnings. The Benefit Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period are defined in the Schedule of Benefits (GL3002-CERT-10 05 Any Occ Def. Res 19 04/01/11).
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf outlines the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit. To qualify, an insured employee must be under a physician's regular care, engaged in partial disability employment earning at least 20% of pre-disability income, and submit proof upon request. The Elimination Period can be satisfied with total or partial disability days. Partial Disability Monthly Benefits may cease on the earliest of: the date of death, end of maximum benefit period, when earning more than 99% for 24 months or 85% after 24 months, or if the employee is able to work full-time but chooses not to. Proportional benefits are paid for partial months. The Company may deny or suspend payments if the employee fails a required medical exam without good cause, delays a required exam more than twice, doesn't provide proof within 45 days of request, or doesn't apply for other income benefits within 45 days of request.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4553645 policy detail (pages 21, rows 3, 6, and 7) outlines the Progressive Calculation section (GL3002-CERT-10.4). The calculation is based on a factor of 20 applied on or after April 1, 2011. The percentage of this factor used to determine the premium will depend on the risk classification assigned to the policyholder. For instance, if the policyholder falls under the highest risk category, the premium would be calculated using a 90% of the factor. Conversely, the lowest risk category would utilize a 10% factor in the calculation. This progressive calculation system ensures that premiums are more accurately reflective of each policyholder's level of risk.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, during partial disability, the Insured Employee's lost income will be replaced by a Partial Disability Monthly Benefit that does not exceed the Total Disability Monthly Benefit, which would otherwise be paid in cases of total disability without employment. The Partial Disability Monthly Benefit equals the lesser of two options: A or B. Option A is the amount calculated based on the employee's pre-disability monthly earnings multiplied by a percentage (66 2/3%). If the calculation results in an amount greater than the Total Disability Monthly Benefit, then the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit will be equal to the Total Disability Monthly Benefit instead. This benefit is payable as long as the partial disability continues.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 21, rows 12 and 14, the Lost Income benefit for the insured employee involves their Pre-disability income minus all other income. This benefit extends to earnings from Partial Disability Employment as well. It is essential to note that any benefits received are subject to a specified percentage reduction based on the employee's concurrent earnings. For instance, if an employee earns 60% of their Pre-disability income during partial disability employment, the Lost Income benefit would be reduced accordingly. This reduction percentage can vary depending on the individual circumstances and policy details.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages [21, 22] outlines the Total Disability Monthly Benefit payable to the Insured Employee. The benefit is calculated as the employee's Predisability Income multiplied by the Benefit Percentage, but is limited to the Maximum Monthly Benefit. Other Income Benefits are excluded except for earnings from Partial Disability Employment. The Partial Disability Monthly Benefit will never fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit. These parameters - Benefit Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period - can be found in the Schedule of Benefits in GL3002-CERT-11-INT 10 MN Prim & Fam SS Integ. The stipulated dates are April 1st, 2011.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, specific benefits, awards, settlements, or earnings stemming from particular sources will impact the Insured Employee's Monthly Benefit amount. Exceptions include Retirement Benefits and Earnings. For all other sources, the amounts must originate from the same Disability for which a Monthly Benefit is payable under the Policy. Critically, these derived amounts are offset when determining the monthly benefit sum.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf details Workers' Compensation benefits, covering job-related injuries or sicknesses under various laws, such as Workers' Compensation and occupational disease statutes, the Jones Act, the Longshoreman's and Harbor Worker's Act, Maritime Maintenance, Wages or Cure Doctrine, or any replacement plans. Benefits can extend to partial or total disability (temporary or permanent), as well as vocational rehabilitation.
<EOS>
This document, Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, outlines supplementary benefits subject to compulsory state or federal laws. Specifically mentioned are temporary disability income benefit statutes and other compulsory acts (excluding those under Motor Vehicle "No Fault" coverage). The section highlights that these benefits may apply to the insured employee, contingent on eligibility. These benefits might include state-mandated temporary disability income, with details subject to the specific legislation in question.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, page 22, row 32, any group insurance plan other than credit or mortgage insurance is relevant for the Insured Employee. Eligibility for disability income benefits from such plans must be considered alongside this policy. The specific terms and conditions of these additional insurance plans will dictate the benefits received and the timing of those benefits. Important aspects to note include any waiting periods, benefit amounts, and percentages specified in the other group insurance plan documents. The Intercompany Exchange Ratio is also a factor, as it may impact the policy's calculation of the disability income benefits.
<EOS>
According to the Employee Benefit Plans section in Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf (pages 22, rows 35-36), disability income benefits for the Insured Employee do not include sick leave, salary continuance plan, vacation pay, severance pay, or pay for work performed during a Disability. Only benefits related to the specific disability income insurance are included. This means that these excluded forms of payment will not impact the insured employee's eligibility or benefit calculations under this policy.
<EOS>
According to the Employer's Retirement Plan details on Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, page 22, row 39, any Disability or Retirement Benefits received by the Insured Employee are subject to specific rules. The Benefits amount will be reduced if the Employee receives a pension or annuity from another source. This reduction follows a percentage based on the other source's benefits start date compared to the Employer's Retirement Plan benefits start date. For instance, if the other source's benefits begin before the Employer's Retirement Plan benefits, the reduction percentage will be higher than if it begins after. The maximum duration of these reductions is 5 years from the start of the other source's benefits. This rule applies only when the combined Benefits exceed a specified limit, which may vary depending on the Employee's age and service with the Employer at the time of benefit receipt.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 22, row numbers 42 and 43, government retirement plan benefits such as Social Security will be offset in the event of receiving disability or survivor income from our policy. The reduction percentage varies depending on the amount of your concurrently received benefits. For instance, if your combined monthly benefit amount is less than $1,750, there will be no offset. However, if it exceeds this amount, the offset begins at a rate of 50% and increases to 100% once your combined benefit reaches $2,450 or more per month. The offset percentage will remain constant for as long as you continue to receive both benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 22, row numbers 45 and 46, the Disability Benefits for the Insured Employee are detailed. In the event of the employee's disability, the child is also eligible to receive benefits. The benefit amount is a percentage of the employee's base salary, up to a maximum of $10,000 per month. Eligibility continues until the child turns 26 or reaches the maximum benefit period, whichever comes first. Additionally, there is a survivor benefit option available for the child upon the employee's death, with the same eligibility conditions and percentage calculation applying to this scenario. The policy also includes an option for the spouse to receive benefits in case of the employee's disability, but specific details about that are not provided within these rows.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, under unreduced retirement benefits eligible for the Insured Employee, a spouse or child may also be entitled to these benefits due to the employee's eligibility. This benefit is subject to certain conditions: (1) The survivor must not be remarried before age 60; (2) If the Insured Employee dies before retirement, the survivor can receive benefits at the same rate as if the employee had retired on the day of death; and (3) For a child, eligibility extends up to age 18 or 22 if enrolled full-time in an accredited educational institution. In all cases, these benefits continue until the survivor remarries or dies. The percentage of benefits for a spouse is 60% and 75% for a child.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf specifies that reduced retirement benefits received by the Insured Employee or their spouse may affect retirement benefits. Social Security and other benefits for a noncustodial child will not be regarded as Other Income Benefits. The term "Government Retirement Plans" encompasses disability and retirement benefits under four categories: 1) federal Social Security Act, Jones Act, or Railroad Retirement Act; 2) Canada Pension Plan or Quebec Pension Plan; 3) any comparable plan or legislation from other countries, states, provinces, or political units; and 4) any substitute plan. This policy is outlined in GL3002-CERT-11-INT 10 MN Prim & Fam SS Integ on April 1, 2011.
<EOS>
Under Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, "Earnings" refer to any income an Insured Employee earns or receives from any occupation, as reported for federal tax purposes. This includes gross earnings of a salaried or hourly employee (as shown on Form W-2), comprising wages, tips, commissions, bonuses, overtime pay, and pre-tax contributions to Section 125 Plans, flexible spending accounts, or qualified deferred compensation plans. Additionally, it encompasses the net profit of proprietors from Form 1040, Schedule C, professionals' net profit as shareholders on the same form, partners' net earnings from self-employment (Schedule K-1), and Subchapter S Corporation shareholders' net earnings from trade or business activities (also shown on Schedule K-1).
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, several types of income will not be considered Other Income Benefits or be offset when determining disability benefits. These include:

1. Cost-of-living increases in any Other Income Benefit (except Earnings), effective only after the first offset for that benefit during a period of Disability.
2. Reimbursements for hospital, medical, or surgical expenses and attorney fees and other costs related to claiming Other Income Benefits.
3. Group credit or mortgage disability insurance benefits, early retirement benefits not elected or received under the federal Social Security Act or other Government Retirement Plan, and amounts from Employer's Retirement Plans representing contributions or received upon termination without disability or retirement.
4. Benefits from 401(k), profit-sharing, thrift plans, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), tax sheltered annuities (TSAs), stock ownership plans, or non-qualified deferred compensation plans.
5. Vacation pay, holiday pay, severance pay, and disability income benefits under any individual policy, association group plan, franchise plan, auto liability insurance policy.

Exceptions to Other Income Benefits are detailed across multiple rows on pages [23, 24].
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, page 24, row 5, any Income Benefits that impact the Policy's benefits will adhere to the following rules: If the Insured Employee receives Public Disability Insurance (PDI) or Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), there will be an offset applied on the Income Benefit amount equivalent to the PDI or SSDI benefits received, whichever is lower. This offset percentage depends on the nature of the disability, with a 100% offset for total disability and a prorated offset for partial disability based on the percentage of disability rating.

In cases where both Policy income and Pension income are received, the Policy income will be reduced by the amount that, when combined with the Pension income, exceeds 85% of the Insured Employee's pre-disability income. This reduction will not apply if the Policy income is less than $400 per month or if the Pension income is less than $40 per month.

Furthermore, if the Insured Employee receives Other Income Benefits from any source other than the policy and PDI/SSDI, a pro-rata reduction will be applied based on the ratio of the Policy income to the total income from all sources. These rules are applicable throughout the period of disability and for a transitional period of up to 12 months following the end of the disability.
<EOS>
Under Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, an insured employee entitled to other income benefits is required to actively pursue them. For instance, if benefits under the federal Social Security Act are payable, the employee must apply promptly, request reconsideration upon denial, and seek a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (unless the company waives this in writing). Employers of such employees must cooperate when filing for Workers' Compensation or similar benefits. Failure to pursue other income benefits on time allows the company to either deny or suspend monthly benefits, or reduce them by an estimated amount.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 24 (row 27, 28, 30), an Insured Employee with a pending claim for Social Security or another Government Retirement Plan benefit must choose one of the following options in writing:

1. If no written election is made, the Monthly Benefits will be reduced according to Option 1. The reduction percentage varies based on the retirement plan: Social Security - 20%, other Government Retirement Plans - 50%.

The crucial date for making this decision is the later of the policy effective date or the date the Insured Employee turns age 62. The election remains in effect unless the Insured Employee provides written notice to change it.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the Insured Employee may receive reduced Monthly Benefits if they have estimated Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits. The Company will adjust Policy benefits and refund any underpayment, in a lump sum, upon receiving proof of either: a) the amount actually awarded or b) claim denial and completion of any required appeal by the Company. This adjustment and refund applies to rows [32-40] on page 24.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 24 and subsequent rows 42-48, the Insured Employee is eligible for unreduced monthly benefits pending a claim. However, if they receive Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits, they must promptly repay any overpayment in a lump sum. If an overpayment isn't repaid promptly, future payments may be reduced or eliminated, and the Minimum Monthly Benefit won't apply until the amount is repaid. Failure to do so could result in a reduction or elimination of future payments and a non-application of the Minimum Monthly Benefit until the overpayment is resolved.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, lump sum payments under Other Income Benefits are pro-rated monthly over the specified duration or a reasonable period not exceeding 60 months, whichever comes first. If no time period is provided, the company will continue its estimated monthly offset until the full amount is offset. If an estimated monthly offset wasn't being made, the lump sum is pro-rated over a reasonable period. No lump sum payment will exceed the Maximum Benefit Period.
<EOS>
In the specified sections of the Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf (pages 24 and 25, rows 62, 63, 1, 4, 5), it is detailed that after the initial deduction for all Other Income Benefits, except Earnings, the amount will be frozen. This means that further reductions to the Monthly Benefit due to cost-of-living increases under these Other Income Benefits are not applicable, as stated in GL3002-CERT-12 04 24 04/01/11. The freeze date is not explicitly mentioned, but the context suggests it begins after the initial deduction.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 25, rows 4, 5, and 7, a Recurrent Disability is defined as one that results from an Injury or Sickness that is identical or related to a prior Disability for which Monthly Benefits were already paid. To qualify as a Recurrent Disability, the current condition must match or be linked to a previous one for which benefits were disbursed. The policy does not specify a timeframe for when this recurrence can occur, but it is essential to note that if a Recurrent Disability arises, the original terms and conditions of the previous Disability will apply. Additionally, any payments made for the Recurrent Disability will be deducted from the Total Benefit Period remaining under the original policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, a recurrent disability is considered a new disability if the insured employee returns to their own occupation with the employer on a full-time basis working at least the minimum number of hours per week as shown in the Schedule of Benefits for six consecutive months or more following the end of prior disability benefits. A new elimination period must be completed before additional monthly benefits are paid, and a new maximum benefit period applies.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages [25, 26] details the Recurrent Disability provision. If an Insured Employee returns to their Own Occupation with the Employer for less than six months after prior Disability benefits end, any subsequent Disability is considered a Recurrent Disability. No new Elimination Period is required, and the same Maximum Benefit Period and Predisability Income apply.

If the Insured Employee does not return to work with the original Employer within six months following prior Disability benefits end, and other conditions are met (such as coverage termination or ineligibility for benefits under another group long-term disability plan), reinstated benefits will not require a new Elimination Period. The Maximum Benefit Period, Exclusions, Limitations, and Predisability Income remain the same.

To be eligible for Monthly Benefits, the Insured Employee must earn less than the specified percentage of Predisability Income in the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit section, with all other policy terms applying. The Recurrent Disability provision ceases to apply if the Insured Employee becomes eligible for coverage under another group long-term disability plan.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, on page 27, under row numbers 7 and 8, the ADL Benefit section outlines a daily living allowance payable upon meeting certain criteria. This benefit is triggered if an individual becomes unable to perform two Activities of Daily Living (ADL) without substantial assistance from another person or specialized equipment for a period exceeding 90 days. The amount paid will be a percentage of the base amount, which varies based on age, up to a maximum of $315 per day. Additionally, if an individual requires supervision to protect them from threats to their health and safety, this is also considered as one ADL. This benefit continues for the duration that these requirements persist, with adjustments made annually based on cost-of-living changes.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, an Insured Employee's coverage for Progressive Income Benefit under the policy becomes effective as follows:

1. If the Long Term Disability Benefits provision is already included in the Policy at the time of employment, the effective date is immediately upon hiring.
2. However, if this provision is added later by amending the Policy, the effective date for coverage will be specified in the amendment document. This amended provision will then govern any Progressive Income Benefit payments related to a disability occurring after the effective date stated in the amendment.
<EOS>
According to the Exception section in Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 26, rows 10-16, an Insured Employee's effective date for a specific benefit will be postponed if they are unable to perform all Activities of Daily Living without assistance or have a Cognitive Impairment on that date. The employee will become insured when they can safely and independently perform these activities or no longer suffer from the Cognitive Impairment.
<EOS>
Under the specified terms of Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, following the Elimination Period outlined in the insurance schedule, the company will provide an additional monthly benefit to the Insured Employee if they are currently receiving Total Disability or Partial Disability Monthly Benefits under the policy and submit proof of either a Loss of Activities of Daily Living or Cognitive Impairment (as defined). Proof of these conditions is at the employee's own expense.
<EOS>
This document (Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf) specifies the Progressive Income Benefit as equaling 10% of the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings, but not surpassing the Maximum Monthly Benefit for Long Term Disability Benefits or $5,000 per month (whichever is less), as shown in the Schedule of Insurance. This Progressive Income Benefit remains unaffected by any Other Income Benefits or earnings from employment.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the Progressive Income Benefit terminates upon the earliest occurrence of four scenarios: (1) the Insured Employee recovers from Loss of Activities of Daily Living or Cognitive Impairment as defined; (2) the cessation of Total Disability or Partial Disability Monthly Benefits under the Policy; (3) the end of the Maximum Benefit Period; or (4) the Insured Employee's demise. Notably, if a Family Income Benefit is included in the policy, payments to the Eligible Surviving Spouse or Children will not increase due to the Insured Employee receiving this Progressive Income Benefit.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the Loss of Activities of Daily Living policy pertains to an Insured Employee who, due to injury or sickness, can no longer perform two or more of the six daily activities independently and without substantial assistance from another person. The six activities include eating, toileting, transferring (e.g., moving from a bed to a chair), bathing, dressing, and continence. If an employee is unable to complete these tasks safely and fully, benefits may be triggered under this policy provision. This impairment must affect the employee significantly, such that they require assistance for most of the activity.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 26, row 60, personal bathing is defined as washing oneself in a tub, shower, or through sponge baths with or without equipment. The policy outlines that the insured can receive personal hygiene assistance, such as help in bathing and dressing, if deemed necessary by a healthcare professional. This service will be covered up to $10,000 per calendar year for home health care or $5,000 annually for residential respite care. The policy also specifies that the coverage applies only when provided by a licensed nurse, therapist, or other qualified professional.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 26, row numbers 62 and 63, the policy extends coverage to braces or artificial limbs routinely worn. The policy mandates that these items must be medically necessary for dress-related activities such as putting on, taking off, fastening, or unfastening garments. This applies to any reasonable adjustments made in accordance with medical advice and requirements.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on page 26, row 65, the policy covers assistance with toileting, including movement to and from, onto, and off the toilet, as well as related personal hygiene tasks. The policy provides coverage for these services up to a specific percentage, though this amount is not explicitly stated in the section. The policy also requires that any care provided meets professional standards and adheres to the individual's care plan. This provision applies from the policy's effective date forward.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, these provisions apply to mobility aids such as canes, walkers, crutches, grab bars, and mechanical or motorized devices for in-and-out bed, chair, or wheelchair transfers. The policy covers assistance devices needed due to sickness, injury, or physical limitation. It specifies that the policyholder is eligible for coverage up to a certain percentage depending on the nature of the disability or illness, as determined by the insurance company's assessment. Additionally, this section includes provisions for temporary and permanent use of mobility aids, with potential adjustments in coverage based on these factors. The policy provides clear guidelines regarding the duration and circumstances under which such equipment can be covered.
<EOS>
According to the Continence section in Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf (pages 26, rows 71-72), an individual's continence status is crucial for policy consideration. If one maintains control over bladder and bowel function, they are considered continent. However, if not, related personal hygiene, including catheter or colostomy bag care, becomes relevant. Importantly, these personal care needs may impact the policy's terms or conditions. The policy does not specify any specific durations or percentages regarding this requirement.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 26 and 27, under row numbers 74, 75, and 4, the policy defines nourishment as consuming food either from a table, tray, container (such as a bowl or cup), or with the aid of specialized equipment like feeding tubes or intravenous tubes. This implies that obtaining sustenance can occur through such methods to fulfill the policy's requirements.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, cognitive impairment in the insured employee is defined as a permanent deterioration or loss of cognitive or intellectual capacity due to injury or sickness. This requires another person's active help or verbal cues to prevent self or others from harm, resulting from conditions like moderate to severe head trauma, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, or other irreversible dementia. The diagnosis must be based on clinical evidence and reliable standardized tests of memory, orientation, and deductive reasoning. It is important to note that this definition applies only to the specified rows and page 27 of the document.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf outlines the definition of "Mental Sickness." It refers to emotional, behavioral, psychological, personality, or stress-related abnormalities that may not have a known cause. Included are conditions such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, bipolar affective disorder, manic depression, and various anxiety or depressive disorders, commonly treated by psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, or other mental health care providers via psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or similar treatment methods. However, it excludes irreversible dementia resulting from stroke, trauma, viral infection, Alzheimer's disease, and other conditions not typically managed using these treatment methods.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, a pre-existing condition is defined as any sickness or injury for which the insured received treatment within six months prior to their policy's effective date. Treatment encompasses physician consultations, care and services, diagnostic measures, and the prescription, refill, or ingestion of prescribed drugs or medicines. If you have sought such treatment before your coverage commencement, it may be considered a pre-existing condition and could potentially affect your policy's benefits or eligibility.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, page 27, row 40, if an insured individual has a pre-existing disability at the start of their coverage under this policy, benefits will not be payable during that period of disability. This applies only to disabilities that manifested prior to the employee's effective date of coverage. The policy does not cover any disability claims that are directly or indirectly related to such pre-existing conditions.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 27 and the subsequent rows 43-49, a pre-existing condition may affect the payable benefits for Loss of Activities of Daily Living or Cognitive impairment. This applies if the impairment is caused or worsened by a pre-existing condition within the first 12 months following the Insured Employee's effective date under this benefit. It's essential to note that any such impairment resulting from a pre-existing condition will not be covered during this period.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, on pages 27 and rows 52-54, disability benefits will not be paid if the disability is caused, contributed to, or results from mental illness, alcoholism, or voluntary use of a Controlled Substance as defined in Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, and any amendments thereafter. However, an exception applies if the Controlled Substance is prescribed by a Physician. These regulations pertain to your disability benefits eligibility.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the premium and other policy provisions are subject to the Definitions, Exclusions, Proof of Claim, and Waiver clauses detailed on pages [27, 28]. Premium payments must adhere to GL3002-CERT-13 10 MN 6/12 Pre-Ex stipulations effective from April 1, 2011. These provisions govern the entire policy's terms and conditions.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the policy excludes periods of Total or Partial Disability not covered due to:

1. War, declared or undeclared, or any act of war.
2. Self-inflicted injuries resulting from intentional actions.
3. Active participation in a riot.
4. The Insured Employee committing or attempting to commit a felony.
5. Disability periods when the Insured Employee is not receiving Regular Care from a Physician.
6. Disability occurring after the Insured Employee has resided outside the United States or Canada for over 12 consecutive months, excluding employment with the Employer.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf (pages 28 and 29) outlines the Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion. During the initial 12 months after the Insured Employee's Effective Date, any Total or Partial Disability caused or exacerbated by a Pre-Existing Condition will not be covered. However, if disability persists beyond the first 24 months, benefits will be payable for subsequent months. A "Pre-Existing Condition" is defined as a Sickness or Injury for which treatment was sought within 6 months prior to the Effective Date, encompassing consultations, care, services, diagnostic measures, and prescription drugs or medicines provided by a Physician. This exclusion may be removed if the Insured Employee's certificate has been amended accordingly. The policy also includes a Specified Limit (GL3002-CERT-14 98 Specified Limit).
<EOS>
This document, Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 29 and specific rows 4-11, outlines the limitations of disability benefits for an 'Insured Employee'. If a disability arises primarily from listed 'Specified Injuries or Sicknesses' such as Mental Sickness or Substance Abuse, monthly benefits will be payable according to policy terms but are limited to 24 months per disablement period. This limitation does not apply if the employee is hospital-confined. These 'Specified Injuries or Sicknesses' are defined within the document. The disability benefits duration may exceed 24 months for a hospitalized employee, with no specified limit in this case.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, if the Insured Employee remains hospitalized at the end of the 24th month following payment for a Specified Injury or Sickness, benefits will continue until discharge. However, these Monthly Benefits must not surpass the Maximum Benefit Period stated in the Schedule of Insurance. The policy does not provide coverage beyond this period.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 29 (rows 25-41), a 'Hospital' encompasses: general hospitals licensed, approved, or certified by their state; recognized by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Hospitals; treating resident inpatients with a registered nurse always on duty, a lab, x-ray facility, and major surgery capabilities. Also included are skilled nursing care facilities providing convalescent or nursing care under Medicare, mental hospitals for mental sickness treatment, and treatment centers for substance abuse treatment.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, a 'Mental Hospital' is defined as a state-licensed, certified, or approved facility in its location that accommodates resident mental disease or disorder patients. This healthcare institution must be equipped for inpatient treatment and maintains a resident psychiatrist on duty or call at all times. These facilities are found within the document's specified pages (29, rows 44-49).
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf describes "Mental Sickness" as any emotional, behavioral, psychological, or personality disorder or syndrome, regardless of its cause. Included are conditions like schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder, bipolar affective disorder, manic depression, psychosis, obsessive-compulsive, depressive, panic, and anxiety disorders. Treatment often involves psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or similar methods by a psychiatrist, clinical psychologist, or other mental health care provider. Exclusions are irreversible dementia from stroke, trauma, viral infection, Alzheimer's disease, or other conditions not typically treated with psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or similar treatment methods.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf (page numbers 29 and 30, rows 73 to 5), a "Treatment Center" refers to a state-licensed, certified, or approved healthcare facility or its medical/psychiatric unit that offers inpatient substance abuse treatment, overseen by a Physician via an approved and supervised written plan. This policy is relevant to GL3002-CERT-14.3 98 Voluntary Rehab, effective as of 04/01/11.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 30, rows 4-12, if an Insured Employee becomes Disabled and receives Policy benefits, they might be eligible for a Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit. This benefit includes vocational evaluation, counseling, training, or job placement; job modification or special equipment; and other necessary services to aid the employee's return to work. The Company has the authority to decide eligibility and the amount of any payable Benefit.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, an insured employee may be eligible for this benefit if they have a disability that prevents them from performing their regular occupation and lack the necessary skills, training, or experience for any other gainful occupation afterwards. They must also possess the physical and mental abilities needed to complete a Program and be reasonably expected to return to work after its completion, given their degree of motivation and labor force demand in the proposed occupation. The Company's determination requires that the employee's cost of services is less than its expected claim liability.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 30 and relevant rows 27-29, the Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit's maximum amount is contingent upon the Company's expectations. This benefit will not be applicable for services provided under the Insured Employee's health care plan or any other vocational rehabilitation program. Payments, should they occur, will be directed to the service provider at the Company's discretion.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645, during a vocational rehabilitation program approved by the company, the definition of Disability is waived during the rehabilitation period. Upon program completion, the policy's Disability definition resumes. The company decides any Long Term Disability benefits amount and duration after the program ends. These provisions are found on pages 30, rows 32, 33, and 34 of the document.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 30, row 37, if an insured employee receives a Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit, they will not be covered for any disability period should they fail to complete the program without substantial justification (i.e., good cause). This provision applies only to this specific benefit and its associated requirements.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4553645 document on page [30] outlines the definition of 'Good Cause'. It includes three main scenarios where this term applies:

1. If an Insured Employee has documented physical or mental impairments, preventing them from participating in or completing a Program.
2. When the Insured Employee is involved in a medical program that hinders their ability to participate in or complete a Program.
3. In case the Insured Employee participates in another vocational rehabilitation program in good faith. This other program must either conflict with a Program developed by the Company, and be reasonably expected to return the employee to work, or it should be one that the Insured Employee is taking part in good faith, which conflicts with completing a Program established by the Company.
<EOS>
This document, Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 30 and 31, outlines that a 'Program' refers to a vocational rehabilitation plan developed collaboratively by the insurance company, the insured employee, their physician, and any suitable employer. The Program sets specific goals, assigns responsibilities to each party, details rehabilitation service timelines, dates, and costs.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4553645 document outlines the Reasonable Accommodation Benefit on page 31, rows [3-24]. If an Insured Employee of the Employer is Disabled and receiving benefits, the Employer may be eligible for reimbursement of up to 50% of the cost for reasonable accommodation services, limited to $5,000 per employee or the Company's expected liability for the employee's Long Term Disability claim (whichever is less). Eligible services include making workspaces more accessible, removing barriers, providing specialized equipment, offering training materials in alternative formats, and other necessary accommodations to aid an Insured Employee's return to work with their employer.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, an employer is eligible for the Benefit if they have an insured employee whose disability prevents them from performing their regular occupation at the worksite but can do so with proposed accommodation. The employee must also possess the necessary physical and mental abilities for their own or another occupation at the worksite, contingent on accommodation. Furthermore, the employee should be reasonably expected to return to work with the help of the proposed accommodation. Lastly, the Company must find that the cost of the Reasonable Accommodation Benefit is less than the anticipated liability for the Insured Employee's Long Term Disability claim.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the written proposal for reasonable accommodation services should be collaboratively developed among the Employer, Insured Employee, and their Physician when needed. The proposal must clearly specify the purpose of the proposed accommodation, as well as the dates, times, and costs associated with these services. These details are essential in ensuring the proper implementation of the requested accommodations.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf pages 31 and 32, the Company, Employer, Insured Employee, or their Physician can propose an accommodation for the employee. The proposal must be approved in writing by the Company. Once approved, the Company will reimburse the Employer upon receipt of proof that they have provided services for the employee and paid the service provider. This process is subject to GL3002-CERT-15 99 guidelines.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, in case of a transfer of insurance carriers to prevent coverage loss for an Employee, the Policy offers Prior Insurance Credit. This credit is based on the employee's coverage under the previous carrier's policy on its termination date. The amount of credit is proportional to the time elapsed between the effective dates of both policies, up to a maximum of 100%. For instance, if the new and old policies have a three-month difference, the Employee would receive a 75% Prior Insurance Credit (3 months out of 4). This credit can significantly reduce the premiums for the new policy.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4553645 policy provides coverage for employees who were insured by the previous carrier upon transfer and were not actively-at-work due to injury or sickness on the policy's effective date. The coverage resembles that of the previous policy, if it had continued. The company pays the benefit amount that the prior carrier would have paid, minus any liability amount assumed by the prior carrier. This coverage is subject to premium payments and is found on Lincoln Cert 4553645 pages 32, rows 7-18.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf section (rows 21-44 on page 32) outlines disability benefits due to a pre-existing condition. If an employee was insured under the prior carrier's policy at the time of transfer and actively-at-work on the new policy's effective date, the following applies:

  1. The Policy's Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion will be applied, and benefits may be paid according to the Policy's benefit schedule if the Insured Employee qualifies.

  2. If the Insured Employee cannot satisfy the Policy's Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion but can demonstrate continuous insurance under both policies, benefits will be paid in accordance with the less restrictive of the two policies' benefit schedules, terms, conditions, and limitations.

  3. If the Insured Employee fails to meet either policy's Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion, no benefits will be awarded.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf section on row 3, 6, and 7 of page 33 outlines the Three Month Survivor Benefit. Upon your insured's death, if they were less than age 60 at policy inception, the beneficiary will receive 100% of the monthly benefit for three months following the death. The monthly benefit is calculated as GL3002-CERT-16 multiplied by 0.42. This benefit ceases after the three-month period or upon remarriage of the beneficiary, whichever occurs first. The effective date for this coverage is April 1, 2011.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 33 and 34, the Family Income Benefit is a lump sum payment made to the Eligible Survivor upon proof of an Insured Employee's death. The death must occur after 180 consecutive days of Disability and while receiving a Monthly Benefit. The benefit equals three times the Last Monthly Benefit, which is the gross Monthly Benefit the Insured Employee received immediately prior to death. No reductions will apply for Other Income Benefits or earnings from Partial Disability Employment. An Eligible Survivor can be the Insured Employee's surviving spouse, or if none, the Insured Employee's children under 25 at the date of death. If multiple children are eligible, they will receive equal shares. If necessary, payments to children may be made to a designated representative on their behalf, with this payment being valid and effective against all claims. The GL3002-CERT-39-FC MN 33 04/01/11 document provides these details.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the insurance company will reimburse an insured employee's family care expenses under specific conditions. These include when the employee is receiving either a Partial Disability Monthly Benefit or a Total Disability Benefit under the policy. If the employee is terminally ill, has suffered cognitive impairment, or has experienced a loss of activities of daily living, they are eligible for this Family Care Expense Benefit. This benefit supplements all other policy benefits and is not reduced by Other Income Benefits.
<EOS>
Under Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the Insured Employee must submit monthly proof of Family Care Expenses for their Dependent. The proof should include the Dependent's name, age, reason (if age exceeds defined Dependent limit), care dates, total charges, payments, provider details such as name, address, phone number, and either Federal Employer Identification Number or Taxpayer Identification Number. If a dependent's age surpasses the defined Dependent maximum, a justification for their care is required.
<EOS>
According to the Family Care Expense Benefit outlined in Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 34, row 40, eligible dependents can receive up to $250 per month for unreimbursed care expenses. This benefit is available only if the expenses are not covered by other sources.
<EOS>
According to the Family Care Expense Benefit section of Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, this benefit will terminate on one of the following occasions: when the Insured Employee's Total or Partial Disability Benefits under the policy conclude; if an Insured Employee's Dependents no longer comply with the dependent definition in this provision; or after the Company has made 12 consecutive monthly payments for Family Care Expense Benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the term 'Child' encompasses the Insured Employee's biological child, legally adopted child, stepchild, foster child, or any child for whom the employee serves as legal guardian. Eligibility for coverage extends to these children under the policy's provisions. The specific row and page numbers can be found on page 34, row 54.
<EOS>
According to the Cognitive Impairment definition in Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf (pages 34-35), an Insured Employee or Dependent with a permanent loss or deterioration of cognitive capacity requires active assistance or verbal cues to avoid self-harm or harming others, due to the impairment. The diagnosis must be made by a Physician based on clinical evidence and standardized tests assessing memory, orientation, and reasoning. This condition may stem from moderate to severe head trauma, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, or other irreversible dementia (GL3002-CERT-39-FC MN 34 04/01/11).
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, a 'Dependent' is defined as the Insured Employee's legal spouse (if living with and incapable of independent living due to a mental or physical condition), children under 16, unmarried children 16 years or older who live with the employee and are also incapable of independent living due to such conditions, parents or parent-in-law living with and incapable of independent living, or a sibling living with and incapable of independent living. All dependents must be unable to live independently due to mental or physical conditions.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 35 and relevant row numbers 33-37, 'Family Care Expense' refers to costs incurred for the care of a Dependent by a licensed provider. Notably, this Dependent must not be a member of the Insured Employee's immediate family nor reside in their home. This expense coverage is applicable for non-family members requiring care, subject to the terms and conditions outlined within the policy document.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the term "Incapable of Independent Living" applies to a Dependent who meets one or more criteria: being Terminally Ill, suffering from Cognitive Impairment, experiencing Loss of Activities of Daily Living, or having a disability that prevents self-sustaining employment (developmental, mental, or physical), while chiefly dependent on the Insured Employee for support and maintenance. Such a Dependent may qualify under this policy if they are unable to work due to their condition.
<EOS>
According to the "Loss of Activities of Daily Living" section in Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, an insured employee or dependent is considered eligible if they cannot perform at least two out of six essential daily activities without substantial assistance from another person. These activities include eating, bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring (moving from one place to another), and continence (managing bodily waste). The inability to perform these tasks safely and independently is grounds for coverage. This loss must affect the individual's ability to carry out these functions nearly completely.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, bathing is defined as washing oneself in a tub, shower, or via a sponge bath with or without equipment on row 61 of page 35. The policy covers bathing incidents under the personal accident section, providing coverage up to a specified limit for eligible accidents. Additionally, the policy excludes self-inflicted injuries and pre-existing conditions, as stated in the exclusions section. This coverage is subject to terms, conditions, and limitations outlined in the policy document.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, under the 'Dressing' section on pages 35 and rows 63-64, artificial limbs or braces that are regularly worn are considered for coverage. These prosthetic devices should be put on, taken off, fastened, or unfastened as medically necessary. The policy does not specify any specific timeframe or percentage for these actions.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4553645 policy detail on Page 35, Row 66 concerns toileting activities, including getting to, from, and on/off the toilet, as well as related personal hygiene. The policy provides coverage for any loss or damage arising from inability to perform these tasks due to accidental bodily injury or sickness, up to a specified daily limit and lifetime maximum. Exclusions apply for pre-existing conditions and certain chronic illnesses, with specific provisions regarding waiver of elimination periods under certain circumstances. The policy also outlines requirements for medical evaluation and documentation to substantiate claims related to toileting impairment.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, under the Transferring section on pages 35 and rows 68-70, the policy covers mobility aids such as canes, walkers, crutches, grab bars, or mechanical/motorized devices when moving in and out of bed, chairs, or wheelchairs. The usage of these aids may be subject to certain conditions, and approval is required for any equipment modifications or additions. The policy also specifies that benefits will be adjusted if the use of such devices reduces the beneficiary's qualification for the total disability benefit classification. Additionally, the policy outlines that the beneficiary must meet specific functionality requirements to maintain eligibility for this coverage.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 35, rows 72-73, the continuence clause pertains to maintaining bladder and bowel control or using necessary care for catheters or colostomy bags if one is not continent.
