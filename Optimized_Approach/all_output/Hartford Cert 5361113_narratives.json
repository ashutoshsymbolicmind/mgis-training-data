However, the Dependent Amount of Insurance will be the lesser of the Amount of Life Insurance and the accidental death and dismemberment principal sum: 1) they had under the Prior Policy; or 2) shown in the Schedule of Insurance; reduced by any coverage amount: 1) that is in force, paid or payable under the Prior Policy; or 2) that would have been so payable under the Prior Policy had timely election been made.",
        "narrative": "According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf document on pages [45, 46], continuity of coverage is granted for both the policyholder and dependents under a new policy. If the policyholder was insured under the previous policy but not actively at work on the Participating Employer Effective Date, their initial coverage will begin without deferral, with the amount of insurance being the lesser of what they had in the prior policy or shown in the Schedule of Insurance. For dependents, if covered under the previous policy on the day before the Participating Employer Effective Date, the Deferred Effective Date provision does not apply for their initial coverage. However, the dependent amount of insurance will also be the lesser of what they had in the prior policy or shown in the Schedule of Insurance, reduced by any coverage amounts that are in force, paid, or payable under the prior policy, or would have been so payable if a timely election were made. The reduced amount is subject to the critical date of the Participating Employer Effective Date."

A Motor Vehicle, meanwhile, refers to self-propelled, four-wheeled vehicles such as private passenger cars, station wagons, vans, sport utility vehicles, motor homes or campers, and pick-up trucks, but excludes farm equipment, snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles, lawnmowers, and other types of equipment vehicles. The definition does not consider a Motor Vehicle as a Common Carrier unless it is being used for such purposes. These definitions are applicable on the policyholder's insurance coverage."
