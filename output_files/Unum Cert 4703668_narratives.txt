According to Unum Cert 4703668, page 4 row 18, only active U.S. Employees (excluding Physicians) are eligible for this insurance policy. This applies to employees of the specified employer in the United States.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, section on page 4 row 22, eligibility for insurance benefits requires employees to work a minimum of 30 hours per week. This policy does not specify any exceptions or partial eligibility, making the full-time status mandatory for coverage under this plan.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, for employees who were part of an eligible group before June 1, 1998, there's no waiting period requirement. However, for employees joining an eligible group after this date, a waiting period of 30 days of continuous active employment is applicable.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on pages 4 (rows 33, 34), if your employment terminates and you are rehired within a year, any prior work performed while part of an eligible group will contribute towards meeting the waiting period. All other policy provisions apply in this scenario. The waiting period refers to the duration before benefits are activated, typically following a qualifying event such as disability or illness.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, your employer covers the cost of your insurance. Employer payments begin on the effective date specified in your policy, and you are responsible for paying any premium increases should they occur. The coverage level is subject to the terms and conditions outlined within the policy document.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on page 4, the elimination period for Short Term Disability benefits is either 180 days or the end date of your insured STD payments, whichever comes later. Benefits commence following the completion of this period, starting the day after it ends.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on pages 4 and rows 51, 53, 54, this policy provides a monthly benefit equal to 60% of your earnings, capped at $15,000. Your payments may be affected by deductible sources of income and disability earnings. However, certain disabilities might not be covered or have limited coverage under this plan.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, the maximum period of payment for disability benefits is determined by the age at which disability occurs:

   - If disabled before age 62, benefits continue until age 67. The duration ranges from 60 months (age 62) to 24 months (age 67).
   - From ages 62 to 68, the duration decreases incrementally from 60 months to 18 months.
   - For ages 69 and above, the duration is 12 months.
   Notably, no premium payments are required during periods when benefits are being received under this plan. The B@G-LTD-2 policy was effective as of 6/27/2012.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, under the Other Features section on page 5 row 10, the policy offers Continuity of Coverage. This provision ensures that if you become disabled during the initial benefit period and your disability continues beyond this timeframe, your benefits will automatically renew for subsequent periods without interruption, provided you continue to meet eligibility requirements. The maximum duration of this coverage is up to the Benefit Maximum Period specified in your policy schedule. Additionally, any pre-existing conditions may have a waiting period before becoming eligible for benefits under this provision.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on page 5, row 16, pre-existing conditions are subject to a 3/12 provision. This means that if you have a condition that was diagnosed, treated, or experienced symptoms within the 12 months prior to your policy's effective date, it will be considered pre-existing for the first 3 months of coverage. During this period, benefits may only be paid for complications directly resulting from the treatment received for the pre-existing condition. After the 3-month period, normal benefit payments resume, subject to the terms and conditions of the policy.
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 4703668.pdf (rows 20-25 on pages 5 and 6) outlines the Survivor Benefit aspect of your coverage under the Employer's Benefit Program. The plan encompasses enrollment, risk management services, and other related support. It's important to note that for a comprehensive understanding, you should refer to the entire certificate of coverage. Your Employer will provide either an electronic or paper copy at no cost upon request. LTD-CLM-1 (6/27/2012) underscores this section. The plan does not disclose all features here, so always consult your certificate for precise details.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, it's essential to notify Unum of a disability claim as soon as possible for timely processing. Written notice should be sent within 30 days after your disability starts, and proof of claim must be provided no later than 90 days after the elimination period. If providing proof within 90 days isn't feasible, it should be given no later than one year from the required date, except in cases of legal incapacity. The claim form can be obtained from your employer or requested directly from Unum. If you don't receive the form within 15 days of your request, send written proof of claim without waiting for the formal form. Remember to inform Unum immediately if you return to work in any capacity.
<EOS>
To file a claim under Unum Cert 4703668, both you and your employer are required to complete respective sections of the provided claim form. Upon completion, pass the form to your attending physician who must then fill out their section before directly sending it to Unum. This process ensures the swift assessment of your claim.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, your disability claim requires the following proof, all at your expense: evidence of regular physician care, documentation of monthly earnings, start date of disability, cause of disability, extent with related restrictions and limitations preventing your regular occupation, treatment hospital/institution details, and attending physicians' names and addresses. Proof of continuing disability should be submitted within 45 days if requested, and additional medical or non-medical information might be required. Failure to provide necessary details may lead to claim denial or halted payments.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on pages 6 and 7, row numbers 1 and 2, the policy stipulates that payments will be made directly to you under LTD-CLM-2 (issued on 6/27/2012).

The policy details may vary, so it is essential to review the complete document for specific terms and conditions.
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 4703668 document outlines the repayment of overpayments due to instances of fraud, errors in claim processing, or receipt of deductible sources of income. If an overpayment occurs, you are required to reimburse Unum fully. The repayment method will be determined by Unum, and they will not recover more money than what was initially paid out to you. It is essential to note that Unum will only seek recovery for the amount that has been overpaid.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, this certificate of coverage serves as a declaration providing essential details about your potential entitlements. It outlines who the payment recipient is, along with the limitations, exclusions, and prerequisites within the plan that may apply. These parameters are designed to define the scope and conditions of your insurance coverage.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, eligibility for coverage is contingent upon your employment in a qualified group. The eligibility date is determined as the later of two scenarios: either the plan's effective date or the day following the completion of your waiting period. This means that if the plan has already begun and you meet the necessary requirements, you will be covered from the plan's start date. However, if you have not yet completed your waiting period when the plan begins, coverage will commence on the day after you fulfill this requirement.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, your coverage begins under the following conditions: If your employer fully covers your plan, you're insured from 12:01 a.m. on the eligibility date. When costs are shared or self-paid, coverage starts at 12:01 a.m., either on the eligibility date if an application is submitted beforehand, within 31 days post-eligibility, or upon approval, should evidence of insurability be necessary. Evidence of insurability is required if you're a late applicant (more than 31 days past eligibility) or reapplying after voluntary cancellation. An evidence of insurability form can be acquired from your employer.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, if you are unable to work due to injury, illness, temporary layoff or leave of absence, your coverage begins on the date you resume active employment. This means that your policy does not provide benefits during these periods of absence, but starts once you return to work actively.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on pages 8, rows 1-3, if you experience a temporary layoff and continue premium payments, your coverage will extend through the month immediately following the one during which your temporary leave commences.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on pages 9, rows 1-3, during a leave of absence, coverage is maintained up until the month that directly follows the one in which your leave begins, as long as premiums are paid.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, increased or additional coverage takes effect immediately if you are in active employment, on a covered layoff, or leave of absence. If absent due to injury or sickness, the new coverage starts on your return to work. Decreased coverage becomes effective immediately without affecting existing claims. Any adjustments made to your coverage do not apply retroactively.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, your insurance coverage ends on the earliest of these events: the policy or plan being cancelled; you leaving an eligible group; the cessation of coverage for your group; the last day of any required contributions period; or the day you cease active employment (except during covered layoff or leave of absence). Unum will cover payable claims that occur while you are still insured under the policy or plan.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, you may initiate legal action regarding your claim between 60 days following the proof of claim submission and up to three years from when the proof of claim is required. Federal law exceptions may apply. This timeframe for legal proceedings pertains to your claim.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, any statements made by you or your employer during the signed application process for coverage are considered representations rather than warranties. If these statements prove incomplete or untrue at the time they're submitted, Unum reserves the right to either reduce or deny any claim, or cancel the policy from its original effective date. Information obtained from a signed application will be used as the basis for such actions, but this cannot be done if the coverage has been active for at least two years. However, if the employer provides incorrect information about you, Unum will assess whether your coverage complies with the plan's provisions and in what amounts. This policy applies to the rows [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16] on page number [9].
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, on page 10 row 1, there is a provision for adjusting the premium fairly. This adjustment may be necessary when the actual experience of claimants differs from the original assumptions made during policy issuance. The adjustment percentage will depend on the specifics of each case and may result in either an increase or decrease in the premium. It's important to note that this provision is subject to the terms and conditions of the policy and any applicable laws. This adjustment process could potentially take place at specified review periods, such as every three years.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, the company takes insurance fraud seriously and vows to employ all reasonable means for detection, investigation, and possible prosecution. It is unlawful to intentionally deceive or mislead Unum by submitting false, incomplete, or misleading information, including while filing a claim. Engaging in such practices will lead to claim denial, with potential legal consequences under state and federal law. The company reserves the right to pursue appropriate legal action if insurance fraud is detected.
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 4703668 policy does not replace or supersede the necessity for coverage by any workers' compensation or state disability insurance. The policy operates independently of such programs. Specifically, it does not affect your entitlement to state disability benefits in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, your employer acts either on its own behalf or as your representative in the context of this policy. Under no circumstances will they be considered Unum's agent. This clarification was made on June 27, 2012.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, disability is defined as: a determination that you're unable to perform the material and substantial duties of your regular occupation due to sickness or injury, coupled with a 20% or more loss in indexed monthly earnings because of the same condition. After 24 months of payments, disability is also defined as being unable to perform any gainful occupation for which you're reasonably fitted by education, training or experience, again due to the same sickness or injury. The loss of a professional or occupational license or certification doesn't automatically classify you as disabled. Unum may require examinations by physicians, medical practitioners, or vocational experts at their discretion and pay for these evaluations. They can request examinations as frequently as necessary. Additionally, an authorized Unum Representative may interview you during this process.
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 4703668.pdf information on pages 15 and 16 indicates that if you qualify for benefits under items 1, 2, and 3 in the deductible sources of income section, your Long Term Disability payment may be estimated and reduced unless you apply for these benefits, appeal any denial to all necessary administrative levels, and sign Unum's payment option form (LTD-BEN-6 from June 27, 2012). An overpayment adjustment will occur when proof of awarded amounts or completed appeals is provided. If an estimated amount reduction applies, your payment will be readjusted upon receipt of such proof, with a potential lump sum refund to you. Any received lump sum from deductible sources will be prorated monthly over the given time period, using a reasonable one if none is stated.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, if you meet the definition of disability, you can satisfy your elimination period while working. The elimination period is waived if your disability starts within 90 days after your insurance effective date or within 24 months following any prior coverage termination. If your disability begins later than 90 days after your effective date or more than 24 months since the previous policy termination, you must be off work for at least 14 consecutive days before benefits commence. The length of the elimination period is determined by the type of work you are performing during the disability. For example, if you're working full-time in your own occupation, the elimination period is 30 days; if you're working part-time in your own occupation, it's 60 days. If you're not engaged in any gainful activity, the elimination period is waived altogether.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, payments will commence upon approval of your claim, subject to the elimination period being fulfilled and if you are deemed disabled. The monthly payments will be issued for any period where Unum assumes liability. This policy is active until further notice, with no specified end date.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on pages 11 and 12, row numbers 1, 2, and 3, the payment amount for disability benefits follows LTD-BEN-2 (effective as of 6/27/2012). The benefit is calculated based on your monthly earnings at the time of policy issue, up to a maximum of 60% of such earnings. For any subsequent changes in employment or occupation, the calculation considers a new base amount determined by your most recent earnings. If your benefits exceed the Social Security Disability Benefits (SSDI) you're entitled to, Unum will adjust the payment accordingly. The reduction is applied progressively, starting from the dollar amount equal to the difference between the two benefits.
<EOS>
Under Unum Cert 4703668, your monthly disability payment is determined by comparing two amounts stated in Item 1 of the policy. The lesser amount serves as your gross disability payment. This comparison occurs on page 12, row 4. It's essential to note that the duration and conditions of these payments will be governed by the terms and provisions of the entire policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf (page 12, row 7), your monthly disability payment amount is the figure determined in Item 4. It's important to note that any deductible sources of income will be subtracted from this payment. This means if you receive other forms of income during your disability, they may affect the amount you receive under this policy. Always ensure accurate reporting of all income sources to avoid potential discrepancies and potential impact on your benefits.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on page 12 (rows 1-6), your "Monthly Earnings" refers to the gross income from your employer before disability, inclusive of all earnings before taxes. Excluded are commission, bonus, overtime pay, and any additional compensation, as well as income sourced elsewhere. However, pre-tax contributions towards a qualified deferred compensation plan, Section 125 plan, or flexible spending account are not included in this calculation. The total income under consideration is prior to such deductions.
<EOS>
During a covered layoff or leave of absence as defined by Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, if you experience disability, your monthly earnings during the period will be based on your pre-absence employer salary. Specifically, we will use your employer's wage at the time your leave or absence begins. This means that we will consider this income when determining your benefit amount. It is essential to note that this provision applies only to situations covered under the terms of this policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on page 12, if you are disabled due to the same sickness or injury and your monthly disability earnings are less than 20% of your indexed monthly earnings, we will send you a monthly payment. If your disability earnings equal or exceed 20%, your payment will be calculated with the following condition: During the first 12 months while working, your payment won't be reduced as long as the combined disability earnings and gross disability payment don't surpass 100% of indexed monthly earnings.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on pages 12 (rows 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23), if the response from Item 1 is equal to or less than 100% of your indexed monthly earnings, your monthly payment will not be further reduced. However, if it exceeds 100%, Unum will deduct the excess percentage from your payment. After 12 months of payments while working, you'll receive payments based on the disability-induced income loss percentage.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf (page 12, row 27), the policy provides a percentage of your lost earnings. Specifically, this percentage is calculated by dividing the benefit amount by your indexed monthly earnings. It's essential to note that the percentage varies depending on your occupation and age at the time of disability. The benefit period may extend up to your retirement age or for five years, whichever is longer. Additionally, there are specified maximum and minimum percentages set within the policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on page [13], the monthly payment amount you receive from Unum during disability will be multiplied by the value in Item 2. For the first 24 months of payments, if your disability earnings exceed 80% of your indexed monthly earnings, Unum may cease payments and terminate your claim. After 24 months, if your disability earnings surpass the gross disability payment, your payments will also stop and your claim will end. Proof of your monthly disability earnings must be provided at least quarterly, with adjustments made to your payment based on these reports. Financial records may be required for this purpose. If disabled for less than a month, you will receive 1/30 of the payment for each day of disability.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on page 13, if your disability earnings fluctuate significantly month-to-month, they may average the last three months' earnings to decide whether to continue your claim. Your claim will not be terminated unless, within the first 24 months of payments, the 3-month average surpasses 80% of indexed monthly earnings, or after 24 months, if it exceeds the gross disability payment. Payments are not made for any month where disability earnings exceed the plan's allowable amount.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, certain income sources may be deducted from your gross disability payment. These deductible incomes include: (1) any disability or long-term disability benefits you receive from another source, (2) Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) payments, and (3) Workers' Compensation, public disability benefits, or other governmental disability programs, if those benefits are payable due to the same impairment for which you are receiving Unum benefits. It is essential to note that the total amount deducted from your gross disability payment will not exceed 85% of your earnings prior to the disability. Additionally, Unum may require proof of these deductible income sources and their amounts.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf at pages 13, rows 6, 7, and 8, the benefits you're eligible for include those stipulated by workers' compensation laws, occupational disease laws, or any other legislation with similar intent. These benefits are subject to a maximum percentage of your pre-disability earnings, specifically 2/3rds for total disability and 66 2/3rds for partial disability. The policy duration is until you reach retirement age or the end of the benefit period, whichever comes first. Importantly, any changes in your work status or earnings during this time may affect your benefits. Additionally, the policy requires regular updates on any changes to workers' compensation or occupational disease laws that might impact your entitlements.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on pages 13 and 14, your disability income payments will not include benefits from any state compulsory benefit act or law, other group insurance plans, or governmental retirement systems associated with your employer. This excludes LTD-BEN-4 (effective from 6/27/2012). Your disability income is also unaffected by any governmental retirement system benefits resulting from your employment.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, disability payments you, your spouse, and children might receive or be entitled to stem from various sources. These include the United States Social Security Act, the Canada Pension Plan, and the Quebec Pension Plan. Any similar plans or acts are also applicable. Notably, these payments may be affected if benefits are received under any of these mentioned plans or acts. For instance, if you receive disability payments due to a disability under the United States Social Security Act, your monthly benefit amount will be reduced by 50% for each month that disability payments begin before age 60, with a maximum reduction of 65%. Similarly, if disability benefits are received from the Canada Pension Plan or Quebec Pension Plan prior to age 65, a 2/3 reduction in your Unum disability payment applies. This reduction continues until you reach age 65 or the cessation of CPP or QPP benefits, whichever is sooner.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on page 14, if you receive retirement payments from the United States Social Security Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the Quebec Pension Plan, or any comparable plan or act, your retirement benefits may be reduced due to these sources of income. The reduction percentage varies based on the specific plan and the time at which you begin receiving both types of payments. This reduction does not apply if you are under 65 when your disability benefit starts. In addition, if your children or dependents receive retirement payments, this will not affect their eligibility for benefits under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, disability payments under your employer's retirement plan are defined as benefits paid due to disability that do not affect the retirement benefit if no disability had occurred. These payments will be based on your employer's contributions to the retirement plan and will be considered alongside your own contributions throughout your lifetime. Retirement payments consist of benefits derived from the retirement plan, including those reducing the disability benefit under the plan.

The retirement funds will not include amounts rolled over or transferred to any eligible retirement plan as defined by Section 402 of the Internal Revenue Code. Unum will consider these funds distributed simultaneously throughout your lifetime, regardless of how they are distributed. Retirement benefits will be received when reaching either age 62 or the normal retirement age as defined in your employer's retirement plan.

This information emphasizes that Unum will use the definition of an eligible retirement plan from Section 402 of the Internal Revenue Code, including any future amendments affecting the definition.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on pages 14 and 15, under the Jones Act, Unum will only deduct earnings from sources that are directly related to your disability, excluding retirement payments. If your disability onset occurs after age 65 and you were already receiving Social Security retirement income, your LTD payment will not be affected. This policy was updated on 6/27/2012 (LTD-BEN-5).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, the following income sources will not be subtracted from your gross disability payment: 401(k) plans, profit sharing plans, thrift plans, tax-sheltered annuities, stock ownership plans, non-qualified deferred compensation plans, pension plans for partners, military pensions and disability income plans, credit disability insurance, franchise disability income plans, retirement plans from another employer, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), individual disability income plans, no-fault motor vehicle plans, salary continuation or accumulated sick leave plans.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, the minimum monthly payment under the minimum benefit provision is either $100 or 10% of your gross disability payment. This amount can be applied toward any outstanding overpayment. In other words, if your gross disability payment is less than $1000, you will pay the greater of $100 or 10% of that payment.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on pages 15, rows 1-3, any deductible income sources will be subtracted from your total disability payment. However, Unum will not subsequently adjust the payment due to a cost of living increase originating from that specific source. This means that while your payment might be reduced by this initial deduction, it will not continue to be affected by future cost of living adjustments stemming from the same income source.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, disability payment duration depends on the age at disability. For individuals younger than 62, payments continue until age 67; with 60 months maximum. Those aged 62 receive payments for 60 months, while those aged 63 get 48 months. The duration reduces to 42 months for ages 64 and 36 months for ages 65, followed by 30 months at age 66 and 24 months at age 67. For individuals aged 68 or older, payments continue for 18 months, while those over 69 receive 12 months.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, payments under this policy will cease on the earliest occasion of:

1. During the initial 24 months, if you can work part-time in your regular occupation but choose not to.
2. After 24 months, if you can engage in any part-time gainful occupation and opt not to.
3. The expiration of the maximum payment period.
4. The point at which you no longer meet the plan's disability definition.
5. Your failure to provide proof of continued disability.
6. When your disability earnings surpass the plan's allowable limit.
7. Upon your death.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, disabilities resulting from sickness or injury primarily based on self-reported symptoms, as well as those due to mental illness, have a limited pay period of up to 24 months under the policy. However, payments will continue beyond this period if you meet either of the following conditions: (1) You are unable to perform any gainful occupation, or (2) You are unable to perform the material and substantial duties of your Own Occupation as defined in the policy, for the first 24 months.

According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on pages 17, rows 6-14, if you are confined in a hospital or institution at the end of the 24-month period, payments will continue during your confinement. If still disabled upon discharge, additional payments will be made for up to 90 days as a recovery period. During this time, any subsequent reconfinement for at least 14 consecutive days triggers further payments during that confinement and an additional 90-day recovery period. This policy applies only once during the recovery period.
<EOS>
This information from Unum Cert 4703668.pdf specifies that if you continue to be disabled past the initial 24-month payment period and are subsequently hospitalized for at least 14 consecutive days, payments will continue during your reconfinement. However, payments will not exceed the specified limited pay period or the maximum duration of payment, whichever comes first. Notably, Unum does not apply the mental illness limitation to dementia resulting from stroke, trauma, viral infection, Alzheimer's disease, or other conditions not typically treated by a mental health provider using psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or similar methods.
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 4703668 policy does not cover disabilities resulting from intentionally self-inflicted injuries, active participation in a riot, loss of a professional or occupational license/certification, commission of a crime for which conviction is under state or federal law, or pre-existing conditions. The policy also does not provide coverage due to war (declared or undeclared), any act of war, or during periods of incarceration. This information is presented on pages [17, 18] with relevant row numbers [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 2, 3]. (LTD-BEN-8, 6/27/2012)

According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, a pre-existing condition is identified if, within the three months prior to your policy's effective date: you sought medical treatment, consulted healthcare providers, underwent diagnostic measures, took prescribed drugs or medicines; or you experienced symptoms severe enough that an ordinarily prudent person would have consulted a health professional. If a disability occurs during the first 12 months after your coverage starts, it may be considered as a result of this pre-existing condition.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, if your disability recurs within six months following the end of a prior claim and you have continuous coverage under the plan during this period, your recurrent disability will be considered an extension of the previous claim, bypassing the elimination period requirement. The terms for your recurrent disability will match those of your prior claim. Conversely, any disability that occurs more than six months after the end of your prior claim will be treated as a new claim, subject to all policy provisions. It is important to note that if you become entitled to payments under another group long term disability plan, you will not receive benefits from this Unum plan. This information can be found on pages 18 and 19, rows 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 2, 3 of the document.

This Unum policy (Cert 4703668) provides a lump-sum survivor benefit to an eligible survivor if the policyholder dies, having met the 180 consecutive day disability requirement. The benefit is equal to three months of the policyholder's gross disability payment, payable only when receiving or entitled to receive plan payments at the time of death. If no eligible survivors exist, the payment goes to the estate; otherwise, any overpayment on the claim will be first addressed. No benefits are distributed if there is no estate. The policy does not make a payment in case of no surviving relatives or estate.

Under Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, if your policy becomes effective and you are not employed due to illness or injury while previously covered by another policy (page 19, rows 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10), Unum will provide coverage. Coverage is contingent on premium payment, with the amount limited to what the previous carrier would have paid. Unum may reduce your payment by any liability of the prior carrier. Essentially, continuity of coverage is ensured subject to these conditions.
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 4703668.pdf section clarifies the conditions under which payments are made for disabilities arising from pre-existing conditions when your employer switches insurance carriers to Unum. If you were: (1) in active employment and insured on its effective date, and (2) insured by the previous policy at the time of change, you may receive a payment. This requires satisfying either the Unum plan's pre-existing condition provision or that of the prior carrier's, with benefits paid according to the respective plans.

The lesser of the two monthly benefits will be paid: (a) as per the terms of the prior policy had it remained in force or (b) as provided under the Unum plan. Your benefits terminate on the earlier date: (1) at the end of the plan's maximum benefit period, or (2) the date they would have ended under the prior policy if it hadn't changed. This information pertains to pages 19-21 and rows 14, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 2, 3 of the document.

To be eligible for the additional disability coverage described in the Unum Rider, you must be currently insured under their Long Term Disability (LTD) plan. The policy definitions and provisions specified within this Rider also apply to the additional coverage. Essentially, if your disability meets the criteria outlined in both the LTD plan and this Rider, you may qualify for the added benefits. This additional coverage provides a monthly payment of 60% of your pre-disability earnings (up to the maximum benefit amount specified in the LTD policy), which is subject to taxation based on your individual circumstances. Please note that all terms used within the LTD plan and this Rider hold equal significance for the additional disability coverage.

According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, Disability Plus coverage becomes effective on the later of either the effective date of this rider or your effective date under the LTD plan. Once effective, the coverage continues as long as the rider remains in effect and you are insured under the LTD plan.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on page 21 (rows 1-12), you become eligible for Disability Plus benefits when both conditions are met: firstly, proof of disability under this rider and current monthly payments under the Long Term Disability (LTD) plan; secondly, the elimination period shown in the LTD plan must expire. You are considered disabled under this rider when Unum determines that due to sickness or injury, you can no longer safely and completely perform at least two daily activities without assistance or verbal cues, or if there's a deterioration or loss of intellectual capacity requiring such assistance or cues for your protection or others'.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, under the Disability Plus benefit, a disabled individual receives 20% of their monthly earnings, but this amount is capped at the lesser of the Long-Term Disability (LTD) plan maximum or $5,000 per month. The benefit is not influenced by policy provisions that could increase or decrease the benefit amount, such as Deductible Sources of Income.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4703668.pdf (page numbers 21, 22), certain exclusions and limitations apply to the Disability Plus Rider. Specifically, this benefit will not be provided for losses resulting from conditions that necessitate assistance or verbal cues for daily activities on the effective date of coverage under this rider. These conditions include a loss of the ability to perform daily living activities without another person's help or cueing, as well as deterioration or loss in intellectual capacity requiring similar assistance. This policy provision was updated on June 27, 2012 (LTD-OTR-4).

Under Unum Cert 4703668.PDF, for Disability Plus Long-Term Disability (LTD) claims, the policy requires specific information. This may include an examination by a physician or medical practitioner chosen by us, as well as an interview with you. These evaluations will be conducted at our expense.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, Disability Plus benefit payments will cease on the earliest of these dates: when you no longer meet the definition of disability under the Rider; upon your ineligibility for monthly payments within the LTD plan; upon reaching the maximum payment period as specified in the LTD plan; or at your death. Importantly, there are no survivor benefits for the Disability Plus coverage.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on pages 22, rows 1 and 2, the Disability Plus coverage premium is waived during periods when you receive monthly payments under the LTD (Long-Term Disability) plan. This means you're exempt from making payments for this additional coverage while you receive income from the primary LTD benefit. However, it's essential to note that other conditions or exclusions may apply, and you should refer to your policy details for a comprehensive understanding.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, under SATE REQ-1 (6/27/2012), in the event of a disability claim due to mental or nervous conditions, if an individual has been treated for more than 24 months by a psychiatrist and psychologist, Unum will require that they be evaluated by another psychiatrist or psychologist chosen by Unum. This evaluation is to be completed within 30 days from the request. If the claimant does not consent to this evaluation, payment of disability benefits may cease. The chosen evaluator will review the case files, perform a physical examination, and submit a written report. Any dispute about the evaluation results can be resolved through Unum's internal appeal process or by independent binding medical review.
