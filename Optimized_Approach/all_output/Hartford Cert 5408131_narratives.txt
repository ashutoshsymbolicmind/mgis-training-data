Original employees are eligible on the Policy Effective Date, while new employees become eligible upon their hire date. The waiting period varies depending on employee classification (Classes 1, 2, or 3). Reinstated coverage will match the amounts in force at the time of termination and won't require a new Waiting Period for Coverage, Evidence of Insurability, or Pre-existing Conditions Limitations. The coverage will, however, be subject to all the policy terms and provisions.

According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, the maximum monthly disability benefit is determined by the least of four options: a fixed amount for Classes 1, 2, and 3 or a percentage of pre-disability earnings, considering premium paid. If earning less than 20% of pre-disability earnings, benefits are calculated as a percentage of earnings, capped at the maximum benefit. Earnings over 20% do not affect the benefit, but if combined with other income benefits and current monthly earnings exceed 100% of pre-disability earnings, the benefit is reduced. A 50% offset formula is used to calculate the final monthly benefit. If the sum of benefits, earnings, and other income benefits exceeds 100% of pre-disability earnings, the excess is deducted from the benefit, but it will not fall below a minimum amount. An overpayment may be recovered in accordance with the Overpayment Recovery provision. The duration for Infectious and Contagious Disease Benefit payment isn't specified in this document.
