The Unum insurance policy, as outlined in Document Cert 4703669, has specific exclusions. It does not cover disabilities caused by pre-existing conditions, self-inflicted injuries, participation in a riot, loss of professional or occupational licenses, commission of crimes, war, or disabilities during incarceration. A pre-existing condition is defined as any medical treatment, consultation, care, or symptoms for which an ordinarily prudent person would have consulted a health care provider within three months before the policy's effective date, if the disability occurs in the first 12 months after coverage begins.

If an employee returns to work full-time and experiences another disability, Unum will treat it as part of the prior disability. The plan provides coverage for disabilities when an employee is not working due to sickness or injury, subject to premium payment. If an employer changes insurance carriers to Unum, payments may be sent if the disability results from a pre-existing condition under certain conditions: the employee must have been in active employment and insured under the plan on its effective date and also insured by the prior policy at the time of change. The employee must satisfy the pre-existing condition provision under either the Unum plan or the prior carrier's plan to receive a payment.

The policy also defines terms such as Monthly Benefit, Monthly Earnings, Monthly Payment, Part-Time Basis, Payable Claim, and Physician. The Monthly Benefit is the total benefit amount for which an employee is insured under this plan, subject to a maximum benefit. Monthly Earnings refer to the gross monthly income from the Employer as defined in the plan. Monthly Payment is the employee's payment after deducting any sources of income. Part-Time Basis refers to the ability to work and earn between 20% and 80% of indexed monthly earnings. A Payable Claim is a claim for which Unum is liable under the terms of the policy, and a Physician is a medical doctor who provides healthcare services.

According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf (pages [19]), upon proof of death, a lump sum benefit equal to 3 months of your gross disability payment will be paid to an eligible survivor if your disability lasted for at least 180 days and you were receiving or entitled to payments under the plan at the time of your death. If no eligible survivors exist, payment will be made to your estate, unless none exists; in such a case, no payment will be made but any overpayment on your claim will first be applied to the survivor benefit.

In cases where you are not actively employed when your employer switches insurance carriers to Unum, coverage is provided if you were not in active employment due to sickness or injury and covered by the prior policy. Coverage is subject to premium payment and limited to the amount that would have been paid by the prior carrier, with any liability of the prior carrier reducing your payment.

Similarly, for a disability resulting from a pre-existing condition upon switching to Unum, coverage may be provided if you were in active employment and insured under the plan on its effective date and insured by the prior policy at the time of change. To receive payments, you must satisfy the pre-existing condition provision either under the Unum plan or the prior carrier's plan had that policy remained in force. Failure to meet these requirements will result in no payments from Unum.
