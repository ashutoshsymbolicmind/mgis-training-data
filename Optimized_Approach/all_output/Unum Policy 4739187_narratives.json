After this period, payments adjust based on the percentage of income of time following the premium due date during which premium payment may be made.\n\nThe document also details recurrent disability benefits, allowing for continuation of prior claims if they occur within 6 months from the end of the previous claim and specific insurance coverage conditions are met. Any subsequent disability claims occurring after 6 months will be treated as new claims subject to all policy provisions, including a new elimination period.\n\nProof of your claim is required for approval, and Unum may request appropriate financial records to substantiate your income. If your disability earnings are less than 20% of your indexed monthly earnings, you'll receive the full payment. For disability earnings between 20% through 80%, the payment will be adjusted based on the calculation provided in the policy.\n\nLastly, gross disability payment refers to the benefit amount before any deductible sources of income or disability earnings are considered under the Policy.

If you are disabled and your monthly disability earnings are from 20% through 80% of your indexed monthly earnings, due to the same sickness or injury, Unum will figure your payment as follows: During the first 12 months of payments, while working, your monthly payment will not be reduced as long as disability earnings plus the gross disability payment does not exceed 100% of indexed monthly earnings. 1.  Add your monthly disability earnings to your gross disability payment. 2.  Compare the answer in Item 1 to your indexed monthly earnings.
