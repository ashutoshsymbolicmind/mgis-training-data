This policy, as detailed in Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf across pages 3, 4, 10, 16, 17, and 42, outlines key provisions regarding pre-existing conditions. Specifically, it specifies that any medical condition for which treatment was received or could have been sought within the six months prior to the policy effective date is considered a pre-existing condition. This exclusion applies not only to this policy but also any prior carrier's coverage. Consequently, no benefits will be paid if the medical condition falls under the Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion during the first 12 months of this policy. After the 12-month period, however, benefits may be available for treatment related to that pre-existing condition, provided it is stabilized and meets certain other requirements as stated in the policy.

According to Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf, Total Disability Benefits are granted under specific conditions. The insured individual must be completely unable to perform their own occupation (during the Own Occupation Period) or any occupation providing more than 80% of their pre-disability income (after the Own Occupation Period). This disability should be medically verified by a physician and continued proof is required upon request.

The Total Disability Benefit ceases when the insured individual recovers, dies, or chooses not to engage in Partial Disability Employment. The Maximum Benefit Period and the duration of Own Occupation Period are specified in the policy.

Incontinence of bladder and bowel function, requiring personal hygiene care such as a catheter or colostomy bag, and loss of ability to eat by any means are considered total disabilities. If an exam is required, non-cooperation may lead to suspension or denial of benefits.

The policy also acknowledges the need for additional proof regarding other income sources, with failure to provide this information leading to potential benefit denial or suspension within 45 days of request.

According to Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf, benefits under this policy will initially be payable to the Insured Employee while alive. Upon death, survivor benefits are distributed as specified in a separate section, whereas other benefits go to the Insured Employee's estate. The document outlines claim procedures and decision notices: if benefits become payable to the estate or an incompetent person (minor), up to $2,000 may be paid to any entitled relative. The Company sends a written notice of its claim decision within 15 days after resolving the claim or within 45 days after receiving the first proof of claim. Extensions are allowed if necessary due to uncontrollable factors.

A delay notice is sent if more time is needed, explaining what additional information is required and when a decision can be expected. If no written decision is received by the 105th day after the first proof of claim, an immediate review is permitted. The policyholder may request a review within 180 days of receiving a denial notice by submitting written comments or items to support the claim and certain non-privileged information will be available for review.

The Company reviews the claim and sends a written notice of its decision within the specified timeframe, detailing reasons for the decision under the terms of this policy and any internal guidelines. If the denial is upheld, the notice also describes further appeal procedures, access to relevant claim information, and the right to request a state insurance department review or legal action. This notice is sent within 45 days after receiving the request for review or within 90 days if a special case requires more time.

In accordance with Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf, premium waiver applies during any period benefits are payable if an Insured Employee is Disabled. Premiums are waived from the first premium due date post the Elimination Period and continue until the end of benefit duration. Following a premium-waived period, coverage resumption requires reinstated premium payments as they become due.
