This information is derived from the Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf document found on pages 2, 3, 5, 10, 14, 15, 26, 27, 28, 32, and 36. The policy provides coverage for a period of up to 44 months, with benefits becoming payable after the 24th month, subject to all other terms, for disabilities sustained beyond this period, unless the certificate has been amended to exclude that condition. A pre-existing condition is defined as any sickness or injury for which treatment was received within six months prior to the effective date. Treatment encompasses consultation, care or services provided by a physician, and includes diagnostic measures and the prescription, refill of prescription, or taking of any prescribed drugs or medicines.

The policy does not cover any period of total or partial disability due to war, intentionally self-inflicted injuries, active participation in a riot, attempting or committing a felony, or residing outside the United States or Canada for more than 12 consecutive benefit months for purposes other than employment with the employer. During the first 24 months of coverage under the policy, the policy will not cover any total or partial disability caused or contributed to by, or resulting from, a pre-existing condition that occurs in the first 12 months after the effective date. However, if such disability continues beyond the first 24 months of coverage, benefits will be payable for the subsequent months.

For physicians, the definition of total disability is amended to mean that during the elimination period and maximum benefit period, they are unable to perform all of the main duties of their specialty in the practice of medicine on a full-time basis because of a disability which started while they were insured. The effective date of this amendment is April 1, 2011, but only with respect to disabilities commencing on or after that date. Nothing in this amendment changes any other terms and conditions of the certificate, except as stated above.

According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, a Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit may be available for an Insured Employee with a Disability receiving policy benefits, provided they lack the skills or experience for any other gainful occupation (beyond the Own Occupation Period) and have the ability to complete a Program developed collaboratively with their Physician, employer, and self. The program should detail its goals, each party's responsibilities, and the rehabilitation services' times, dates, and costs.

Eligibility is contingent on the Insured Employee having a Disability that prevents performance of their regular occupation, possessing the physical and mental abilities required for the Program, being reasonably expected to return to work post-rehabilitation, demonstrating sufficient motivation, and meeting labor force demand in the proposed occupation. The Company must also find that the program's cost is less than its claim liability.

The Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit amount will not exceed the Company's expected claims liability and will not be payable for services already covered under health care plans or other vocational rehabilitation programs. Payments may be made to service providers at the Company's discretion.

Proposals for vocational rehabilitation can originate from the Company, the Insured Employee, or their Physician when a Program is approved by the Company.
