If you are disabled and your monthly disability earnings are from 20% through 80% of your indexed monthly earnings, due to the same sickness or injury, Unum will figure your payment as follows: During the first 12 months of payments, while working, your monthly payment will not be reduced as long as disability earnings plus the gross disability payment does not exceed 100% of indexed monthly earnings. 1.  Add your monthly disability earnings to your gross disability payment. 2.  Compare the answer in Item 1 to your indexed monthly earnings. If the answer from Item 1 is less than or equal to 100% of your indexed monthly earnings, Unum will not further reduce your monthly payment. If the answer from Item 1 is more than 100% of your indexed monthly earnings, Unum will subtract the amount over 100% from your monthly payment. After 12 months of payments, while working, you will receive payments based on the percentage of income you are losing due to your disability. 1.  Subtract your disability earnings from your indexed monthly earnings. 2.  Divide the answer in Item 1 by your indexed monthly earnings.  This is your percentage of lost earnings. 3.  Multiply your monthly payment by the answer in Item 2. This is the amount Unum will pay you each month. Unum may require you to send proof of your monthly disability earnings at least quarterly.  We will adjust your payment based on your quarterly disability earnings. As part of your proof of disability earnings, we can require that you send us appropriate financial records which we believe are necessary to substantiate your income.

RETIREMENT PLAN  means a defined contribution plan or defined benefit plan.  These are plans which provide retirement benefits to employees and are not funded entirely by employee contributions. Retirement Plan includes but is not limited to any plan which is part of any federal, state, county, municipal or association retirement system. - For Short Term Disability: SALARY CONTINUATION OR ACCUMULATED SICK LEAVE  means continued payments to you by your Employer of all or part of your weekly earnings, after you become disabled as defined by the Policy.  This continued payment must be part of an established plan maintained by your Employer for the benefit of all employees covered under the Policy.  Salary continuation or accumulated sick leave does not include compensation paid to you by your Employer for work you actually perform after your disability begins.  Such compensation is considered disability earnings, and would be taken into account in calculating your weekly payment. - For Long Term Disability: SALARY CONTINUATION OR ACCUMULATED SICK LEAVE  means continued payments to you by your Employer of all or part of your monthly earnings, after you become disabled as defined by the Policy.  This continued payment must be part of an established plan maintained by your Employer for the benefit of all employees covered under the Policy.
