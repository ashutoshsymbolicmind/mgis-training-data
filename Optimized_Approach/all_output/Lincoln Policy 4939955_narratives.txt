This information is derived from Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, spread across pages 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 19, 22, 23, 25, and 30. It outlines the rules for Recurrent Disability benefits, which are treated differently based on whether a new Disability begins or the Recurrent Disability is part of the prior Disability.

If a new Disability starts, the Insured Employee or former Employee must earn less than the specified percentage of Predisability Income to qualify for a Monthly Benefit. The amount will be subject to all terms of the Policy applicable at the time the prior Disability began. However, this Recurrent Disability provision ceases to apply if the Insured Employee or former Employee becomes eligible for coverage under any other group long-term disability plan.

If the Recurrent Disability is part of the prior Disability, the Predisability Income used in determining the prior Disability benefit will apply. The benefits reinstated under this provision are subject to the Policy's terms and conditions at the time the prior Disability began. To qualify for a Monthly Benefit, the Insured Employee or former Employee must still earn less than the specified percentage of Predisability Income.
