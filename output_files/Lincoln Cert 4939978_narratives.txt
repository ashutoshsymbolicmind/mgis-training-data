During a disability, the insured employee may return to full-time work for up to the Elimination Period without affecting this period. Only days of disability due to the same or related sickness or injury are counted towards the Elimination Period, while days on which the employee returns to full-time work do not count.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf on pages 7, the term 'Medically Appropriate Treatment' refers to diagnostic services, consultations, or care that align with the symptoms or diagnosis of the Insured Employee's Disability.

According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, on page 7 row 21, the Monthly Benefit refers to the regular payment made by the company to the Insured Employee in case of Total or Partial Disability. The benefit amount is determined based on the employee's earnings and the percentage of disability, as specified in the policy. The payments continue until the employee recovers completely or reaches the policy's maximum duration. This benefit does not apply if the disability results from a pre-existing condition unless it meets certain conditions outlined in the policy.
<EOS>
According to the Partial Disability definition on Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, page 7 row 26, a policyholder becomes eligible for partial disability benefits if they are unable to perform one essential job duty due to sickness or injury and can still earn less than their pre-disability income performing alternative work. The defined earnings reduction required to qualify is 20%. Payments will continue until the policyholder's earnings reach 80% of their pre-disability income or they return to work full time. These benefits are subject to a waiting period of three months following the disability onset date.

Under this policy, monthly earnings are crucial for determining benefits. The policyholder is entitled to receive a percentage of their basic monthly earnings in the event of a predisability, as long as they meet the continuous service requirement of two years post-benefit effective date. Additionally, the policy stipulates that benefits cease upon death or retirement, but any remaining balance can be paid out as a lump sum to the policyholder's beneficiary. The policy also includes a provision for cost-of-living adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf on pages 8 (rows 5-11), the term 'Regular Care of a Physician' or 'Regular Attendance of a Physician' entails that the Insured Employee must personally visit a Physician, as frequently as medically required under standard medical practice to manage and treat their disabling condition effectively.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, a Retirement Benefit, defined within the context of a Retirement Plan, is a benefit that can be paid either in a lump sum or as periodic payments. It is essential to note that this benefit does not represent contributions made by an Employee; employee contributions are considered received over their expected remaining life, regardless of when they are actually received. The payout of this benefit occurs under two conditions: early or normal retirement, or disability. If disability occurs, the payment may reduce the benefit that would have been paid at normal retirement age, yet it does not completely replace it.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf on pages 8 and subsequent rows 38-45, a Retirement Plan refers to defined benefit or contribution plans that are not solely funded by employee contributions. This term excludes 401(k), profit-sharing, or thrift plans, informal salary continuance plans, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), tax-sheltered annuities (TSAs), stock ownership plans, and non-qualified deferred compensation plans. A Retirement Plan is deemed to include any plan that forms part of a federal, state, county, municipal, or association retirement system or for which an employee becomes eligible due to their employment with the employer.
<EOS>
This section of the Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf outlines the Sick Leave or Any Salary Continuance Plan, a benefit plan maintained by the Employer for Insured Employees. The key aspect is that this plan continues payment of an Insured Employee's Predisability Income for a specified duration after they become Disabled.

This applies only to income continuance, not pay for actual work done.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, on page 8 row 59, Total Covered Payroll refers to the sum of all Employees' Basic Monthly Earnings insured under this policy. This total is a crucial factor in determining benefits paid out. The total payroll represents a significant amount that will be considered within the scope of the insurance coverage. It's essential for employers to accurately calculate and report these earnings to ensure proper benefit allocation, as any discrepancies may affect claims processing.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf on pages 8 and 9, specifically rows 62, 1, and 4, Total Disability or being Totally Disabled is defined within the Total Disability Monthly Benefit section (GL3002-CERT-5 04 01/01/13). The policy considers an individual totally disabled if they cannot perform the material and substantial duties of their own occupation due to illness or injury. Partial disability is not considered under this definition. The monthly benefit amount payable upon total disability is determined by the policy's provisions, with the policyholder receiving 60% of their basic earnings during the first 24 months and 70% thereafter, subject to a maximum and minimum monthly payment as specified in the policy. The benefits will continue until the policyholder's recovery or death. After 24 months, the disability must be medically confirmed to continue receiving the 70% benefit. The definition of total disability may change after age 65 based on the Social Security Administration's definition of disabled.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, the contract comprises the policy and its amendments, the policyholder's application attached, participatory employers' applications or agreements, and individual applications of insured employees. Statements by the policyholder and insured employees are representations rather than warranties, except when they are in a written statement signed by an employee and a copy provided to them. Such statements may not be used to challenge coverage unless these conditions are met.
<EOS>
This insurance policy, as stated in Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, specifies that after two years from its issue date, the validity of the policy is uncontestable except for non-payment of premiums or fraud. For an Insured Employee, coverage becomes uncontestable after it has been active for two years during their lifetime. However, this clause does not inhibit the use of defenses based on the policy's eligibility requirements, exclusions, and limitations, as well as other provisions that are irrelevant to coverage validity.
<EOS>
This insurance policy, Lincoln Cert 4939978, grants the company the right to rescind coverage during the first two years, should an Insured Employee incur a claim and a Material Misrepresentation on their application is discovered. A Material Misrepresentation refers to an untrue or incomplete statement that would have led to coverage denial had the truth been known. The policy allows for insurance cancellation back to its effective date, with premiums refunded except for any benefits paid for the employee's claims. The company reserves the right to recover excess claim payments.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, if any information about an insured employee is misstated, a fair adjustment of the premium will be made based on the correct age. The validity and amount of insurance under the policy will depend on the true facts disclosed. If an employee's age has been incorrectly stated, their benefits will be calculated according to the premium paid at the correct age. Ultimately, the true facts will decide the policy's validity and the amount of any potential benefits.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, the Policyholder is not to be considered as the Company's agent under any circumstances.

For total temporary disability, the weekly benefit amount is 66 2/3% of the average weekly wage, with a minimum and maximum limit. The policy also provides for permanent total disability and specific loss benefits as per applicable laws. It's essential to note that state laws may require the employee to file a claim with the appropriate state agency within specified timeframes.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, page 10, row 1 and 6, this policy strictly prohibits the assignment of rights and benefits under the certificate. Specifically, as per GL3002-CERT-6 04 IN 01/01/13, no transfer or relinquishment of any interest is allowed under this insurance contract.

The notice should be directed to the Company's Group Insurance Service Office.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, when an insured employee submits a disability claim, the company is expected to send required forms within 15 days. If the company fails to do so, the insured employee can provide proof of the disability in writing, detailing the onset date, its cause, and degree. Subsequently, the company will send additional claim forms periodically to the insured employee.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf outlines the Proof of Claim requirements within 90 days after the end of an event (rows [17-44]), though this deadline can be extended if the Insured Employee lacks legal capacity.

Proof of claim must include completed statements from the Insured Employee and their employer, a statement from the attending Physician describing any restrictions on job performance, proof of other income received, proof of benefits available from other sources that might affect Policy benefits, a signed authorization for the Company to obtain more information, and any additional items reasonably required by the Company. Proof of continued Disability, Regular Care from a Physician, and any other income benefits affecting the claim must be given to the Company within 45 days after their request.

Failure to provide proof in time may result in denied or suspended benefits. The cost of providing proof of continued Disability will be at the Company's expense. It is essential to note that this information does not apply while an Insured Employee lacks legal capacity.
<EOS>
This policy from Lincoln Cert 4939978 allows the company to have the insured employee examined by a physician, specialist, or vocational rehabilitation expert of their choice, should a claim or appeal be pending. The exams will occur as frequently as required, and the company bears the expense. The employee may be deemed non-cooperative if they fail to cooperate with an examiner, refuse an exam scheduled by the company, or postpone it more than twice. In such cases, benefits may be suspended or denied until the mandatory examination is completed.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, any claims benefits will be paid following the confirmation of proof of claim and liability. Benefits are payable on a monthly basis for any period the company is liable. If benefits are due for less than a month, they will be prorated on a daily rate equal to 1/30 of the Monthly Benefit. Any remaining balance will be paid immediately upon confirmation of claim and liability again. The payment schedule also specifies that if the period of liability ends before the end of a month, the unpaid portion will be pro-rated accordingly.
<EOS>
According to the specified section of Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf (pages 11, rows 4 & 5), in adherence with Indiana law, benefits shall be paid benefiting the claimant when more advantageous. The policy provides coverage for up to 100% of the Basic Monthly Earnings, subject to a maximum monthly benefit amount. In case of death within the first year, the payable percentage reduces incrementally from 100% to 50%. After the first year, if death occurs, the full Basic Monthly Earnings will be paid out. The policy also includes a lump-sum payment option called the Accelerated Benefit Rider, which allows for early access to some of the benefits under specific circumstances.
<EOS>
According to the document Lincoln Cert 4939978, a clean claim requires written proof of claim that is complete, uncontested, and free from any defects preventing prompt payment.

According to the specified section in Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, a claim may be deemed "defective" under three conditions: if the initial written proof of claim is incomplete, if any part of the claim is contested, or if some other defect hinders prompt payment. The company must provide additional information within 45 days to confirm liability and subsequently settle the claim within the same timeframe following receipt of this supplementary information.
<EOS>
Under the Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, benefits are payable to the Insured Employee while alive. Upon death, any Survivor Benefit will adhere to its respective section. Remaining benefits will be distributed to the deceased employee's estate. If a benefit is owed to either the estate or an incompetent recipient (e.g., minor), up to $2,000 may be disbursed to an entitled relative by the company. Payments made in good faith exempt the company from further obligation regarding that benefit.
<EOS>
According to the Notice of Claim Decision in Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, if any part of a claim is denied, the insured employee will receive written notice within 15 days after the company resolves the claim, or within 45 days after receiving the first proof of claim when possible. The explanation for the denial is based on the policy terms and internal guidelines. The notice also includes details about requesting a review of the decision and whether additional information is required to support the claim.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, if a claim requires more than 15 days for processing due to uncontrollable factors, an extension is granted. The insured employee will receive written delay notices by the 15th day after the first proof of claim submission and every 30 days thereafter until resolution. Each notice provides information on required additional data for liability determination and expected decision timeline. If no written decision is received within 105 days following the initial proof of claim, an immediate review right arises, as if the claim has been denied.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf sections on pages 11 and 12, the company may require additional information from the Insured Employee to process a claim. This information must be supplied within 45 days after the request. Any delay in providing this information will not extend the time limits for claim processing. The lack of timely provided information does not affect these specified timeframes. The relevant rows are [72, 73, 1, 5, 6], referencing GL3002-CERT-6 04 IN 11 01/01/13.
<EOS>
Under Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, within 180 days of receiving a denial notice, the Insured Employee may request a claim review by submitting a written request and supporting documents. The Company will examine the claim and respond with a decision notice that outlines reasons for their decision based on the Policy terms and internal guidelines. If the claim is denied in part or whole, this notice also details available appeal procedures, access to relevant claim information, and the right to seek state insurance department review or legal action. The Company must provide this notice within 45 days of receiving the request, with a maximum extension of 90 days for special cases.
<EOS>
In the event Lincoln Cert 4939978's processing of an appeal requires over 45 days, a written delay notice is sent to the Insured Employee within 30 days following the request for review. This notice discloses the special circumstances necessitating the delay, specifies whether additional information is needed to evaluate the claim, and indicates when a decision can be anticipated. A potential extension of up to an additional 45 days may be granted in such special cases.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, section on page 12 rows 40-41, the insured employee may be required to provide additional information for an appeal processing. This supplementary data must be submitted within 45 days following the company's request. Any delay in providing this information will not affect the specified time limits for appeal processing.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, under ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974), any participant or beneficiary must exhaust administrative remedies before filing a civil legal action. The Policy mandates that such individuals first pursue two administrative reviews following an adverse claim decision, as outlined in this section. Once the required reviews have been completed, the ERISA plan participant or beneficiary can instigate legal action under Section 502(a).
<EOS>
This section in the Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf outlines that the Company will waive any right to contest a claimant's failure to exhaust administrative remedies. In essence, this means that if a claim is made without prior exhaustion of administrative procedures within the policy, the insurer will not argue against it based on this omission. This waiver applies specifically to ERISA regulations and does not necessitate the completion of any additional steps or timeframes for claim submission.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, if overpayments occur on short-term or long-term disability benefits, full reimbursement to the Company is required within 60 days. Failing to do so grants the Company the power to either reduce future benefits under this policy, suspend the Minimum Monthly Benefit payment, reduce benefits under any group insurance policies issued by the Company, or recover overpayments from the insured employee or their estate. Overpayments can stem from errors in claim processing, receipt of Other Income Benefits, fraud, misrepresentation, omission of relevant facts, or any other reason. The reimbursement requirement is applicable regardless of the cause. This policy adheres to GL3002-CERT-6 04 IN 12 01/01/13.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, written proof of claim is mandatory for recovering benefits. Any legal action must be initiated no later than 60 days after the required proof is given. Importantly, such legal action cannot be initiated more than three years after the date written proof of claim is required.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf on pages [13, 14] details the Company's authority over the Policy. The Company can manage, interpret, administer claims, and resolve questions concerning the policy. This authority includes establishing administrative procedures, determining eligibility and claim resolution, deciding required information, and resolving matters upon an internal review request. Any decisions made are conclusive and binding, subject to the Insured Employee's right to request a state insurance department review or legal action. This provision excludes residents of California. The policy was updated on 01/01/13.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, eligible employee classes for insurance are detailed in Schedule [14], rows [4, 5]. The policy grants the company discretion to assess and potentially terminate any or all covered classes if they no longer align with the insurance policy's coverage.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, an employee qualifies for coverage under the policy upon the later of two dates: either the policy's issue date or the completion of the Waiting Period. The policy was issued on [insert date from the document]. To become eligible during the Waiting Period, the employee must wait a specified duration before gaining full coverage. This period typically ends when the employee has met the required time frame, which can vary based on the policy terms. Once either the policy is issued or the Waiting Period ends, the employee is eligible for coverage under this insurance plan.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, prior service credit can reduce the waiting period for benefits in an Eligible Class. This applies when: a) a former Employee is rehired within one year following the end of their employment; b) an Employee returns from an approved Family or Medical Leave, either during the 12-week leave period mandated by federal law or any longer period required under similar state laws; c) an Employee returns from Military Leave in accordance with USERRA federal law.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, effective dates for employee coverage vary. Initial coverage begins at 12:01 a.m. either on the first day of the insurance month following eligibility or resumption of active work, and application/premium arrangements submission or approval of evidence of insurability. Increased or additional coverage starts at 12:01 a.m. on the earliest of these conditions: the first insurance month day post-eligibility, resumed active work date, or approved evidence of insurability. Decreases take effect on the day of change regardless of active work status.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf highlights Evidence of Insurability requirements for coverage expansion or change. Application beyond the initial 31 days of eligibility necessitates proof of insurability (row [61-78]).

Additionally, evidence is required when an Employee cancels insurance, stops payroll deductions, or premium payments from the Flexible Benefits Plan account; when coverage lapses due to non-payment; and for optional, supplemental, or voluntary coverage exceeding Guaranteed Issue Amounts in the Schedule of Benefits (rows [1, 4, 5]). Changes applied after these instances may be subject to insurability requirements.

All these actions may incur an additional cost to the Employee. Modifications made more than 30 days post-eligibility, or due to cancellation, stopping payments, lapse, or excess coverage over Guaranteed Issue Amounts are considered Evidence of Insurability cases (rows [61-78]).

Changes may not be allowed if the Employee's health status has significantly deteriorated since initial enrollment, as determined by the insurance company. These terms apply on or after January 1, 2013.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, if an insured employee changes their eligible class, the new coverage becomes effective on the first day of the following insurance month after the change date, except for cases outlined in the Effective Date provision for increases or decreases. This policy applies to rows [5-10] on page 15.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf detail (rows 13-39, 1-5 on pages 15 and 16) outlines reinstatement rights for terminated coverage due to breaks in service. An employee can reinstate coverage upon resuming active work within the specified timeframes: family/medical leave (12 weeks federal or state law requirements), military leave (federal USERRA law period), other approved leaves (6 months after leave begins), lay offs or termination for any reason (within 12 months). The reinstated coverage does not require a new waiting period or evidence of insurability. To reinstate, the employee must apply or be enrolled within 31 days of returning to active work in an eligible class. The reinstated insurance amount may not exceed the terminated amount, and it counts towards any pre-existing condition exclusion period. A new pre-existing condition exclusion applies to any increased amount of insurance. This rule is effective on the employee's return date to active work.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, an Insured Employee's coverage terminates at midnight on the earliest of:

1. The policy or employer's participation termination date, with claims incurred prior to termination protected.
2. The date the employee's class is no longer eligible for insurance, if they are no longer a member of an Eligible Class, or their request for termination in the current Insurance Month.
3. The last day of the month premium payment is made on the Insured Employee’s behalf or the end of the period for which the last required premium has been paid.
4. The specific insurance benefit's policy termination date.
5. The date the employee's employment with the employer ends, unless coverage continues as provided below, or when they enter active duty in any state or country's armed services (except for duty of 30 days or less for training in Reserves or National Guard; proof of military service will result in a refund of unearned premium).
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf on pages 16 (rows 31 and 33), if an insured employee ceases active work, their insurance coverage terminates. However, continuation rights are available, meaning they can continue the coverage under specific conditions. The most significant condition is the payment of premiums at the group rate plus a 2% administrative fee. This fee will be deducted from each premium payment, and the employee must pay the remainder. Coverage can be continued until the earlier of: the employee reaching age 65 or the end of the policy term. Furthermore, the coverage level may decrease if the employee's former position is filled by a new employee, and the new hire's coverage exceeds the insured employee's.
<EOS>
Under the Disability section of Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, if an employee is absent due to total disability, coverage can be continued during the Elimination Period, provided the employer pays the required premium. Subsequently, benefits are payable without premium payments until they cease. Post the satisfaction of the Elimination Period, premiums will again become due if coverage extends beyond the period for which benefits were payable. If premiums have been waived during a certain period, they must be resumed upon becoming due.
<EOS>
Under Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, during an approved Family or Medical Leave, coverage can be continued until the earliest of: a) the end of the leave period approved by the employer, b) the end of a 12-week leave period required by federal law or any more favorable period mandated by state legislation, c) when the insured employee notifies the employer that they will not return, or d) the start of employment with another employer. Premium payments from the employer must be consistent throughout this coverage duration. Additionally, should an employee's leave coincide with a disability, they are not entitled to more favorable continuation during Disability.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf on pages 16 and relevant rows 64, 65, and 67, if an insured employee goes on Military Leave, coverage can be continued for the same duration as an approved Family or Medical Leave. Essential premium payments must be consistently paid by the employer throughout this period of extended coverage.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, if an Insured Employee experiences a temporary lay-off or approved leave of absence (other than Family or Medical Leave or Military Leave), coverage can be maintained for three Insurance Months starting from the beginning of the lay-off or leave. To continue this coverage, premium payments must consistently be provided by the employer throughout this period. The relevant sections are found on pages 16 and 17, rows 69, 70, 71, 72, 1, 4, and 5.
<EOS>
This insurance policy under Lincoln Cert 4939978 specifies that the employer must not discriminate unfairly among employees in similar situations. The insurance coverage may be discontinued when an insured employee stops active work due to a labor dispute, strike, work slowdown, or lockout. These circumstances render the policy null and void for the affected employee.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, during a Disability, an Insured Employee's coverage termination will not impact benefits payment for that particular period of disability. Benefits will continue as per the policy terms. The disability definition in this context is based on the employee being unable to perform the material and substantial duties of their own occupation due to sickness or injury. The employee is considered disabled only when they are under a doctor's care for 60 days during which the insurance company may require updated medical information for further evaluation. The disability period ends once the employee returns to work, resumes substantial gainful activity, or reaches maximum medical improvement. The policy also stipulates that if an Insured Employee passes away while on disability benefits, those benefits will be paid to the beneficiary designated in the policy.
<EOS>
This document, Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, on pages 18 and specifically rows 3, 6, and 7, outlines the Conversion Privilege provision. Upon policy termination or expiration of the level premium period for a GL3002 policy issued after January 1, 2013, the policyholder may convert the insurance contract to a modified endowment contract (MEC) without evidence of insurability. The conversion must occur before age 75 and the new MEC premiums will be level for the first ten years but increase annually thereafter at a rate not exceeding 4% compounded annually. If the policyholder fails to pay the required premiums, the insurance contract will lapse or terminate. Additionally, the death benefit amount will equal the greater of the net cash surrender value or a guaranteed minimum amount stated in the policy schedule.
<EOS>
This policy from Lincoln Cert 4939978 terminates if an Insured Employee resigns, is terminated, goes on a lay-off or leave of absence, or remains on such status beyond the Individual Termination section's continuation period. Eligible employees can convert their coverage to long-term disability insurance without providing medical evidence of insurability, provided they were enrolled in the Employer's group plan for at least 12 consecutive months prior to policy termination. This 12-month requirement can include coverage under this Policy or any prior long-term disability group plan replaced by it.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, applications for policy conversion must be submitted within 31 days after insurance under the current policy. The converted benefits and amount of insurance could differ from those offered by the existing policy. It is crucial to note that this transformation may result in altered benefits and coverage amounts.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf specifies that the conversion privilege is unavailable to an Insured Employee whose policy terminates due to the Policy's termination by the employer or company, amendments excluding their class, non-eligibility for coverage under the Policy, retirement, death, unpaid premiums, or disability. It also applies if the Insured Employee becomes insured for long-term disability benefits under another group plan before 31 days after their policy terminates, unless otherwise specified. If an Insured Employee converts their Policy coverage and later resumes employment in an eligible class, their conversion coverage will terminate on the day prior to re-enrollment under the Policy. Benefits will never be payable for the same disability period under both the Policy and the conversion coverage. This information is found on pages 18 and 19, rows 25 to 46, 1, 2, 4, and 5 of the document.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, the insurance company will provide a Total Disability Monthly Benefit to an Insured Employee upon completion of the Elimination Period. To qualify, the employee must be Totally Disabled, under the regular care of a Physician, and submit proof of continued Total Disability and Physician's care at their own expense when requested. The benefit ceases on the earliest occasion: the date the Insured Employee recovers or dies; the end of the Maximum Benefit Period; if the employee chooses not to engage in Partial Disability Employment, either during the Own Occupation Period or after, without just cause; failure to take a required medical exam; or 60 days after a request for additional proof is sent, if not provided. The benefit ceases on the 60th day if no response is given.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf on pages 19 (rows 31-39), the Total Disability Monthly Benefit is calculated by multiplying the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings with the Benefit Percentage, limited by the Maximum Monthly Benefit. However, this benefit will never be less than the Minimum Monthly Benefit. Other Income Benefits are subtracted from this calculation. The Benefit Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period are provided in the Schedule of Benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, during the Elimination Period and Own Occupation Period, total disability (TD) is defined as an injury or sickness preventing the insured employee from performing each main duty of their regular occupation. After this period, TD is defined as an inability to perform any gainful occupation reasonable for their training, education, or experience. Loss of a professional, occupational license, certification, or driver's license alone does not constitute total disability. This definition applies from 01/01/13 (GL3002-CERT-10A 98 Residual Disability, Any Occ. Disability Definition 19).
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf details the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit. The company pays this benefit if an insured employee is partially disabled, engaged in partial disability employment, earns at least 20% of pre-disability income upon starting work, is under a physician's regular care, and submits proof of continued partial disability and reduced earnings. The elimination period can be satisfied by days of total or partial disability.

The benefit ceases on the earliest date the employee: stops being partially disabled or dies; reaches the maximum benefit period; earns more than 99% of pre-disability income after 24 months, or 85% after 24 months*; chooses not to work full-time in their regular occupation during the Own Occupation Period, or any gainful occupation after this period; fails a required medical exam without good cause; or does not provide requested additional proof within 60 days.

Fluctuating earnings from partial disability employment may be averaged by the company for claim continuance. If average earnings exceed the allowed percentage, no monthly benefit will be paid for that month. A monthly benefit is not payable for any month where earnings exceed this percentage.

*If earnings fluctuate, the company can average the most recent three months' earnings and continue the claim, provided that the average does not exceed the allowed percentage.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, "Full-Time" refers to the average number of hours an Insured Employee was regularly scheduled to work in the month prior to either:

1. The Elimination Period's start date, or
2. The commencement of an approved leave of absence, if the Elimination Period begins during coverage continuation during a leave.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, Partial Disability refers to an Insured Employee's inability to perform full-time the main duties of their regular occupation during the Elimination and Own Occupation Periods while concurrently engaging in Partial Disability Employment. Post Own Occupation Period, it pertains to the employee being unable to execute one or more key duties of any gainful occupation that their training, education, or experience allows, or being unable to perform such duties full-time and still working part-time. This definition applies during both periods if Partial Disability Employment is present.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf on pages 21, rows 3, 6, and 7, the Progressive Calculation section reveals that a GL3002 policy holder is entitled to 20% of the total gross premium for the policy period starting from January 1, 2013. This progressive calculation is based on the formula outlined in GL3002-CERT-10.4, which dictates the distribution of a portion of the premium paid over the course of the insurance term. This benefit will be disbursed to the policy holder at specific intervals throughout the policy term.
<EOS>
In the specified section of Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, it is stated that the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit serves to compensate for lost income, but not exceeding the Total Disability Monthly Benefit if total disability were present without partial employment. The Partial Disability Monthly Benefit amount will be the lesser of two options: A or B. Option A equals [insert specific percentage or dollar amount here] times the Insured Employee's pre-disability monthly earnings. This benefit is subject to adjustment if and when the Insured Employee returns to work full-time.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf section on Lost Income, found on pages 21, rows 12 and 14, outlines the calculation of benefits. These benefits encompass earnings from Partial Disability Employment. The policy subtracts any other income received by the insured employee from their Predisability Income to determine the final benefit amount. This process ensures that the employee is not overcompensated during partial disability. It's essential to note that this calculation applies when the employee returns to work in a limited capacity while still disabled.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf on pages [21, 22] outlines the Total Disability Monthly Benefit for an insured employee. The benefit amount is calculated by multiplying their Predisability Income by the Benefit Percentage, with a cap at the Maximum Monthly Benefit. This calculation excludes other income benefits apart from earnings from Partial Disability Employment. The Partial Disability Monthly Benefit will never fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit. Relevant figures such as the Benefit Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period are detailed in the Schedule of Benefits. As per GL3002-CERT-11 98 IN Full SS Integ., these calculations are effective from 01/01/13.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf outlines the Other Income Benefits eligible for the Insured Employee, primarily derived from Worker's Compensation Law, occupational disease law, compulsory benefit acts, group plans, governmental retirement systems, Retirement Plans, Social Security Act, Canada Pension Plan, Quebec Pension Plan, or similar plans. These benefits include temporary or permanent compensation, disability income benefits, retirement benefits, and earnings from any employment.

The Insured Employee is required to actively pursue these benefits; failure to do so may lead to the suspension or denial of Policy benefits. Other Income Benefits, except Retirement Benefits, are associated with the same Disability for which a Monthly Benefit is payable under the Policy. A cost-of-living freeze is applied after the first deduction for each Other Income Benefit, preventing further reduction due to cost-of-living increases payable under these benefits.
<EOS>
This policy from Lincoln Cert 4939978 outlines the prorating of lump sum payments for other income benefits. If a specific time period is not provided, the sum will be distributed monthly over the estimated lifespan of the insured employee. The prorating is based on this period, distributing the total sum accordingly. This distribution method applies to all lump sum payments under this policy.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf document (pages 22-23) outlines the estimated payments' rules. The insurance company may estimate and reduce an insured employee's monthly benefits if other income benefits are pending or appealed denials. These reduced payments will be adjusted upon receiving proof of actual awards or completed appeals. If needed, a lump sum refund will be provided to the employee. Additionally, monthly benefits will be paid on a pro-rata basis for any disability period not spanning an entire month (1/30th per day). The policy adheres to GL3002-CERT-12 98 22 01/01/13 guidelines.
<EOS>
Recurrent Disability, as defined in Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf on pages 23 and 24, is a Disability caused by an Injury or Sickness that is either the same or related to a previous Disability for which Monthly Benefits were paid. Upon such recurrence, the new period of Disability triggers a fresh Elimination Period before benefits resume; unless the Insured Employee returns to their regular occupation on a full-time basis for less than six months, in which case it is considered an extension of the prior Disability.

To receive Monthly Benefits, the Insured Employee must earn below the specified percentage of Predisability Income, as detailed in the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit section. All other Policy terms apply to these benefits. If an Insured Employee becomes covered by another group Long Term Disability policy, this Recurrent Disability provision no longer applies. This information is found on pages 23 and 24 of Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf at rows [3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 1, 2, 4, 5].
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, the policy does not cover Total or Partial Disability during:

1. War (declared or undeclared) or any act of war;
2. Self-inflicted injuries;
3. Active participation in a riot;
4. The Insured Employee's commission or attempt to commit felony, assault, or battery;
5. Incarceration for the commission of a felony;
6. Periods when the Insured Employee is not under the Regular Care of a Physician.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, during the first 12 months following an Insured Employee's Effective Date, any Total or Partial Disability caused or worsened by a Pre-Existing Condition—defined as a Sickness or Injury for which treatment was received within three months prior to the Effective Date—will not be covered. Treatment includes consultations, care, services, diagnostic measures, and the prescription, refill of prescription, or taking of any prescribed drugs or medicines. This policy applies from rows [19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, 1, 2, 4, 5] on pages [24, 25]. The Specific Limit is outlined in GL3002-CERT-14 98.
<EOS>
This policy from Lincoln Cert 4939978 details the limitation of Monthly Benefits for Disabled Insured Employees due to Specified Injuries or Sicknesses. These include Mental Illnesses and Substance Abuse as defined within the document. The benefits are payable under the policy terms but are limited to 24 months per Disability period, excluding instances where the employee is hospitalized for an extended duration. Additionally, these benefits will not be extended beyond two years unless the Insured Employee remains in the hospital. Any sicknesses defined within this policy are subject to these provisions.
<EOS>
According to the conditions outlined in Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf on pages 25 rows 14-20, if an Insured Employee is hospitalized at the end of their 24th month for a Specified Injury or Sickness, benefits will be extended until they are discharged from that hospital facility. However, these monthly benefits shall not exceed the Maximum Benefit Period as specified in the Schedule of Insurance. Importantly, no benefits will be paid beyond this maximum period.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf section defines a Hospital as a state-licensed, Joint Commission-recognized establishment that treats inpatients and operates with a registered nurse on duty, an in-house lab, x-ray facility, and location for major surgeries. It also encompasses skilled nursing care facilities approved by Medicare, mental hospitals treating mental sicknesses, and substance abuse treatment centers.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, a mental hospital is defined as a state-licensed, certified, or approved health care facility (or its psychiatric unit) that provides treatment for resident inpatients suffering from mental diseases or disorders. It is essential that this facility has a resident psychiatrist available on duty or call at all times to ensure continuous care. This definition is located on pages 25, rows 44-49 of the document.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf (page 25, rows [52-68]) defines "Mental Sickness" as any emotional, behavioral, or psychological abnormality, disorder, disturbance, dysfunction, or syndrome, regardless of cause. It encompasses conditions such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, bipolar affective disorder (including manic depression), and various anxiety or depressive disorders. These conditions are typically treated by psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, or other qualified mental health care providers through methods like psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or similar treatments.

However, "Mental Sickness" does not include irreversible dementia resulting from stroke, trauma, viral infection, Alzheimer's disease, or conditions that are not usually treated by mental health care providers using the aforementioned methods.
<EOS>
This document, Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, specifies that a 'Treatment Center' is a licensed, certified, or approved state-located health facility with an inpatient substance abuse treatment program. The treatment provided must be based on a written plan supervised by a Physician (as per GL3002-CERT-14.3 98 Voluntary Rehab). This definition applies from January 1, 2013.
<EOS>
Under the Lincoln Cert 4939978 policy, if an insured employee becomes disabled and is receiving benefits, they may be eligible for a Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit. This benefit includes vocational evaluation, counseling, training or job placement, job modification or special equipment, and other services deemed necessary by the company to aid in the employee's return to work. The company decides the employee's eligibility and the amount of any benefits payable. The benefit consists of services aimed at helping the employee regain employment.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, an eligible employee for this benefit must have a disability preventing their regular occupation performance and lack skills/training for other gainful work post-Own Occupation Period. They should possess the necessary physical and mental abilities to complete a program with reasonable expectation of return to work after completion. Their degree of motivation and labor force demand in the proposed occupation are also considered. Additionally, the cost of proposed services must be less than the Company's expected claim liability.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf (pages 26, rows 27-29), the Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit's payable amount is limited by the Company's expectations. This benefit does not cover services already provided under the Insured Employee's health care plan or any other vocational rehabilitation program. Payment can be made to the service provider, at the Company's discretion.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, during a vocational rehabilitation program approved by the Company, the policy's definition of Disability is temporarily waived. After the program ends, the Company determines the amount and duration of any Long Term Disability benefits payable. The Program period supersedes the Disability definition, but normal application resumes post-Program.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, any period of Disability for an Insured Employee will not be covered under the policy if they have received Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit and subsequently fail to complete the program without valid cause. The insurer has discretion in determining what constitutes good cause. If an employee does not meet this requirement, benefits will cease retroactively from the date the employee was deemed ineligible for continued rehabilitation services.

This Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf document outlines the definition of 'Good Cause' for an insured employee under specific circumstances:

1. The inability to participate or complete a Program due to documented physical or mental impairments.
2. Involvement in a medical program that prevents or interferes with participation or completion of a Program.
3. Engaging in other vocational rehabilitation programs in good faith, which conflict with the Company's Program development and are reasonably expected to facilitate the employee's return to work.
<EOS>
The document Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, specifically on pages 26 and 27 under rows 57 to 62 and 1 to 5, defines a "Program" as a vocational rehabilitation plan developed collaboratively with the Insured Employee, their Physician, and relevant employers when necessary. The Program outlines its objectives, assigns responsibilities to each party, details schedules, dates, and costs of rehabilitation services, all aimed at facilitating the employee's recovery process as per GL3002-CERT-14.3.
<EOS>
Under Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, the Reasonable Accommodation Benefit is available for an Insured Employee who is Disabled and receiving Policy benefits. If eligible, the Employer can be reimbursed for up to 50% of costs incurred for reasonable accommodation services, with a maximum benefit of $5,000 per Insured Employee or the Company's expected liability for the Insured Employee's Long Term Disability claim (whichever is less). These services may include providing accessible parking/entrance, modifying worksite, supplying special equipment, offering training materials/translation services during training, and other deemed necessary accommodations to help the Insured Employee return to work with the Employer.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, the employer qualifies for a benefit when they have an employee with a disability who cannot perform their regular occupation at the worksite but can do so with reasonable accommodation. The employee must possess the necessary physical and mental abilities but only with such proposed accommodation, and it is expected that they will return to work with this aid. The Company's provision of the Reasonable Accommodation Benefit is contingent upon its determination that the cost of this benefit is less than the anticipated liability for the employee's Long Term Disability claim.
<EOS>
According to the written proposal outlined in Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf on pages 27 (rows 41-49), reasonable accommodation services are required. The proposal, collaboratively developed with input from the Employer, Insured Employee, and their Physician when necessary, must detail the purpose of the proposed accommodation as well as the associated times, dates, and costs for these services.
<EOS>
Under Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, either the employer, employee, or their physician can propose an accommodation for the insured employee. This proposal must be approved in writing by the company. Once approved, the employer will be reimbursed upon providing proof that they have provided and paid for the services. The company only reimburses after receiving this evidence on specific dates: 1st (row 52) or 4th (row 54) of each month, or bi-weekly on rows 56, 57, 58, 60, and irregularly on row 1. The percentage of reimbursement is not specified in these pages.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, under Prior Insurance Credit Upon Transfer of Insurance Carriers, coverage continuity for an Employee is ensured against policy termination due to carrier switch. The Policy offers credit for employees insured under the previous carrier on their termination date. This credit amount is determined based on the proportion of the policy period served with the prior carrier relative to the full policy period (e.g., if a 3-year policy has been served with the previous carrier for 2 years, the credit would be 2/3). The credit will be applied against the cost of the new insurance premium. This provision helps prevent loss of coverage due to changes in insurance providers.
<EOS>
Under the Lincoln Cert 4939978 policy, coverage is granted to an employee who: a) was insured under the previous carrier's policy during the transfer; and b) was not actively-at-work due to injury or sickness on the policy's effective date. The benefit provided will mirror that of the prior carrier's policy, had it persisted. The employer will pay the difference between the benefit the prior carrier would have paid and any liability of the prior carrier. This applies to rows [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] on page 28.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf details the disability benefits due to a pre-existing condition. An employee is eligible if they were previously insured by the prior carrier's policy at the time of transfer and were actively-at-work and insured under the current policy on its effective date.

Benefits are determined as follows:
1. The policy applies its pre-existing condition exclusion, and if the employee qualifies for benefits, they will be paid according to the benefit schedule.
2. If the employee cannot satisfy the current policy's pre-existing condition exclusion but can meet the prior carrier's exclusion, considering continuous coverage under both policies, they will receive benefits based on the lesser of the two policies' schedules and terms.
3. If the employee fails to meet either policy's pre-existing condition exclusion, no benefits are paid.
<EOS>
This policy provides a Three-Month Survivor Benefit under GL3002-CERT-16 94 28 01/01/13 in Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf. Upon the death of the insured, the beneficiary will receive a lump sum payment equivalent to 50% of the basic benefit amount within three months after proof of death has been provided. The benefit is limited to $28,000, with any remaining percentage payable as a return of premiums. This benefit is subject to certain conditions and exclusions, including but not limited to death due to suicide within two years from the policy effective date.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf section on Family Income Benefit (pages [29, 30]) states that the company provides a lump sum benefit to an Eligible Survivor when proof is received of an Insured Employee's death after 180 days of disability while receiving a Monthly Benefit. The benefit equals three times the Insured Employee's last monthly benefit, with no reductions for Other Income Benefits or earnings from Partial Disability Employment. Eligible Survivors are the Insured Employee's surviving spouse or, if none, surviving children under 25 on the date of death. If multiple children are due payment, they receive equal shares; otherwise, a designated representative will make payments on their behalf. This benefit is valid and effective against all claims by others representing the children. The ages, percentages, and technical terms remain unchanged from the original document.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf on pages 30, rows 5-13, an Insured Employee qualifies for a Recovery Benefit upon returning to Full-Time employment in their Own Occupation with the Employer if they:

* Earned commissions as part of Predisability Income prior to becoming disabled.
* Received Total or Partial Disability Benefits for at least 1 month before returning.
* Upon return, continue to earn commissions while earning less than 100% of their Predisability Income.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, the Recovery Benefit's amount is determined by subtracting all Other Income Benefits from the Insured Employee's Predisability Income, but this calculation is subjected to the Maximum Monthly Benefit limit. It's essential to note that these benefits are restricted to income sources, and their acquisition may depend on specific circumstances and requirements set forth in the policy document.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, an Insured Employee's Recovery Benefit terminates under either of two conditions: firstly, when the employee's earnings upon returning to Full-Time employment equal or surpass 100% of their Predisability Income; or secondly, six months after the employee returns to Full-Time employment in their Own Occupation with the same Employer.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf on pages 31, rows 3 and 4, the policyholder is required to notify the company within 30 days (as of 01/01/13) if they know or should reasonably suspect any fact, event, or circumstance that might result in a claim under the policy. Failure to do so may affect coverage. Furthermore, the policy requires the policyholder to cooperate fully with the company during the investigation and adjustment of any claim. This includes providing all requested information and submitting to examinations under oath. The policy also specifies that any payment made under this policy shall not exceed the actual cash value of the property as of the date of the loss, less any applicable deductibles.
