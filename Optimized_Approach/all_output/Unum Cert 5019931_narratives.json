        "narrative": "According to the Unum Cert 5019931.pdf document, the waiting period for insurance eligibility varies based on employment start date. For employees who were in an eligible group before December 1, 2015, the waiting period is 30 days following continuous active employment; for those starting after this date, it remains the same. Rehiring within 12 months of previous employment resets the eligibility period. Any prior work with your employer will be considered towards the waiting period to determine eligibility dates, which may coincide with or follow the initial month of active employment, and coverage begins thereafter. The waiting period represents the time an individual must be in active employment within an eligible group before becoming insured under the plan."
