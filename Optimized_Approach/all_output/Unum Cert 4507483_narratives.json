        "content": "BENEFITS AT A GLANCE LONG TERM DISABILITY PLAN This long term disability plan provides financial protection for you by paying a portion of your income while you are disabled.  The amount you receive is based on the amount you earned before your disability began.  In some cases, you can receive disability payments even if you work while you are disabled. EMPLOYER'S ORIGINAL PLAN EFFECTIVE DATE: August 1, 2001 POLICY NUMBER: 561007  011 ELIGIBLE GROUP(S): Doctors in active employment in the United States with the Employer MINIMUM HOURS REQUIREMENT: Employees must be working at least 20 hours per week. WAITING PERIOD: For employees in an eligible group on or before August 1, 2001:   None For employees entering an eligible group after August 1, 2001:  First of the month coincident with or next following 90 days of continuous active employment REHIRE: If your employment ends and you are rehired within 12 months, your previous work while in an eligible group will apply toward the waiting period.  All other policy provisions apply. WAIVE THE WAITING PERIOD: If you have been continuously employed by your Employer for a period of time equal to your waiting period, Unum will waive your waiting period when you enter an eligible group. CREDIT PRIOR SERVICE: Unum will apply any prior period of work with your Employer toward the waiting period to determine your eligibility date. WHO PAYS FOR THE COVERAGE: You pay the cost of your coverage. ELIMINATION PERIOD: 90 days Benefits begin the day after the elimination period is completed. MONTHLY BENEFIT: 60% of monthly earnings to a maximum benefit of $10,000 per month. Your payment may be reduced by deductible sources of income and disability earnings. Some disabilities may not be covered or may have limited coverage under this plan.",
        "narrative": "This information originates from Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, spanning pages 5 to 28. The document outlines various crucial details regarding eligibility, coverage, and benefits under the policy. An insured employee must have a regular care provider for managing disabling conditions, be it due to an accident or pre-existing condition. The monthly benefit is subject to the maximum specified in the plan, with indexed monthly earnings increasing or remaining stable based on changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U). The CPI-U published by the U.S. Department of Labor serves as the benchmark for calculating these adjustments.\n\n   The policy covers a recurrent disability if it worsens due to the same cause(s) as a prior long-term disability claim. To qualify as disabled, an individual must be unable to perform their regular duties or any part-time basis job that they are qualified for based on their restrictions and limitations. A full-time employee is considered able to perform their job if they can work 40 hours per week or have the capacity to do so.\n\n   The plan defines a physician as a licensed medical practitioner, psychologist with a doctoral degree, or a legally qualified medical provider according to the governing jurisdiction's regulations. Unum does not recognize family members as physicians for claims processing.\n\n   Notably, a pre-existing condition is one for which an individual received medical treatment, consultation, care, or services during a specified time period or had symptoms that would have prompted an ordinarily prudent person to consult a healthcare provider for the condition(s) within that same period of time.
