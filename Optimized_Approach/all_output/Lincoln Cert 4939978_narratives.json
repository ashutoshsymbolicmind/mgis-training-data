The entire contract between the parties shall consist of: 1. the Policy and any amendments to it; 2. the Policyholder's application (a copy of which is attached to the Policy); 3. any Participating Employers' applications or Participation Agreements; and 4. any individual applications of the Insured Employees. In the absence of fraud, all statements made by the Policyholder and by Insured Employees are representations and not warranties.  No statement made by an Insured Employee will be used to contest the coverage provided by the Policy, unless: 1. it is contained in a written statement signed by that Insured Employee; and 2. a copy of the statement has been furnished to that Insured Employee. INCONTESTABILITY.   Except for the non-payment of premiums or fraud, the Company may not contest the validity of the Policy after it has been in force for two years from its date of issue; and as to any Insured Employee, after his or her coverage has been in force for two years during his or her lifetime.  This clause does not preclude, at any time, the assertion of defenses based upon: 1. the Policy's eligibility requirements, exclusions and limitations; and 2. other Policy provisions unrelated to the validity of coverage. RESCISSION .  The Company has the right to rescind any insurance for which Evidence of Insurability was required, if: 1. an Insured Employee incurs a claim during the first two years of coverage; and 2. the Company discovers that the Insured Employee made a Material Misrepresentation on his or her application. A  \"Material Misrepresentation\"  is an incomplete or untrue statement that caused the Company to issue coverage that it would have disapproved, had it known the truth.   \"To rescind\"  means to cancel insurance back to its effective date.  In that event, the Company will refund all premium paid for the rescinded insurance, less any benefits paid for the Insured Employee's claims.  The Company reserves the right to recover any claims paid in excess of such premiums. MISSTATEMENTS OF FACTS .  If relevant facts about any person were misstated: 1. a fair adjustment of the premium will be made; and 2. the true facts will decide if and in what amount insurance is valid under the Policy. If an Insured Employee's age has been misstated, any benefits shall be in the amount the paid premium would have purchased at the correct age. POLICYHOLDER'S AGENCY .  For all purposes of the Policy, the Policyholder acts on its own behalf or as the Employee's agent.  Under no circumstances will the Policyholder be deemed the Company's agent. CURRENCY .  In administering the Policy: 1. all Predisability Income will be expressed in U.S. dollars; and 2. all premium and benefit amounts must be paid in U.S. dollars.

The Physician, who must be a legally qualified medical doctor or other duly licensed medical practitioner acting within the scope of his or her license, provides medically appropriate treatment for the Insured Employee's disabling condition. Regular Care of a Physician involves the Insured Employee personally visiting this Physician as often as medically required and receiving medically appropriate treatment. The Regular Occupation or Own Occupation is the occupation, trade, or profession in which the Insured Employee was employed with the Employer prior to Disability and was his or her primary source of earned income beforehand. This includes any work within the same occupation for pay or profit, whether with the Employer, another firm, or self-employed. The Regular Occupation encompasses the main duties of that occupation as performed in the national workforce, but by itself does not constitute Total Disability. Partial Disability is applicable if the Insured Employee's current earnings are at least 20% of Predisability Income, with the maximum earnings not to exceed the percentage specified in the Partial Disability Benefit section."

        "content": "CLAIMS PROCEDURES (continued) In accord with Indiana law, benefits will be paid as follows, when more favorable to the claimant. 1. Clean Claim.   The Company must pay a clean claim within 45 days after receiving the first written proof of claim.  A claim is considered \"clean\" when: a. the first proof of claim is complete; b. no part of the claim is contested; and c. no other defect prevents prompt payment. A claim is also considered \"clean\" when the insurer fails to promptly request more information, or to resolve it, within 45 days after receiving the first written proof of claim. 2. Defective Claim.   The Company must request more information concerning a defective claim within 45 days after receiving the first written proof of claim.  It must pay such a claim within 45 days after receiving any additional proof it needs to confirm liability.  A claim is considered \"defective\" if: a. the first written proof of claim is not complete; b. all or part of the claim is contested; or c. some other defect prevents prompt payment. TO WHOM PAYABLE.   All benefits are payable to the Insured Employee, while living.  After his or her death, benefits will be payable as follows. 1. Any Survivor Benefit will be payable in accord with that section. 2. Any other benefits will be payable to the Insured Employee's estate. If a benefit becomes payable to: 1. the Insured Employee's estate; or 2. a minor or any other person who is not legally competent to give a valid receipt; then up to $2,000 may be paid to any relative of the Insured Employee that the Company finds entitled to payment.  If payment is made in good faith to such a relative, the Company will not have to pay that benefit again. NOTICE OF CLAIM DECISION.   The Company will send the Insured Employee a written notice of its claim decision.  If the Company denies any part of the claim, the written notice will explain: 1. the reason for the denial, under the terms of the Policy and any internal guidelines; 2. how the Insured Employee may request a review of the Company's decision; and 3. whether more information is needed to support the claim. This notice will be sent within 15 days after the Company resolves the claim.  It will be sent within 45 days after the Company receives the first proof of claim, if reasonably possible. Delay Notice.   The Company may need more than 15 days to process the claim, due to matters beyond its control.  If so, an extension will be permitted.  In that event, the Company will send the Insured Employee a written delay notice: 1. by the 15 th  day after receiving the first proof of claim; and 2. every 30 days after that, until the claim is resolved. The notice will explain: 1. what additional information is needed to determine liability; and 2. when a decision can be expected. If the Insured Employee does not receive a written decision by the 105 th  day after the Company receives the first proof of claim, there is a right to an immediate review, as if the claim was denied. Exception:   The Company may need more information from the Insured Employee to process a claim.  If so, it must be supplied within 45 days after the Company requests it.  The resulting delay will not count towards the above time limits for claim processing.",

Payments up to $2,000 may be made to a relative if benefits become payable to the estate or an incapacitated individual. The Company provides a written notice of its claim decision within 15 days after resolving the claim, explaining reasons, review options, and necessary information for the claim. Delay notices are provided if more than 15 days are needed, with updates every 30 days until resolution. If no decision is reached by day 105, an immediate review can be requested.
