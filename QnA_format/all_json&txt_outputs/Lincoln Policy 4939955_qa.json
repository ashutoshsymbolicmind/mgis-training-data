A new Elimination Period must be completed before further Monthly Benefits become payable. A new Maximum Benefit Period will apply. 2. Prior Disability.   A Recurrent Disability will be treated as part of the prior Disability, if the Recurrent Disability begins after the Insured Employee returns to his or her Own Occupation with the Employer: a. on a full-time basis working at least the Minimum Number of Hours Per Week as shown in the Schedule of Benefits; but b. for less than six consecutive months following the date the prior Disability benefits ended. The completion of a new Elimination Period is not required before further Monthly Benefits become payable.

The same Maximum Benefit Period, Exclusions, and Limitations will apply to the Recurrent Disability as to the prior Disability.  The Predisability Income used in determining the prior Disability benefit will apply as well.  Benefits reinstated under this provision are subject to this Policy's terms and conditions that were in effect at the time the prior Disability began.

Defective Claim.   The Company must request more information concerning a defective claim within 45 days after receiving the first written proof of claim.  It must pay such a claim within 45 days after receiving any additional proof it needs to confirm liability.  A claim is considered \"defective\" if: a. the first written proof of claim is not complete; b. all or part of the claim is contested; or c. some other defect prevents prompt payment.

Any Survivor Benefit will be payable in accord with that section. 2. Any other benefits will be payable to the Insured Employee's estate. If a benefit becomes payable to: 1. the Insured Employee's estate; or 2. a minor or any other person who is not legally competent to give a valid receipt; then up to $2,000 may be paid to any relative of the Insured Employee that the Company finds entitled to payment.  If payment is made in good faith to such a relative, the Company will not have to pay that benefit again. NOTICE OF CLAIM DECISION.

If the Company denies any part of the claim, the written notice will explain: 1. the reason for the denial, under the terms of this Policy and any internal guidelines; 2. how the Insured Employee may request a review of the Company's decision; and 3. whether more information is needed to support the claim. This notice will be sent within 15 days after the Company resolves the claim.  It will be sent within 45 days after the Company receives the first proof of claim, if reasonably possible. Delay Notice.   The Company may need more than 15 days to process the claim, due to matters beyond its control.  If so, an extension will be permitted.  In that event, the Company will send the Insured Employee a written delay notice: 1. by the 15 th  day after receiving the first proof of claim; and 2. every 30 days after that, until the claim is resolved. The notice will explain: 1. what additional information is needed to determine liability; and 2. when a decision can be expected. If the Insured Employee does not receive a written decision by the 105 th  day after the Company receives the first proof of claim, there is a right to an immediate review, as if the claim was denied.

For coverage to remain in effect, the Employer must pay each subsequent premium on or before its due date at the Company's Group Insurance Service Office.  The premium must be paid in U.S. dollars. PREMIUM RATES.   The initial premium rates for this Policy are shown on the Face Page of this Policy. Premium rates are subject to change. PREMIUM RATE CHANGE.   The Company may change any premium rate on any of the following dates: 1. the date this Policy’s terms are changed; 2. the date the Company's liability is changed due to a change in federal, state, or local law; 3. the date the Company’s liability is changed because the Policyholder (or any covered division, subsidiary or affiliated company): a. relocates, dissolves or merges, or is added to or removed from this Policy; or b. ceases to be covered by the state Workers’ Compensation program or any other program of like intent; or c. ceases to provide or reduces Sick Leave or Salary Continuance Plan benefits; 4. the date any coverage for one or more classes ceases to be provided under this Policy; 5. the date the number of Insured Employees changes by 25% or more from the enrollment on the date this Policy took effect, or the most recent Rate Guarantee Date expired, if later; 6. on any premium due date on or after this Policy’s first anniversary, or any later rate guarantee date agreed upon by the Company. Unless the Company and the Policyholder agree otherwise, the Company will give at least 31 days' advance written notice of any increase in premium rates. MONTHLY PREMIUM AMOUNT.   The amount of monthly premium due on each due date will be the Total Covered Payroll multiplied by the premium rate.  Changes will not be pro-rated daily.  Instead, premium will be adjusted as follows. 1. When an Insured Employee's insurance (or increased amount of insurance) takes effect, premium will be charged from the monthly due date coinciding with or next following that change. 2. When all or part of an Insured Employee's insurance terminates, the applicable premium will cease on the monthly due date coinciding with or next following that termination. 3. When premiums are paid other than monthly, increases or decreases will result in an adjustment from the premium due date coinciding with or next following that change. The above manner of charging premium is for accounting purposes only.  It will not extend insurance coverage beyond a date it would have otherwise terminated. Each premium payment will include any adjustments in past premiums, which are needed due to changes that have not yet been taken into account.  If a premium adjustment involves a return of unearned premium, the amount of the return will be limited to the prior 12-month period. GRACE PERIOD.   A Grace Period of 31 days from the due date will be allowed for the payment of each premium after the first.  This Policy will remain in effect during the Grace Period.  The Policyholder will be liable to the Company for the payment of all premiums due for the period this Policy remains in effect, however. WAIVER OF PREMIUM.   Premium will be administered as follows during any period for which benefits are payable. 1. Premium payments are waived for an Insured Employee who is Disabled: a. from the first premium due date following the satisfaction of the Elimination Period; b. until the end of any period for which benefits are payable. 2. If coverage is to be continued following a period during which premiums were waived, premium payments must be resumed as they become due.",
