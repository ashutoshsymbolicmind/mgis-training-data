It is essential to note that once enrolled, employees can modify their coverage options during the annual open enrollment period or during qualifying life events. Additionally, the policy provides a summary plan description (SPD) which outlines the specific details of the coverage offered and employee responsibilities under this insurance program.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, effective dates for coverage differ based on the type and your enrollment timeline. Non-contributory coverage begins when you become eligible, but if you enroll within 31 days of eligibility, it starts on that date. Contributory coverage without Evidence of Insurability requirement also follows this rule. For any coverage requiring such evidence, it becomes effective upon our approval, which may be later. All dates are subject to the Deferred Effective Date provision.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, your insurance or increase in coverage will only take effect after you return to active work if you are absent due to accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse, or pregnancy on the date your coverage would otherwise start. This deferred effective date applies when your absence occurs before your policy starts.
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, changes to coverage amounts may occur due to alterations in the policyholder's job class or pre-disability earnings. The effective date for an increase in coverage is contingent on the policyholder being an active employee and not absent due to disability at that time. Upon absence, the effective date will be deferred until the policyholder returns to work for a full day. A notification of any change in pre-disability earnings will only take effect from the date it's received. Changes in the policy itself will become effective on the date of the alteration, subject to the Deferred Effective Date provision and Pre-existing Conditions Limitation. Any increase or decrease resulting from a policy change may be deferred if the policyholder is absent due to disability at that time.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, your coverage will terminate on the earliest of seven occasions: (1) when the policy terminates, (2) if it no longer covers your specified class, (3) if a premium payment is due but not paid, (4) at the end of the period for which premium contributions are required, (5) upon cessation of employment or ceasing to be a full-time active employee in an eligible class, or (6) when your employer terminates participation. However, continued coverage may occur under specific continuation provisions unless otherwise stated.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages [11, 12] details continuation provisions of insurance coverage. Coverage can be extended beyond the termination date if your employer provides a uniform plan for all employees. Continued coverage is subject to policy reductions, employer premium payments, and termination upon policy termination, employer ceasing to be a participating employer, or class termination. The benefit level remains the same as pre-continuation day.

In specific situations such as family military leave or medical leave, coverage may be extended for up to 30 days in case of military service outside specified areas (1250 hours eligible) or up to 12 weeks (or 26 weeks with military leave) under the Family and Medical Leave Act. Coverage ceases immediately if the leave ends prematurely. Notification is required at least 14 days before a leave of more than five consecutive workdays, and as soon as reasonable for shorter leaves.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, if you become disabled and cease to be an active employee, your insurance coverage will continue under the following conditions:

1. During the Elimination Period, as long as you remain disabled by the same disability.
2. Beyond the Elimination Period, your coverage will persist for as long as you are entitled to benefits under The Policy.

It's essential to note that the Elimination Period length and the duration of benefits eligibility may vary based on specific policy terms.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, no premium payments are required after the Elimination Period has elapsed, and this waiver continues as long as benefits are being paid out. This means that if you become disabled, you won't need to make premium payments following the specified waiting period. The exact length of the Elimination Period is not detailed in this section; however, it should be noted that the number of premium-free days varies based on the specific policy details.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, if you become disabled and the Participating Employer's coverage terminates, your benefits will continue as long as your disability persists from the same incident. However, these benefits will not extend beyond the date we would have stopped paying benefits had the insurance remained active. The termination of the Participating Employer's coverage for any reason will not affect our liability under this provision. In essence, your benefits will be paid according to the terms of the policy, even if the employer's coverage ends.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (pages 12-13), if your insurance terminates due to reasons other than retirement or ineligibility, you may be eligible for the group long term disability conversion policy under specific conditions:

1. Continuous coverage of at least 12 months.
2. Ability to perform duties of your occupation.
3. The Policy has not terminated.
4. No similar benefits from another group policy.

To enroll, you must submit a written request and pay the required premium within 31 days of insurance termination. Upon meeting these conditions, a certificate of insurance under the conversion policy will be issued effective from the day after your original policy's termination. The coverage available under this policy may vary, with terms determined based on the group long term disability conversion Policy at the time of enrollment.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 13, rows 2-12, this policy provides Disability Benefits if you become disabled while insured and meet specific conditions:

1. You must be disabled throughout the Elimination Period (defined elsewhere in the document).
2. Your disability must continue beyond the Elimination Period.
3. Proof of Loss submission is required to receive benefits.
4. Benefits begin on the first day after the Elimination Period and are paid monthly, but they will not exceed the Maximum Duration of Benefits.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on page 13 (rows 2-1, 2-3, 4-9, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7), if a disability arises from mental illness due to any cause, from related conditions, alcoholism under treatment, or substance abuse (narcotics, sedatives, stimulants, hallucinogens, etc.), the maximum duration of benefits will be limited. Benefits will be payable either for as long as you are confined in a medical care facility or for up to 24 months if not confined, with this total duration applying to all such disabilities throughout your lifetime.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, if you experience a recovery during the elimination period but subsequently become disabled again within 180 days due to the same or related cause, the initial and recurrent disability will be considered as one period, provided the policy remains active. However, if you remain non-disabled for 180 days or more, any subsequent disability is treated as a new disability subject to a fresh elimination period and maximum duration of benefits, along with the policy terms in effect at that time. Days spent in recovery will not count toward the elimination period, but only if the number of days you work during this period is less than half the length of your elimination period.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, when you recover or return to work after a disability, premium payments continue for you, as defined in section [2], row [2] on page 13. This implies that you are no longer considered disabled per the policy terms. The recovery or recovery period does not absolve you from paying premiums for yourself during this time. It is essential to understand that your return to work, while receiving continued premium payments, may affect any ongoing disability benefits under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, if you become disabled and earn 20% or less of your indexed pre-disability earnings after the elimination period, your disability benefit will be calculated as follows: First, multiply your pre-disability earnings by the specified benefit percentage. Second, compare the product with the maximum benefit; the lesser amount is then deducted from any other income benefits, resulting in your monthly disability benefit.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf policy section outlines disability benefit calculations under the Return to Work Incentive (Page numbers [13, 14], rows [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]). If you're disabled after the Elimination Period and earn more than 20% of your Indexed Pre-disability Earnings for up to 12 consecutive months, your monthly benefit is calculated as follows:

  1. Multiply your Pre-disability Earnings by the Benefit Percentage.
  2. Compare the result with the Maximum Benefit; deduct Other Income Benefits from the lesser amount to get your Monthly Benefit. Your Current Monthly Earnings are not considered in this calculation, but if the sum of your Monthly Benefit and Current Monthly Earnings exceeds 100% of your Pre-disability Earnings, your Monthly Benefit will be reduced by the excess amount.

  3. The 12 consecutive month period starts on the last day you start work earning more than 20% of your Indexed Pre-disability Earnings or the end of the Elimination Period. If you're disabled, not receiving benefits under the Return to Work Incentive, and earn more than 20% of your Indexed Pre-disability Earnings, your Monthly Benefit will be calculated as the greater of the Proportionate Loss Formula or the 50% Offset Formula.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, specifically on page 14 row 5, elucidates the Indexed Pre-disability Earnings provision. If you become disabled, and your earnings are less than 20% of your pre-disability income, a monthly benefit will be payable. The benefit amount is indexed to keep pace with inflation, ensuring its value over time. The calculation of this benefit is based on your pre-disability earnings, as stipulated in the policy. It's essential to note that the exact amount can vary depending on your individual circumstances and the specific terms of your policy.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (page 14, rows 1-5, 1-2), it is detailed that if the sum of your monthly benefit, current earnings, and other income benefits surpasses 100% of your pre-disability earnings, a reduction in your monthly benefit will occur, proportionate to the excess amount. However, your monthly benefit will never fall below the minimum monthly benefit. In case an overpayment happens, recovery measures may be taken according to the Overpayment Recovery provision.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, located on page 14 row 2, your Monthly Benefit under this policy will never fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit specified in the Schedule of Insurance. The schedule detailing this benefit is an essential part of your coverage and forms a crucial aspect of this insurance contract.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, if a Monthly Benefit is payable for a period shorter than a month, the benefit calculation will be 1/30 of the Monthly Benefit for each day of disability. Therefore, if you are disabled for 10 days in an incomplete month, your benefit would be (10/30) * Monthly Benefit. This payment method applies only to situations where benefits are due for less than a full month.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, your benefit payments will cease on the earliest of:

1. The date you no longer meet the disability criteria.
2. If you fail to provide Proof of Loss.
3. The date you are no longer under a Physician's regular care.
4. If you refuse an examination requested by the insurance company.
5. Your death.
6. The last day benefits are payable according to the Maximum Duration of Benefits Table.
7. When your Current Monthly Earnings exceed either 80% of your Indexed Pre-disability Earnings if disabled from your Occupation, or 60% if disabled from any Occupation.
8. The date no further benefits are payable under any provision in the policy that limits benefit duration.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf outlines the Family Care Credit Benefit. If you're in a Rehabilitation program and providing care for children under 13 or disabled household members, we'll deduct these costs from your rehab earnings. The monthly deduction per qualifying child/member is $350 (first 12 months) or $175 (thereafter), up to a total of $2,500 annually. Deductions are proportional for periods less than a month. Documentation from the caregiver is required. This deduction ends when you're no longer in Rehabilitation or after 24 months of Family Care Credits during your Disability. No family-related care will be eligible as a deduction. Your current monthly earnings, adjusted for Family Care Credits, determine your monthly benefit. You won't receive a benefit if your current earnings before the deduction exceed 80% of your pre-disability earnings.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (page 15, rows 2-8, 1-1), if you die while receiving Monthly Disability Benefits, your survivors will be eligible for a Survivor Income Benefit. Proof of death and entitlement is required within one year of your passing. The benefit can go to your surviving spouse, children (in equal shares if no spouse), or your estate if there are no surviving relatives. However, any overpayment on your claim will be deducted first. The Survivor Income Benefit equals 3 times your Maximum Monthly Benefit.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 15, rows 2-10, a Surviving Spouse is defined as the legally married spouse at the time of the policyholder's death. Domestic partners or parties in civil unions are also included under certain conditions: either by executing a satisfactory domestic partner affidavit or registering as domestic partners with a government agency where such registration is available, and providing proof unless it's prohibited by law. The policyholder must meet these requirements to be considered a domestic partner or party to a civil union. Continued compliance with the requirements outlined in the affidavit or legally mandated ensures this status.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 15 and 16, rows [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 1, 2], Surviving Children are defined as your unmarried, underage children, stepchildren, or legally adopted children who were primarily dependent on you for support and maintenance. This group also includes children related to you by blood or marriage or domestic partnership who lived with you in a regular parent-child relationship and were eligible to be claimed as dependents on your federal income tax return prior to your death. Children between ages 21 and 25 are included if they are in full-time attendance at an institution of learning. If a minor child is entitled to benefits, the insurance company may make benefit payments to their caregiver until a legal guardian is appointed.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, a Workplace Modification Benefit is offered for accommodating an employee's return to work following a disability covered by the policy. This benefit necessitates the employer's agreement to modify the workplace and our approval of any proposed modifications. We may evaluate the appropriateness of these modifications through examinations or evaluations by selected physicians, health care professionals, vocational experts, or rehabilitation specialists.

Benefits will be paid up to the amount equal to item number 1 of the Maximum Monthly Benefit. The employer's costs for approved modifications will be reimbursed after completion of the proposed modifications, provision of written proof of expenses, and your return as an Active Employee. This benefit is subject to our right to examine or evaluate the employee at our expense.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 16, rows 2 and 3, Workplace Modification refers to alterations made to your work environment or job responsibilities to accommodate you while disabled. This change will not impact any benefits you are entitled to under the policy. The payment of this benefit does not reduce or deny other policy-eligible benefits.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (pages 16-17) details the Infectious and Contagious Disease Benefit. To qualify, you must: carry a disease categorized as infectious and contagious by the Center for Disease Control; test positive after the benefit's effective date; not be Disabled but have your license revoked, restricted, or lose patients due to disclosure; suffer a 20%+ loss of earnings during the Elimination Period. The monthly benefit is calculated: (Pre-disability Earnings - Current Monthly Earnings) x Maximum Benefit under the Policy. Payment ends upon death, Disability eligibility, lack of full-time work effort, failure to seek alternate work, or Maximum Duration of Benefits. Additionally, a Progressive Illness Benefit is available if diagnosed with a Progressive Illness and a Physician provides satisfactory proof after coverage under the Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, a Progressive Illness is defined as a non-infectious, indefinite duration disease or disorder that progressively disables the afflicted person by impacting their ability to perform their own occupation. If you become disabled due to such an illness, your pre-disability earnings will be the greater of either your earnings at the time you provide proof from a physician of your progressive illness or your earnings at the time of disability under this policy. Any disability benefits resulting from a Progressive Illness are calculated using these determined pre-disability earnings and adhering to all other policy terms effective on the date of disability. Until disability occurs, premiums are based on either the greater of your pre-disability earnings under this benefit or your pre-disability earnings according to the policy terms. Your premium will not drop below the amount paid at the time proof of progressive illness is submitted unless you qualify for Waiver of Premium under this policy.
<EOS>
The Ability Plus Benefit in Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf is a monthly payment equal to 10% of your pre-disability earnings (not exceeding $5,000 or the Maximum Monthly Benefit). You qualify if you become cognitively impaired or unable to perform two or more Activities of Daily Living for at least 30 consecutive days due to a disability that begins while covered under this benefit. This payment continues until your monthly benefit terminates, you're no longer cognitively impaired and can perform five or more ADLs, or the covered loss period ends (for periods less than one month, payments are 1/30th of the Ability Plus Benefit per day). The Ability Plus Benefit is not affected by Other Income Benefits or other benefits under the policy. You have complete freedom in using this benefit, and it will not limit your actions.
<EOS>
According to the terms outlined in the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 17 and 18, a cognitively impaired individual is defined as one who experiences severe deterioration or loss of memory, orientation, or the ability to understand or reason significantly enough to impede daily tasks such as medication management, financial management, and telephone usage. This intellectual capacity decline must be measurable via standardized tests. The specified cognitive impairment must hinder an individual's ability to perform common duties.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on page 18 rows [2-24], the Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) are defined as self-bathing (either using a tub or shower devices or giving oneself a sponge bath), dressing oneself, utilizing the toilet, transferring from bed to chair or wheelchair, maintaining bladder and bowel control (voluntary function or keeping up reasonable personal hygiene when unable), and feeding oneself once prepared food is made available. These functions can be performed with or without equipment or adaptive devices. The ability to perform these ADLs may impact the policy coverage.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, the policy does not provide coverage or pay benefits for any disability that: a) is not under regular medical care; b) results from war or acts of war (declared or undeclared); c) arises from committing or attempting to commit a felony; d) is related to an illegal occupation, e) is self-inflicted intentionally; or f) if you were receiving or eligible for benefits under a prior disability plan sponsored by your employer that terminated before this policy's effective date.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, benefits for disabilities resulting from or caused/contributed to by pre-existing conditions are not covered unless one of two criteria is met: either the policyholder has not received medical care for the condition during the past three consecutive months while insured under the policy, or they have been continuously insured under the policy for a period of twelve consecutive months.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (page 18, rows 2-11), a pre-existing condition is defined as any accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, pregnancy, or episode of substance abuse for which medical care was received within the three months prior to either the start date of coverage or a change in coverage. This definition also includes any manifestations, symptoms, findings, or aggravations related to these conditions. It is essential to note that this applies to situations occurring during this specified period.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 18, rows 2-5, medical care services are eligible for coverage under the following conditions: a healthcare provider is consulted or offers advice, or recommends, prescribes, or provides treatment. These services must be medically necessary and essential to the diagnosis or treatment of an injury or sickness covered by the policy. The insured party is responsible for paying any copayments, coinsurance, or deductibles as specified in the policy, with a maximum annual out-of-pocket limit of $2,000. Services must be rendered by a licensed provider within the policy's network unless prior authorization is obtained for out-of-network care. All services must be pre-authorized when required by the policy and received within one year from the accident or onset date.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 18 and 19 under rows 2, 3, 4, 5, and 1, the treatment section encompasses medical examinations, tests, attendance, or observation, as well as the utilization of drugs, medicines, medical services, supplies, or equipment. This includes necessary medications and medical procedures, including diagnostic tests, follow-up care, and any required medical devices or apparatuses. These treatments may be incurred both at the hospital and outpatient settings. The policy does not specify a percentage coverage but provides coverage subject to the policy's terms and conditions.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (page 59, rows 2-6, 1, 2), you or the beneficiary must notify the company in writing within 30 days of either the date of death or the loss. Delayed notice should be given as soon as practical. The written communication should include your name, address, and the Participating Employer Account Number. Failure to meet these timelines may affect your claim.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, within 15 days of receiving a Notice of Claim, the insurance company will provide Proof of Loss forms. If these forms are not sent within that timeframe, the claimant can submit any written evidence that fully describes the nature and extent of their claim instead. This deadline applies to rows [1, 1, 2, 3] on page number 60.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (page 19) outlines the Proof of Loss requirements for disability insurance claims. Essential evidence includes:

   - Date and cause of your disability
   - Pre-disability earnings and current monthly income, demonstrated by tax returns
   - Medical information such as x-rays, photocopied records, and consulted professionals/facilities/pharmacies over the past three years
   - Authorization for release of medical, employment, and financial information
   - Identification of other income benefits
   - Proof that you have applied for available other income benefits

Submitted proof must be acceptable to the insurance company. You will not need to claim any retirement benefits that are only accessible on a reduced basis.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, the policyholder is required to submit to interviews, examinations by physicians, vocational experts, functional experts, or other professionals chosen by the company. These assessments will occur at the company's expense and as deemed necessary by them. The policyholder's proof of loss must be acceptable to the company. Refusal to comply with these requests without a valid reason may result in the denial, suspension, or termination of benefits.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, written Proof of Loss must be submitted within 90 days after the commencement of the liability period. If proof cannot be provided within this timeframe due to unavoidable circumstances or if it is provided as soon as possible but no later than one year from its due date (except when the policyholder is not legally competent), the claim will not be affected. The insurance company may also request Proof of Loss throughout the Disability period, and proof must be delivered within 30 days of such a request.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, if you meet the criteria of being disabled and eligible for benefits, payments will be issued at the end of each month while you are disabled. Optionally, advance benefit payments based on the estimated duration of your disability may also be made. Payments due after a claim termination will be paid upon receiving satisfactory Proof of Loss.
<EOS>
According to the specified section of Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, all payments for a claim will be made directly to the policyholder (You). In the event of the policyholder's death, any outstanding payments may be distributed to the estate. If a payment is due to the policyholder's estate, a minor, or an individual who is not legally competent, The Hartford may pay up to $1,000 to a relative who is entitled to it at their discretion. This payment shall fulfill their obligation for the amount paid.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, if your claim for benefits is wholly or partly denied, you will receive a written notification detailing the specific reasons for the denial and referencing the relevant policy provisions. The notification will also describe any additional information necessary to perfect the claim and explain why it's required, as well as provide an explanation of the review procedure. This process ensures transparency and allows for potential rectification or further investigation.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on page 20, you or your representative can appeal a claim denial for a full and fair review within specific timeframes. For claims involving disability determination, an application must be submitted in writing within 180 days of receiving the denial notice. If no disability determination is required, the deadline is 60 days from the denial date. You may also request relevant documents, records, and information related to your claim and submit written comments or additional evidence. The Hartford will provide a written response with their final decision on the claim.
<EOS>
According to the Arbitration section on Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (page 20, rows [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2]), if you disagree with The Company's decision regarding your Disability Benefits claim after their final review, you can refer the dispute to an arbitrator. To initiate arbitration, contact the main office of the American Arbitration Association in Washington, D.C. Proceedings will adhere to the established procedures for Employee Benefit Plan Claims by the American Arbitration Association. A single, neutral arbitrator selected from their approved panel for employee benefit disputes will conduct the proceedings. Each party will bear half of the arbitration costs unless otherwise directed by the arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding, and judgement can be entered in any court with jurisdiction.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (page 20-21, rows 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4), you must apply for Social Security disability benefits when your disability exceeds the minimum duration requirement. Application should be made within 45 days of our request. If your eligibility is denied by the Social Security Administration, you are required to follow their reconsideration process and, if necessary, request a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge at the Office of Hearing and Appeals.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on page 21, rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4], the company reserves the right to reduce disability benefits under the U.S. Social Security Act based on potential eligibility of claimants and their dependents. If estimated, these reductions will be applied to your monthly benefit. Exceptions occur if you apply for and pursue all required appeals (per Social Security provision), sign a form authorizing SSA information release, return the reimbursement agreement, and agree to repay any overpayments.

In case of actual awards, the company will adjust your monthly benefit upon receiving proof and determine if it was higher or lower than the estimate. If denied, an adjustment is made when you provide proof of final denial from the Office of Hearing and Appeals. If estimated benefits were found to be lower, a refund is issued as a lump sum. Conversely, if overpaid due to underestimation, you must make a lump sum refund equal to all overpayments, according to the Overpayment Recovery provision.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, an overpayment in this policy arises when the total benefits paid exceed what's due to you (Page 21, rows 2-11) or when payments are made under another group policy (row 1). This can happen due to retroactive awards from specified sources, failure to report Other Income Benefits or earnings, misstatements, fraud, errors, or any other payment discrepancy (rows 2-7). Overpayments may result from overstated benefits or incorrect reporting of other income sources.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (pages 21-22, rows 2-20), the insurance company has the right to recover any overpayment determined within 30 days from you or your estate, other organizations, insurance companies, or anyone to whom payment was made. Overpayments can be recovered through court, collection agency referral, reducing future benefits, and legal pursuit. If reimbursement isn't made on time, the company may offset against your future benefits until full reimbursement is achieved, allowing payments to continue once overpaid amounts are recovered. Critical notes: any reimbursement agreement you sign when eligible for benefits under The Policy may further specify terms; failure to make timely reimbursement grants the company legal and equitable rights in court.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 22, rows 2-10, if you sustain a disability due to another party's action or inaction, receive compensation for lost wages from the policy, and fail to initiate legal action against the third party within a reasonable timeframe, the insurer will have the right to subrogate any claims you may have against that third party. They may opt to take legal action themselves to recover payments made in relation to your disability. This provision is effective as per the terms of the policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 22 rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], the insurance company reserves the right to seek reimbursement for any disability benefit payments made or required, should you receive compensation from a third party. This compensation can be obtained through legal judgments, arbitration awards, settlements, or other means. In such cases, you are obligated to repay the company the lesser amount between: a) the payment made or required by the company; or b) the recovered amount from the third party less any associated reasonable legal fees.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, on page 22, row 2, "Third Party" refers to any individual or legal entity whose actions or negligence in whole or in part result in the policyholder experiencing a Disability and triggering benefits payable under The Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 22, rows 2-6, legal action against us can only be initiated after a 60-day period following the provision of Proof of Loss or within 3 years from when it is required according to The Policy's terms. This timeframe prevents premature and untimely legal actions.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, Insurance Fraud involves providing false or incomplete information for benefits claims with intent to deceive the company. This action is considered a crime. The company employs various means to detect, investigate, deter, and prosecute such fraudulent activities. Legal remedies will be pursued if perpetrated by you or your employer.
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, material misstatements about the policyholder may lead to a premium adjustment and reevaluation of coverage duration. For three years following the policy's inception, any statements related to insurability made by the policyholder, that aren't fraudulent, will not be used against the insurance claim. To be valid, such statements must be in writing, signed by the policyholder, and remain effective only if provided within the specified rows on page 22 of the document.

According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, the term 'Bonuses' refers to the monthly average of monetary bonuses you received from three possible sources:

1) Your Employer during the 1-year period prior to your Disability onset if you were Actively at Work before becoming disabled; or
2) Your Employer over the entire duration of employment, should it be less than the aforementioned year; or
3) Any employer or work performed during your Period of Disability. This information can be found in rows 2 to 8 on page 23.
<EOS>
According to the commissions section of Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, the monthly average of monetary commissions can be calculated from the following sources:

According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, Disability is defined as being unable to perform one or more essential duties of your occupation during the elimination period, with subsequent earnings less than 80% of your indexed pre-disability earnings for the following 24 months. After that, any occupation applies. If your current monthly earnings are 80% or more of your pre-disability earnings at the end of the elimination period, the disability will extend for another 12 months or until earnings fall below 80%. Causes include accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse, or pregnancy. Loss of a license to perform duties does not necessarily mean disability, and suspension, revocation, restriction, or surrender of a professional or occupational license do not constitute disability alone. Disability is determined by inability to perform essential duties, not just licensure status.
<EOS>

According to The Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, Vermont law mandates that health insurers offer equivalent coverage to parties in a civil union as provided to married persons.

According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, definitions of terms like "marriage", "spouse", "dependent", and "family" in the policy are extended to include relationships created by a civil union according to Vermont law.

The term "child or covered child" refers to any such child. These definitions supersede previous ones within the policy, contract, certificate, riders, and endorsements.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf details that Vermont law grants civil union partners the same benefits, protections, and responsibilities as married couples under state law. However, federal laws such as ERISA may not extend these benefits to parties in a civil union regarding private employer health benefit plans. Governmental employers (excluding federal) are required to provide health benefits to the dependents of a civil union partner if they offer similar benefits to spouses. Federal laws also control group health insurance continuation rights under COBRA and Internal Revenue Code treatment of health insurance premiums, potentially limiting access to certain benefits for civil union families. Washington residents should note that the Surviving Spouse definition in the Survivor Income Benefit has been amended to include parties in a civil union. It is recommended to seek expert advice to determine rights under this contract.

<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on page 41 row 1, the Basic Amount of Life Insurance provided is detailed. The coverage amounts are based on your annual salary at the time of purchase and the chosen multiplier.

<EOS>
According to the Rehabilitation Benefit section on Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (pages 43, rows 1-2), a maximum of 5% of the combined Basic and Supplemental Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D) Principal Sum is available for rehabilitation benefits. The maximum amount that can be received under this benefit is $5,000. This provision provides coverage for expenses related to rehabilitation following an accident resulting in injury, with the goal of restoring or maximizing the insured's physical function and independence. The benefits are payable after the insured has been out of work for a consecutive 30 days due to the covered injury.
<EOS>
In accordance with the Spouse Education Benefit outlined on Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf pages 43 rows 1-3, a policyholder is eligible to grant their spouse a maximum of 5% of the combined Basic and Supplemental Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D) principal sum, up to a maximum amount of $5,000. However, a minimum benefit of $1,250 must be guaranteed. This benefit serves to support the spouse's educational expenses in case of the policyholder's accidental death or dismemberment.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf section outlines the Adaptive Home and Vehicle Benefit, detailing a maximum contribution of 5% towards the combined Basic & Supplemental Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D) Principal Sum, capped at $5,000. To qualify for this benefit, an insured individual must suffer a qualifying loss and be rendered permanently unable to perform daily activities without assistance. The payment is made directly towards modifying the home or vehicle of the insured, up to the maximum cap, to accommodate their needs resulting from the covered injury. This provision applies only to policies purchased on or after January 1, 2021.
<EOS>
Under the terms of Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, any existing life insurance policies you or your dependents have may cause a reduction in the policy's coverage amount. This reduction can occur via conversion rights, portability provisions, or under the prior policy. These reductions apply if such insurance is paid or payable upon death.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf detail outlines age-related coverage reductions. Upon reaching age 65, a 35% reduction in both Life Insurance Benefit and Principal Sum will be applied on the Policy Anniversary Date that follows. At age 70, an additional 60% reduction takes effect. These reductions apply to pre-existing coverage amounts when adjustments occur post-age 65, whether due to new coverage for You or Your Spouse, or increases in existing coverage. The revised coverage amounts will round up to the nearest $500 multiple (if not already so). An appropriate premium adjustment will be made accordingly.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, eligibility for coverage is granted on the earliest of three conditions: firstly, the Participating Employer's Effective Date; secondly, the date you join an Eligible Class; or thirdly, upon completion of the Eligibility Waiting Period for Coverage shown in the Schedule of Insurance, if applicable.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, eligibility for Dependent coverage occurs on the later of two conditions: either the date you become insured for employee coverage or the acquisition of your first Dependent. However, a Dependent cannot be covered if they are already an employee under the policy. No employee can insure more than one Dependent under The Policy.
<EOS>
As per the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, non-contributory coverage is automatically provided by your employer; however, a beneficiary designation form must be completed. For contributory coverage, you need to submit a group insurance enrollment form within 31 days after eligibility or from the previous policy, if eligible but not enrolled earlier. Late enrollment may require Evidence of Insurability.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, Evidence of Insurability is required under the following conditions: if enrollment occurs more than 31 days after initial eligibility, for amounts exceeding the Supplemental Guaranteed Issue Amount regardless of timing, or if previously eligible coverage was declined from the Prior Policy and later opted for coverage under The Policy. If provided Evidence of Insurability is deemed unsatisfactory by the insurer, the Life Insurance amount will match the eligible amount without providing evidence, given enrollment within 31 days of initial eligibility; otherwise, coverage will not be available under The Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 44 and 45, evidence of insurability is required for dependents' initial coverage under specific conditions: enrollment after the first eligibility date, exceeding the guaranteed issue amount for dependent life insurance, or enrolling when previously covered under a prior policy but not doing so. However, no evidence is needed if the dependent child's life insurance amount is $15,000 or less, or if dependents had previous coverage through your spouse's employer group plan and apply within 31 days of losing that coverage, providing proof of prior coverage, including termination date. If evidence provided isn't satisfactory, the dependent's life insurance amount equals their eligible amount without evidence, given enrollment within 31 days of first eligibility; otherwise, dependents won't be covered under the policy if enrolled more than 31 days after first eligibility.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, Evidence of Insurability is a set of requirements for policy coverage that may include a completed application, medical examination, attending physician's statement, and additional information as needed. This evidence will typically be furnished by The Hartford at no cost except in cases of late enrollment. The Hartford will then assess if you or your dependents are eligible for initial coverage or an increase in coverage under the policy, as detailed in the Increase in Amount of Life Insurance provision. Any decisions regarding Evidence of Insurability will be communicated to you in writing.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 45, rows 2-10, your insurance coverage or changes in benefits (either for an increase or a new benefit) will not take effect if you are not actively working due to a physical or mental condition on the scheduled start date. Coverage will only commence when you return to active work.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf pages [45, 46], if you were insured under a prior policy on the day before the Participating Employer's effective date but were not actively working on that date, your coverage under the new policy will begin immediately, without deferment. The amount of insurance will be the lesser of the life insurance and Accidental Death and Dismemberment Principal Sum you had under the prior policy or as shown in the Schedule of Insurance, reduced by any coverage already in force or payable under the prior policy. Coverage ends after 12 consecutive months from the Participating Employer's effective date unless your insurance terminates for other reasons, the prior policy terminates, or you return to active work. If your coverage ends due to active work, you may be eligible for Active Employee coverage under the new policy. The covered amount is subject to reductions in the new policy and will not increase.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, dependent coverage begins on the later of two dates: either the date you become eligible for coverage, if you enroll by that date; or the date you enroll within 31 days after becoming eligible, if later. If evidence of insurability is required, coverage becomes effective upon the later of the eligible date and our approval of your dependents' insurability. In no case will dependent coverage start before your own insurance begins. Evidence of insurability is necessary for certain types of coverage.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, the effective date for dependent coverage or changes in coverage (either under the policy, for increased benefits, or a new benefit) is deferred if, on the coverage start date, the dependent is either confined in a hospital or elsewhere. Coverage does not begin until the dependent is discharged from the hospital or no longer confined elsewhere and has participated in all normal activities of a healthy person of similar age and gender for 15 consecutive days, except for disabled children who qualify as dependents. This Deferred Effective Date provision does not apply to these specific cases.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, section on page 46 row 2, 'Confined Elsewhere' refers to a dependent who is unable, without assistance, to perform daily living functions normally or leave their home or other residence. This applies when the dependent requires continuous care at a hospital, nursing facility, or other institution due to sickness or injury. The policy covers such confinement as long as it exceeds 14 days.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, if dependents were covered on the day before a new policy's effective date under the prior policy, they will not be affected by the Deferred Effective Date provision in this new policy. The amount of insurance for dependents will be the lesser of what they had under the prior policy or what is shown in the Schedule of Insurance, reduced by any coverage already paid or payable under the prior policy. This reduction applies to both timely elected and untimely elected coverages under the prior policy. It's important to note that this reduction doesn't affect the amount of life insurance or accidental death and dismemberment principal sum for dependents under the new policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 46 and 47, you can modify your coverage or that of your dependents at any time after your initial enrollment. This includes increasing, decreasing, or altering your coverage, as well as adding a new dependent to the existing dependent coverage. These changes can be made whenever necessary.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, any reduction in coverage becomes effective immediately upon the change. Increases in coverage, however, become effective on the latest of three scenarios: firstly, the date of the change; secondly, when the Deferred Effective Date provision conditions are fulfilled; or thirdly, once Evidence of Insurability is approved if required. These provisions apply to rows 2-7 on page 47 of the document.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf section outlines requirements for increasing life insurance coverage. If dependents are already enrolled for supplemental life insurance under the policy, they must provide evidence of insurability for any increase. For those not currently enrolled, the same rule applies to initial amounts. If the requested life insurance amount exceeds the Guaranteed Issue Amount, evidence of insurability is mandatory. Unsatisfactory evidence will result in no change to the existing coverage. This applies to both the policyholder and their dependents.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, if your life insurance amount is tied to a multiple of your earnings and increases due to an income rise, you must provide evidence of insurability if the increased coverage exceeds the Guaranteed Issue Amount. Premium increases will correspond with this expanded coverage. Once approved, no further proof of insurability is needed for future earnings-based increases. However, failure to supply evidence or providing unsatisfactory information may limit your coverage increase to the previously eligible amount and prevent any further increases until approval is granted.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, your coverage will terminate on the earliest of six conditions: the policy termination date, your ineligibility for coverage or the policy no longer insuring your class, unpaid premium due dates, employment termination by your employer, you being no longer Actively at Work, or your employer ceasing to be a Participating Employer. However, continuation may occur under certain provisions.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, dependent coverage terminates under the following conditions: it ends on the earliest of five scenarios: 1) the date your coverage ceases, 2) when premiums due are not paid, 3) when you become ineligible for dependent coverage, 4) if we or the employer terminate dependent coverage, or 5) if the dependent no longer meets the definition of a dependent. However, this may be continued under the continuation provisions.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (pages [48, 49]) outlines continuation provisions for insurance coverage and dependents' coverage. Coverage can be extended beyond the termination date if an employer provides a plan for all employees equally, but it cannot be continued under more than one continuation provision. The coverage amount remains the same as on the ending date and is subject to policy reductions, premium payments, and time limits.

   During leaves of absence (except Family and Military Leave or Medical Leave), insurance coverage, including dependents', may continue until the month following the leave's commencement. For military leaves, coverage can be extended for up to 12 weeks, while Family Military Leaves may extend up to 30 days if certain conditions are met.

   If an employee is laid off due to lack of work, insurance coverage continues until the month following the layoff commencement. In case of permanent layoffs or a status change resulting from reduced hours, coverage ceases after three consecutive months. If an employee is temporarily disabled, receiving disability benefits, and earning between 20-80% of their pre-disability earnings, insurance coverage can be continued.

   Coverage may also be extended for up to 12 months if an employee is not actively working due to sickness or injury; however, the combined continuation period does not exceed 12 months in case of leaves according to family and medical leave laws. Family Medical Leaves may extend up to 12 weeks, 26 weeks with Family Military Leave, or longer as required by applicable law.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, if your dependent child(ren) are aged 26 or older, disabled, and primarily depend on you for financial support, their coverage will not terminate due to age. Proof of disability must be submitted within 31 days upon reaching such age, with the disability having occurred before age 26. Coverage continues as long as you remain insured, the child meets these conditions, and premiums are paid on time. No increase in life insurance amount for dependent children is available, and proof of continued eligibility may be required every two years initially, then annually thereafter.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf provision, found on pages 49 rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], outlines the Waiver of Premium for life insurance coverage. If you become disabled and meet the qualifications, your coverage will continue without premium payments. The continued coverage amount is equivalent to that in force on the date you cease being an active employee, subject to any reductions stated within the policy, and will not increase.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, the eligible coverages under this provision are limited to your Basic Life Insurance, Supplemental Life Insurance, and Dependent Life Insurance. However, it is important to note that you cannot apply for both the Portability Benefit and Waiver of Premium for the same coverage amount. These provisions apply without exception.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 49 and 50 (rows 2-10), 'Disabled' means you are unable to perform any work for which you're qualified due to injury or illness based on education, training, or experience. Additionally, a diagnosis of a life expectancy of 12 months or less qualifies as Disabled. This definition applies throughout the duration of this policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, to qualify for the Waiver of Premium provision, one must be under age 60 and covered under the policy while becoming Disabled. Proof of a Disability lasting six consecutive months is required, starting from the last day actively working. This proof must be submitted within one year after cessation of active employment. The Waiver of Premium is only applicable if you were actively at work under the policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, premiums may be waived if disabled, but this won't occur during the initial 6 months of disability. The insurer can request proof of disability and conduct examinations within the first two years, not more than once a year thereafter. Failure to provide required proof or refuse examination results in termination of premium waiver. However, if the application for premium waiver is denied, alternative options like portability benefit continuation or conversion right may be available. If disabled for less than 6 months and returning to work for up to 5 days, the waiting period will not be interrupted; however, any additional work beyond 5 days necessitates a new waiting period. The same condition must cause disability throughout the entire 6-month period if returning to work for fewer than 5 days.
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, if you or your dependent dies within a year after leaving active employment but before qualifying for Waiver of Premium, the insurance policy will pay the in-force life insurance amount for the deceased person under three conditions: firstly, if you are disabled continuously and this disability would have lasted six months or more; secondly, premiums must be consistently paid for coverage. If these conditions are met, the insurance will provide coverage despite not yet qualifying for Waiver of Premium.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, the Waiver of Premium will continue for you while disabled (until Normal Retirement Age if disabled before 60). For dependent life insurance, coverage is maintained until one of five conditions occur: death, loss of eligibility, policy termination or employer ceasing as a Participating Employer, dependents leaving an Eligible Class, or no longer meeting the definition of Dependent. If disabled and unable to return to work in an Eligible Class, coverage ends but you may exercise the Conversion Right within specific time limits. The amount convertible is subject to the terms and conditions of the Conversion Right; portability is not available. Upon Waiver of Premium cessation, if you resume employment in an Eligible Class, you may again be eligible for coverage.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on page 51 (rows 1-5, 1-2, 3-4, 5-7, 1-2, 3-4, 5), if your policy terminates or your employer ceases to be a Participating Employer before you qualify for Waiver of Premium: you may exercise the Conversion Right within the stipulated time limits and could still be approved for Waiver of Premium if you meet the qualifications. However, if your policy terminates or your employer stops participating after you've qualified for Waiver of Premium, your Dependent coverage will end, and your coverage under this provision will remain unchanged.
<EOS>
In accordance with the Hartford Cert 5361113.PDF, if you or your dependents pass away while insured under this policy, a Life Insurance Benefit will be disbursed upon receipt of valid Proof of Loss, as per the stated Proof of Loss provision. The Life Insurance Benefit distribution follows the general policy provisions. The benefit is payable only once, and its amount remains unaffected by any future changes in this policy. The Life Insurance Benefit will be paid out post-death.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on page [67], rows [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], details suicide-related conditions. If You or Your Dependent commit suicide within a year of coverage, no Supplemental Amount of Life Insurance or Dependent Life Insurance will be paid for those elected during the preceding year. Premiums paid are refunded under these circumstances. If death occurs due to suicide within one year of the Policy effective date, all premiums are returned. This period includes group life insurance coverage under the Prior Policy.

Regarding Accidental Death and Dismemberment, suicide or attempted suicide is excluded, whether sane or insane. For Montana residents, the Conversion Right period changes to 3 years if greater than 3 years, and the dollar amount to $10,000 if less. The second paragraph of the Conversion Policy Provisions is deleted, and the dollar amount stated in the Claims to be Paid provision is changed to $500 if not $500. A new provision added to Claims to be Paid stipulates that no benefit will be paid for suicide or attempted suicide.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf section (pages [51, 52], rows [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 1]) details the Accelerated Benefit feature. If a policyholder or dependent is terminally ill and covered for an insurance amount of at least $10,000 before age 60, The Hartford will pay an accelerated benefit (ranging from $3,000 to 80% of the insurance amount, with a maximum of $500,000). This payment reduces the policyholder's death benefit. Requests for this benefit must be made in writing. If a person provides proof of their terminal illness, they will also qualify for the Waiver of Premium definition as disabled. However, legal or governmental acceleration requirements and any assigned rights to the insurance amount may affect eligibility for this benefit.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, page 52, sections [2, 3, 1, 2], the policy reserves the right to demand consistent proof of Terminal Illness, provided by a Physician. Failure to submit satisfactory evidence or refusal to undergo examination by a Physician as required may prevent the payment of Accelerated Benefits.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 52 rows [2-12], if a policyholder or dependent diagnosed as terminally ill recovers, their coverage continues only under specific conditions:

1. If they return to an Eligible Class and premium is paid, the coverage remains in force.
2. If they do not return to an Eligible Class but remain disabled (subject to the Waiver of Premium provision), the coverage persists.
3. If neither condition applies (i.e., they are not in an Eligible Class and no longer disabled), coverage terminates, allowing for possible exercise of the Conversion Right within stipulated time limits.
4. In all cases, the amount of coverage is reduced by the Accelerated Benefit paid.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages [52] rows [2-15], if your life insurance coverage under the policy terminates for any reason, you and your dependents may have the right to convert this coverage to an individual policy without providing evidence of insurability, excluding Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefits or amounts not eligible for coverage.

If termination occurs due to the policy termination, cessation of coverage for an eligible class, or your employer no longer being a participating employer, you must have been insured under the policy for at least 5 years to be eligible for conversion. The maximum amount convertible in such cases is the lesser of $10,000 or the policy's life insurance benefit, minus any new group life coverage within 31 days of termination.

For other reasons of termination, the full amount that ended may be converted. Conversion rights are not available for amounts ineligible for coverage under the policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, on row 2 of page 52, the term "Insurer" encompasses either us or another insurance company agreeing to issue conversion policies according to this Conversion Right. This provision allows policyholders to convert their existing policy into a new one under different terms without evidence of insurability when certain conditions are met, typically upon the policy anniversary date following a qualifying event such as retirement or termination of employment. The new policy will be issued at the full cost of premiums based on the age and health status prevailing at the time of conversion. Notably, the conversion period usually lasts for a specified duration, often 31 days after the qualifying event or policy anniversary date, whichever is longer.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf pages [52, 53], to convert your or your dependents' coverage after life insurance termination, complete a Notice of Conversion Right form and have your employer sign it. This must be submitted within 31 days post-termination or 15 days from the employer's signature, whichever is later, but not more than 91 days after termination. Upon eligibility verification, a conversion policy proposal will be sent for you to complete and pay the specified premium within the given timeframe. The issued individual policy becomes effective on the 32nd day following coverage end, replacing any prior coverage under the policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, the Conversion Policy provides Life Insurance coverage based on current Insurer rates for your age and class at conversion, but does not offer the same terms as the original policy, additional benefits beyond the Life Insurance benefit, or term insurance. However, Conversion is not available for insurance amounts being continued in accordance with Waiver of Premium, Portability, or Continuation Provisions until such coverage ends. The issued Conversion Policy will be based on one of the Insurer's applicable forms at the time of conversion.
<EOS>
Under the Death within the Conversion Period of Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, if coverage terminates and you or your dependent dies within 31 days, we will pay the Amount of Life Insurance you would have been eligible to apply for, provided that we receive Proof of Loss. If a Conversion Policy has already taken effect, no Life Insurance Benefit is payable under the original policy for the amount converted.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 53 rows 2 and 3, Portability is a feature that enables you and your dependents to maintain coverage under a Group Portability policy even when regular coverage would cease due to specific Qualifying Events. Notably, this provision applies solely to Life Insurance. Essentially, Portability ensures continuity of coverage in the event of certain job changes or life events that might otherwise terminate your insurance coverage.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, qualifying events for the policyholder include termination of employment before Normal Retirement Age or ending membership in an Eligible Class. For dependents, these events are the policyholder's termination, death, cessation of eligible class membership, or no longer meeting the definition of Dependent. Note that a Dependent Child who reaches the limiting age under the Policy is not eligible for Portability.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf pages [53, 54], you can elect Portability for your coverage upon a Qualifying Event within 31 days of Life Insurance termination or 15 days after the Employer signs the application (whichever is later), but not more than 91 days post-termination. Dependent coverage continuation requires the policyholder or spouse to elect. The process involves completing and having your employer sign a Portability application, submitting it with required premium within the stipulated timeframe, and approval results in a new Portability policy without Evidence of Insurability. Effective on the day following the end of coverage, this policy's terms differ from those under The Policy. Employer continuation as a Participant Employer is necessary for Portability availability.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on page 54, you can continue 50%, 75%, or 100% of ending Life Insurance coverage for yourself or your dependents, rounded up to the nearest $1,000 multiple if necessary. However, the maximum amount that can be continued is:
   - $250,000 for you
   - $50,000 for your spouse
   - $10,000 for your dependent child(ren).
   If you elect to continue 50% or 75% now, you cannot continue any portion of the remaining amount at a later date. The minimum amount that can be continued is $5,000. Portability is not available if you or your dependents are entering active military service or were not previously eligible and covered under this provision. Additionally, neither you nor your spouse can continue an Amount of Life Insurance which is less than $5,000.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, portability is not applicable for life insurance amounts being continued via the conversion right, waiver of premium provision, or continuation provisions within the policy. If only a portion of terminated coverage is elected under portability, or if the amount exceeds the maximum, the conversion right may be utilized for the remaining amount. However, the waiver of premium provision will not apply if coverage is continued via this portability provision.
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit is payable if You or Your Dependents suffer an injury causing specified losses within 365 days of the accident date. The Principal Sum, as shown in the Schedule of Insurance, will be paid to the injured person in accordance with the Proof of Loss provision and the General Policy provisions. This benefit may not exceed the Principal Sum for all losses resulting from a single accident. The percentage of Your Dependents' Principal Sum is also specified in the Schedule of Insurance. Specifically, if an injury results in the following losses: death, loss of two or more limbs, sight in both eyes, speech, or hearing, payment will be made according to the loss as outlined in the policy. No more than the Principal Sum will be paid to any one person for all losses stemming from a single accident.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 54 and 55, the life benefit payout is determined by the degree of loss or impairment suffered. The principal sum is paid out in full if the policyholder loses both hands, feet, or sight in both eyes; one hand and one foot; speech and hearing in both ears; either hand or foot, and sight in one eye; movement of both upper and lower limbs (Quadriplegia); both lower limbs (Paraplegia); three-quarters of the principal sum for movement of three limbs (Triplegia) or one side of the body (Hemiplegia).

One-half of the principal sum is paid out for loss of either hand or foot; sight in one eye; speech or hearing in both ears; movement of one limb (Uniplegia); thumb and index finger of either hand. Furthermore, the payout for loss of a single limb or body part is one-quarter of the principal sum.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 55, rows 2-9, "Loss" is defined as:

1. The actual severance of hands or feet above the wrist or ankle joints.
2. The entire and irrecoverable loss of sight, speech, or hearing.
3. The actual severance of thumb or index finger above the metacarpophalangeal joints.
4. The complete and irreversible paralysis of certain limbs.

In all cases mentioned, this pertains to a total and permanent disability.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, page [55], the Seat Belt and Air Bag Benefit is payable when You or Your Dependents sustain an injury resulting in a loss under the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit. This benefit is applicable if the injured person was either a passenger wearing a seatbelt or the licensed operator of a properly registered motor vehicle, both verified on the police accident report. The Seat Belt Benefit is the lesser of the amount resulting from multiplying the injured person's Principal Sum by the Seat Belt Benefit Percentage or the Maximum Amount for this Benefit. Similarly, an Air Bag Benefit will be paid if the injured person was positioned in a seat equipped with a factory-installed airbag, properly strapped in at the time of the accident when the airbag inflated. The Air Bag Benefit is also the lesser of the amount resulting from multiplying the injured person's Principal Sum by the Air Bag Benefit Percentage or the Maximum Amount for this Benefit. If it cannot be determined whether the injured person was wearing a seatbelt at the time of the accident, a Minimum Benefit will be payable under the Seat Belt Benefit. All payments are subject to Proof of Loss in accordance with the policy's Proof of Loss provision and the General Provisions of The Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, page 55 row 2, an 'Accident' is defined as an unintentional collision of a Motor Vehicle. Crucially, for the purpose of this Benefit alone, the injured person must have been wearing a Seat Belt during the incident. This provision emphasizes safety precautions while driving.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, an Air Bag is defined as an inflatable supplemental passive restraint system installed by a Motor Vehicle manufacturer that inflates upon collision to protect individuals from injury and death. Crucially, it should be replaced with the correct parts, following the manufacturer's specifications. It is distinct from a Seat Belt. This information can be found on pages 55, rows 2 and 3 of the document.

Your employer will notify you about your continuation option, the monthly premium amount, and payment procedures. Coverage continues until another group policy is in effect or 18 months after termination/layoff, at which point conversion rights apply (within certain time limits). Minnesota law stipulates that if coverage ends due to employer noncompliance regarding notice or premium payment, the employer remains liable for benefit payments. A reduction in working hours resulting in ineligibility for coverage is considered a layoff. Termination does not include dismissal for gross misconduct but includes retirement. The 7th paragraph of the Accelerated Benefit provision and the 2nd to 4th paragraphs of the Conversion Right provision have been amended, as well as the first sentence of the 5th paragraph of the Claims to be Paid provision.

Washington residents see a change in the Suicide provision, as it has been completely removed. For those no longer terminally ill residing in Washington, a modification has been added:

If you recover from being terminally ill and survive for more than 180 days after receiving payment, any additional benefit payments will be reduced by the amount we have already paid out to you, plus an adjustment factor that reflects the increased life expectancy due to your recovery. The adjusted amount will be calculated using our proprietary mortality tables, and this reduction applies only if the total of your policy's accumulated value and the additional benefit payment exceeds the maximum allowed by law in your state.

The final decision will determine costs allocation.

A labor dispute may continue coverage (including Dependent Life) for up to six months past termination, with immediate cessation upon labor dispute resolution. This provision supersedes any previous labor dispute continuation provisions.
