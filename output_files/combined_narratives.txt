This Unum Short Term Disability Plan offers financial protection by providing a portion of your pre-disability income during disability. Your benefits are determined by your earnings prior to disability onset. In specific instances, you can receive payments even while working during disability. The plan, as detailed in Unum Cert 4767299.pdf [5], offers coverage up to 60% of your base monthly earnings for a maximum of 13 weeks, with a 7-day waiting period before benefits commence.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, effective date for policy coverage is July 1, 2009 as detailed in row 11 on page 7. This means the insurance becomes active from that specific date forward. The policy details the benefits and conditions of the long-term disability coverage under this contract, with further provisions specified elsewhere in the document.
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 4767299 policy number 95460 details the coverage, specifying that the policy benefits are payable to the beneficiary after the insured's death. The policy term is for a period of ten years from the issue date or until age 65, whichever comes later. Monthly premium payments are required throughout the policy term at the rate of $108.23, and partial disability benefits amount to 70% of the monthly benefit if disabled due to an injury or sickness. The coverage is for a sum insured of $150,000, with a lump-sum payment made upon death or policy termination. If the policyholder dies within three months from the issue date, a refund of all premiums paid will be given, minus any administrative charges.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, eligible groups for coverage include all full-time employees actively employed in the United States with the employer. This policy applies only to those working stateside for the specified employer. The eligibility criteria extend to all such employees and is contingent on their continued active employment status within the country. The terms of this insurance are subject to the conditions outlined in the document.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, at least 30 hours of weekly work is mandated for eligible employees to qualify for coverage under the policy. This means that to benefit from the insurance, an employee must consistently work a minimum of 30 hours per week.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, employees who were part of an eligible group before July 1, 2009 have no waiting period for physician services. Those entering an eligible group after this date require 90 days of continuous active employment with no waiting period. All other employees not eligible in another group must also fulfill the 90-day requirement. This policy does not apply to employees who joined before July 1, 2009, as they have no such restriction.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 7, rows 39-40, if your employment ends and you are rehired within a year, the waiting period for benefits may be waived as long as your previous employment fell under an eligible group. All other policy provisions apply. In this case, prior work would contribute towards meeting the waiting period requirement.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf (page 7, rows 44-45), any prior employment period you had with your employer will be considered when determining the waiting period for your eligibility date. In other words, any work history preceding your current coverage with this specific employer may contribute to waiving or shortening the standard waiting period that usually applies to new policies. This policy provision is crucial if you have worked with your employer in the past but did not have disability insurance during that time.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on page 7, the cost of coverage is primarily determined by your employment status. Physicians and full-time administrators or presidents are covered by their employer, while you personally pay for your coverage if you're a physician partner or owner. This information is detailed in rows 49, 50, 52, and 53 of the same document.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, the elimination period for Short Term Disability (STD) benefits is either 90 days or the end date of any applicable STD payments from B@G-LTD-2 (as of 7/1/2009). Benefits commence following completion of this period and are initiated on the day after.

Under the Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance Benefit detailed in Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 8 (row 64, 66, 67, 69, 70), a disabled policyholder receives 10% of their gross disability payment, up to a maximum of $1,000 per month while participating in the rehabilitation program and not able to find employment for three months following the end of their disability. These payments continue only if the policyholder remains unable to work after it is determined they are no longer disabled.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299, page 9, row 17, under the Minimum Benefit section, pre-existing conditions are subject to a 3/12 provision. This means that if you have a health issue that was diagnosed or treated within 12 months before your policy start date, benefits related to that condition may be limited for the first 3 months after your policy begins. This limitation applies only to benefits directly related to the pre-existing condition and not to any other covered conditions under the policy. The 3/12 provision does not apply if you have been continuously covered by another group or individual health plan without a significant break in coverage for at least 12 months prior to your Unum policy start date.
<EOS>
According to the Long Term Disability Plan outlined in Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 7 (rows 5-7), financial protection is provided during disability by paying a portion of your pre-disability income. The amount received is contingent on your previous earnings, and under certain circumstances, you may still receive payments even while working part-time or with partial disability. Key considerations include the plan's definition of disability and its impact on payment eligibility, as well as provisions for return to work and potential cessation of benefits after a set period or age.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, the waiting period for disability benefits varies based on employment start date. For employees within an eligible group before July 1, 2009, there is no waiting period for Physician Partners/Owners, Physicians, FT Administrator, or President.

This benefit was instituted on July 1, 2009 (B@G-LTD-3).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, the monthly benefit you receive (encompassing all benefits under this plan) will not surpass 100% of your earnings, except during participation in their Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program.

<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, under the Other Features section (page 9, row 11), a crucial provision is Continuity of Coverage. This feature ensures that if you were covered by this policy and then later become re-employed with an eligible employer group plan, your coverage will continue without interruption, provided that you return to work within 60 days after leaving your prior employment and elect this option within 31 days from the effective date of the new group coverage. The Continuity of Coverage provision allows for a seamless transition between plans, subject to certain conditions. This means that as long as you meet the specified timeframes and conditions, you can maintain uninterrupted insurance coverage during employment changes.
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 9 and 10, under rows 23, 24, and 2, outlines the Work Life Assistance Program. Key aspects include access to professional counseling services for emotional, financial, or legal matters, as well as resources for child and elder care.

<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4767299 policy on page 12, it is crucial to notify Unum of a claim promptly, ideally within the first 30 days after disability onset. Written proof of the claim must be provided no later than 180 days post-elimination period, with exceptions for those without legal capacity. If proof cannot be furnished within 180 days, it should be given within a year. The claim form can be obtained from your employer or requested directly from Unum. If you do not receive the form within 15 days of your request, submit written proof of claim regardless. Notify Unum immediately upon returning to work in any capacity.
<EOS>
To file a claim under Unum Cert 4767299.PDF, both you and your employer are required to complete the respective sections of the claim form. Upon completion, submit the form to your attending physician. The physician should then fill out their section of the form and send it directly to Unum for processing. This process ensures prompt evaluation of your claim.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, proof of claim requires:

1. Evidence of regular medical care from a physician.
2. Documentation of your pre-disability monthly earnings.
3. The date and cause of your disability.
4. Details about the extent of your disability, including any restrictions and limitations affecting your ability to work.

6. In some cases, ongoing proof of regular medical care may be required within 45 days of request.
7. Unum may also ask for authorization to access additional medical and non-medical information.
8. Failure to submit necessary information can lead to claim denial or cessation of payments.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 12 and 13, row numbers 1 to 3, the recipient of payments under LTD-CLM-2 (effective as of 7/1/2009) is you. This long-term disability claim payment is made directly by Unum to you.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on page 13, if an overpayment occurs due to fraud, processing error, or receipt of deductible income sources, you are required to repay the full amount. The method for repayment will be determined by Unum, with recovery capped at the amount paid to you. It is essential to note that Unum will not recover more money than what was initially paid out.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, on page 14, row 3 under Employee-1 (effective July 1, 2009), the policy outlines that the employer contributes 50% towards Short-Term Disability benefits with a weekly benefit amount of $500, subject to a maximum monthly contribution limit of $6,000 per employee. This contribution is to be made for the first 13 weeks of disability. The benefit payable to the employee is 60% of their pre-disability earnings, subject to a maximum weekly benefit amount of $5,000. After the initial 13 weeks, the employee's contributions are required, and the employer's contribution reduces to 25%. This policy specifies that the waiting period for benefits is 7 days. The policy also states that if an employee returns to work on a part-time basis during disability leave, their Short-Term Disability benefit will be reduced proportionately.
<EOS>
Unum's Certificate of Coverage (page 14, rows 1-6) is a statement summarizing the coverage to which you may be entitled, detailing who will receive payments, and outlining any limitations, exclusions, and requirements within your plan. It serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding your policy's provisions and restrictions.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on page 14, you are eligible for coverage if you're employed by your group. The eligibility date is the later of two dates: either the plan's effective date or the day following completion of your waiting period. This means, should the effective date have already passed and you've met the waiting period requirements, you would then be eligible for coverage on the subsequent day.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, your coverage begins based on the cost-sharing structure and application timing. If your employer fully covers the policy, you are insured from the moment you're eligible for coverage. Alternatively, if you share costs with your employer or pay completely yourself, coverage starts at 12:01 a.m., either on the date of eligibility if you apply within that timeframe, or within 31 days afterward, or upon approval of your application (if evidence of insurability is required due to late application or voluntary cancellation). Evidence of insurability can be obtained from your employer when necessary. This document outlines specific requirements for this policy regarding coverage commencement.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 14, rows 1 and 2, if you are absent from work due to injury, sickness, temporary layoff, or leave of absence, your coverage will commence upon your return to active employment. This policy does not provide benefits during periods of inactivity at work.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 14, rows 1-3, if you experience a temporary layoff and pay the premium, your coverage will be maintained until the end of the month following the month your temporary layoff commences.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on page 15, if an employee is on a leave of absence and premiums are paid, coverage will continue through the month immediately following the one in which their leave begins. This policy applies during leaves that start on or after July 1st, 2009.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, any changes to your coverage, whether an increase or addition, become effective immediately if you're in active employment, on a covered layoff, or leave of absence. If you're not working due to illness or injury, the increased or additional coverage commences upon your return to work. Decreases in coverage take effect instantly without impacting any claims that were payable prior to the decrease.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, your policy or plan coverage ends on the earliest of: (1) the date you're no longer in an eligible group, (2) the date your eligible group is no longer covered, (3) the last day of the period for which required contributions were not made, (4) the last day you're in active employment unless specified under the covered layoff or leave of absence provision, or (5) the policy cancellation date. Unum may cancel the policy if participation requirements are not met, there are fewer than 10 employees insured, required information is not provided promptly, or obligations related to the policy are not fulfilled. Coverage provides for a payable claim that occurs while you're covered under the policy or plan. Additionally, nonpayment of premium and failure to meet policy-related obligations can lead to cancellation.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 15, rows 1-3, you can initiate legal action for your claim within 60 days following proof of claim submission, with the option to do so up to 3 years from the time required proof is due. Federal law exceptions may apply in certain cases.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, any statements you or your employer make in a signed application for coverage are considered as representations, not warranties. Incomplete or untrue statements may lead to the reduction, denial of claims, or cancellation of your policy from its original effective date. This action will be based solely on statements in the signed application.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on page 16 rows 3, 1, 3, 4, and 5, if the employer provides inaccurate information about you, the policy will apply the facts to determine your plan coverage and premium amounts, and make a fair adjustment of the premium as necessary.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, it is a crime to knowingly and intentionally provide false, incomplete, or misleading information to Unum for insurance fraud purposes. This includes filing a claim with such information. Such actions will lead to claim denial and may result in prosecution and punishment under state and federal law. Unum promises to focus on detection, investigation, and prosecution of insurance fraud, and will pursue legal remedies when needed. The policy emphasizes that engaging in this behavior will not spare you or your employer from additional insurance costs.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, this policy does not substitute or alter any obligations related to workers' compensation or state disability insurance coverage. In other words, you will still need to comply with the requirements for these coverages as usual.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 16 and 17, your employer acts as an agent either for their own interests or on your behalf under this policy. However, it's important to note that your employer will never be considered an agent of Unum under any circumstances. This rule has been in effect since STD-BEN-1 on July 1, 2009.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, disability is defined as a condition where an individual cannot perform the material and substantial duties of their regular occupation due to sickness or injury, resulting in a 20% or more loss in indexed monthly earnings. This determination requires regular medical care. Loss of a professional license or certification does not automatically qualify for disability benefits. Unum reserves the right to have examinees evaluated by physicians, other medical practitioners, and vocational experts, covering examination costs. Frequent examinations are permissible, as well as interviews with authorized Unum representatives.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, if you qualify for benefits under items 1, 2, and 3 in the deductible sources of income section, your Long Term Disability payment may be estimated and reduced if these benefits have not been awarded, denied, or are being appealed. However, your payment will NOT be reduced if you appeal your denial to all administrative levels and sign Unum's payment option form, promising to repay any overpayment caused by an award.

Your payment reduction is adjusted upon receiving proof of the awarded amount or when all necessary appeals are completed, at which point a lump sum refund will be issued. If you receive a lump sum from any deductible sources, it will be pro-rated monthly over the given time period, with a reasonable one applied if none is stated.
<EOS>
Under Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, if you're disabled and still working, your disability days are counted towards the elimination period. This means that if you have accrued enough days of disability while employed, you may satisfy the elimination period requirements for claim approval. The elimination period is typically 30-180 days depending on your policy. It's essential to understand this rule, as it directly impacts the timeframe for your benefits eligibility should you become disabled during employment.
<EOS>
According to Unum  Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 26 and 27, under rows 1, 2, 3, 2, and 3, payments will be made once your claim is approved, if the elimination period has passed and you are indeed disabled. The payments are issued monthly for any duration that Unum is responsible for. This information pertains to LTD-BEN-2 from July 1, 2009.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, your disability payment will be determined by the following process: Your monthly benefit amount is calculated as a percentage of your pre-disability earnings, up to the maximum monthly benefit specified in the policy, and paid monthly for the duration of your disability, until you reach the Normal Retirement Age (NRA), at which point it may be converted into a retirement benefit. The percentage depends on your occupation: If you're engaged in sedentary work, it's 60%; if light or medium, it's 70%, and for heavy, skilled, or semi-skilled labor, it's 85%. Your pre-disability earnings cannot exceed the policy's maximum earnings limit. If you have any questions, please refer to your specific policy for details.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, section 3, the weekly gross disability payment you receive is either the maximum benefit specified in the policy or your calculated weekly disability amount (whichever is less). This means that if your disability calculation yields a higher figure than the maximum weekly benefit, the latter will be applied to your payments. Please refer to page 18, row 4 for further details on this policy.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, page 27, row 9, the monthly payment figure (Item 4) you receive under disability coverage is subject to deduction of any other sources of income. This means that if you earn an additional income during your disability period, it will be subtracted from your disability payment. This policy helps ensure that you do not exceed your total income limit while receiving disability benefits.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 18 and 19, "Weekly Earnings" for Physician Partners/Owners is the average of your ordinary income from trade or business activities (Schedule K-1) and wages, tips, and other compensation (W-2) over the lesser of three recent tax years or your period as an owner, if less than 3 years. Excluded are car, housing, moving allowances, Employer contributions to a deferred compensation plan, and income from sources other than your Employer. For all other Employees, it's their total income before taxes for the calendar year prior to disability or their employment period if no W-2 was issued. Excluded are similar allowances, deferred compensation plan contributions, and non-Employer income. The total income is before taxes and any pre-tax deductions, including Section 125 plans or flexible spending accounts (STD-BEN-3, 7/1/2009).
<EOS>
During a covered layoff or leave of absence as detailed in Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, if you become disabled, your monthly earnings for disability benefits will be based on your pre-absence employment. Specifically, we will reference the income from your employer effective just prior to when your absence begins. This means that your previous salary before going on leave or being laid off will determine your benefits in the event of a disability during this period.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 28 rows [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11], if you become disabled due to the same sickness or injury, and your monthly disability earnings are less than 20% of your indexed monthly earnings, Unum will send a monthly payment. If your disability earnings fall between 20% and 80%, Unum calculates your payment: for the first 12 months while working, there's no reduction in your monthly payment as long as the combined disability earnings and gross disability payment do not surpass 100% of indexed monthly earnings.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, your lost earnings will be calculated as a percentage of your weekly income for the benefit period. To determine this percentage, simply divide your total lost earnings by your weekly salary. This figure represents the amount you'll receive under the policy. The benefit period is not specified in this document; please refer to other sections or contact Unum for further details. Keep in mind that this policy may change over time and is subject to various conditions and exclusions, as detailed elsewhere in the document.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Cert 4767299.pdf (page 19, rows 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21), your weekly payment will be multiplied by the number in Item 2. You must submit evidence of your disability earnings weekly, and Unum reserves the right to adjust this payment accordingly. Proof of income may require appropriate financial records. These records are necessary for Unum to substantiate your reported earnings.
<EOS>
According to Unum's policy as detailed in Cert 4767299, page 29 rows 1-10, if your disability earnings fluctuate significantly month-to-month, the company may calculate an average of your earnings over the past three months to determine the continuation of your claim. The claim will not be terminated unless the average of your disability earnings for the last three months exceeds 80% of indexed monthly earnings. During any month where your disability earnings surpass 80% of your indexed monthly earnings, Unum will not provide payment to you.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, when disability payments are issued, gross payments will be reduced by any deductible sources of income. These sources may include, but are not limited to, workers' compensation benefits, Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and state disability insurance. The reduction percentage depends on the specific type of benefit received. For example, SSDI or SSI benefits will result in a 50% reduction, while workers' compensation benefits may lead to an 85% reduction. It is essential to notify Unum of any income from these sources to avoid overpayment.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, page 20 rows 2, 4, and 5, your disability income payments are excluded if they come from state compulsory benefit acts or laws, as well as other group insurance plans. This means that the benefits you receive under these sources will not impact the disability payments you may be entitled to under this policy. The policy is designed to provide you with income replacement in case of a disabling illness or injury that prevents you from working and meeting the definition of disabled as specified in the policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, page 20 row 8, under Title 46, United States Code Section 688 (The Jones Act), the benefit amount received is subject to a specific formula. This calculation includes wages earned during the first three nautical miles, multiplied by 50%, and the remaining unlimited miles, multiplied by 25%. Notably, these percentages are applicable for each day of total disability resulting from an injury or sickness. The daily wage is calculated based on the average monthly earnings during the 36-month period immediately preceding the date of injury or disability.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, disability payments under your employer's retirement plan are considered if they don't reduce the benefits that would have been paid without disability. Retirement payments stem from your employer's contributions to the plan. Disability benefits reducing the retirement benefit are also regarded as retirement benefits. Simultaneously throughout your lifetime, Unum considers both your and your employer's contributions. Retirement funds not rolled over or transferred to an eligible retirement plan as per IRC Section 402 are excluded. Unum will subtract only deductible sources of income resulting from the same disability. The eligibility for retirement plans follows the definition in IRC Section 402, inclusive of any future amendments. These payments begin when reaching either age 62 or the normal retirement age defined in your employer's plan.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, sources of income that are not deductible from gross disability payments include various types such as 401(k) plans, profit sharing plans, thrift plans, tax-sheltered annuities, stock ownership plans, non-qualified deferred compensation plans, pension plans for partners, military pensions and disability income, credit disability insurance, franchise disability income plans, retirement plans from another employer, individual retirement accounts (IRA), individual disability income plans, salary continuation or accumulated sick leave plans. These sources also include LTD-BEN-6 from July 1, 2009.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on page 31, the minimum monthly payment under this policy is set at either $100 or 10% of your gross disability payment. In case of an outstanding overpayment, Unum may apply this amount towards it. It's important to note that this minimum payment serves as a base and could potentially be higher depending on other factors within the policy terms.

According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, payments will be made monthly for a maximum period based on the policy holder's age at disability. This period ranges from 12 months for those aged 69 or older, up to 60 months for individuals turning 62 while the policy was in effect. For ages between 63 and 68, the duration decreases from 48 months to 24 months. The year of birth impacts the Social Security Normal Retirement Age (ranging from 65 years for those born before 1937 to 67 years for those born after 1960). The policy details state that payments will cease once this maximum period is reached, or when the policy holder returns to work and no longer meets the disability definition.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, payments will cease when the claim ends on the earliest occasion among the following:

1. If you can work part-time in your regular occupation and choose not to, or if you are working with monthly disability earnings exceeding 80% of your indexed monthly earnings. The cessation occurs on the date your earnings surpass 80%.
2. At the end of the maximum payment period.
3. If you no longer meet the plan's disability criteria, unless eligible for Unum's Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program.
4. If proof of continuing disability is not submitted, or after 12 months of payments if residing outside the United States or Canada (considered as such when you spend a total of 6 months or more in these countries during any consecutive 12-month period of benefits).
5. Upon your death.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, the following disabilities are not covered under the plan: self-inflicted injuries, participation in a riot, loss of a professional or occupational license/certification, commission of a crime for which conviction has occurred, and pre-existing conditions. Additionally, the plan does not cover disabilities due to war, act of war, or any period of disability during incarceration. This information applies from 7/1/2009 (LTD-BEN-9).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, if your current disability is related to the same cause(s) as a previous one for which Unum made payments, and you've worked full-time for your employer for 14 days or less between these periods, your current disability will be considered recurrent and exempt from a new elimination period. However, if you've worked full-time for 15 days or more, your current disability claim will be treated as a new one, subject to the plan's provisions, requiring a new elimination period and maximum payment duration. This policy update was implemented on July 1, 2009 (STD-BEN-7).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, if a disability for which payment has been made persists while you work full time for your employer for less than one day, it will be considered part of the prior claim, adhering to the same plan terms as before. If this condition is not met, the disability will be treated as a new claim, subject to all policy provisions. Simultaneous receipt of payments from any other group short-term disability plan renders you ineligible for Unum payments (STD-OTR-1, 7/1/2009).
<EOS>
This information from Unum Cert 4767299.pdf (pages 36-37) outlines the Vocational Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program. Eligibility for this program is at Unum's discretion, contingent upon medical ability for return-to-work. The claim file will be assessed by a rehabilitation professional to determine if a tailored rehabilitation plan is suitable. Services offered within the plan may include employer coordination, adaptive equipment or job accommodations, vocational evaluations, job placement, resume preparation, job seeking skills training, and education/retraining expenses for a new occupation (effective 7/1/2009). A written rehabilitation plan will be provided to the beneficiary.
<EOS>
Under the Unum Cert 4767299 policy, a supplementary disability benefit of 10% (up to $1,000 per month) is provided in addition to your regular disability payment. This extra benefit isn't affected by Deductible Sources of Income provisions that might otherwise increase or decrease the amount. However, the Total Benefit Cap applies.

During the period you are participating in the Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program and cannot find employment after your disability ends, Unum will provide monthly payments for a duration of three months from the end date of your disability. This payment may be given as a lump sum.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, the Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program benefits will cease on the earliest of these dates: (1) when Unum determines you're no longer eligible for the program, or (2) any other date where monthly payments would stop under this plan.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Cert 4767299.pdf at page 27, row 6, your gross disability payment under this policy is determined by comparing the two amounts specified: the maximum monthly benefit and your actual monthly earnings prior to disability. If your earnings are lower than the maximum monthly benefit, that lower figure will serve as your gross disability payment. The maximum monthly benefit is subject to change based on factors such as inflation and policy updates. This comparison determines the amount you receive during the period of your disability, subject to any policy limitations or exclusions.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 27, rows 1-5, the monthly benefit you receive from this policy, encompassing all benefits provided under the plan, will not exceed 100% of your earnings. However, if you participate in Unum's Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program, the combined monthly benefit will not surpass 110% of your income.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, pages [27, 28], the term "Monthly Earnings" for Physician Partners/Owners is determined by averaging Schedule K-1 and W-2 income over the lesser of three tax years or the time as an owner (if less than 3 years). This sum is derived from "ordinary income (loss) from trade or business activities" in Schedule K-1 and "wages, tips, and other compensation" on the W-2 form. It includes pre-tax earnings before any tax contributions to a qualified deferred compensation plan, but excludes allowances, such as car or housing, Employer contributions to plans, and income from non-Employer sources.

   For Physicians, FT Administrator & President, "Monthly Earnings" can be calculated either by the W-2 income for the year prior to disability or over their employment period if no W-2 was issued beforehand. The "average gross monthly income" is the total earnings before taxes, without deductions for pre-tax contributions, Section 125 plans, or flexible spending accounts, and excludes allowances, Employer plan contributions, and income from non-Employer sources. This information was updated on LTD-BEN-3 (7/1/2009).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, if the outcome of Item 1 equals or falls below 100% of your indexed monthly earnings, no further payment reduction is made. Conversely, when it exceeds 100%, Unum deducts the excess from your monthly payment. After a year of payments while working, you will receive payments relative to the disability-induced income loss percentage.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, the percentage of lost earnings is calculated by dividing your disability benefit by your indexed monthly earnings (as stated on page 28, row 27). This means that the percentage represents how much of your original income you are receiving during your period of disability. The calculation ensures fair compensation while taking into account any changes in your income over time.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf (page numbers 28, 29), your monthly disability payment will be multiplied by the figure provided in Item 2. Unum may request proof of your disability earnings at least quarterly, and adjust payments based on these quarters. Required financial records to substantiate income might include appropriate documents. After the elimination period, if disabled for less than a month, you receive 1/30th of the payment per day. This policy follows LTD-BEN-4 (7/1/2009). The payment details are outlined on rows [30, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 2, 3, 1, 2].
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 29 rows 6, 7, and 8, the benefits you may receive are governed by a workers' compensation law, an occupational disease law, or any other legislation with similar intent. The percentage of wages replaced can vary, but in most cases, it will not exceed 2/3 of your pre-disability earnings. These benefits are subject to federal income tax and may also be subject to state taxes. Any potential future increases in the benefit amount will be based on cost-of-living adjustments. You have up to five years from the date you stopped working or became disabled, whichever is later, to file a claim for benefits under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, the disability income amount you receive is subject to certain conditions. Exclusions apply to any state compulsory benefit act or law, other group insurance plans, and governmental retirement system benefits stemming from your employment with your Employer. Specifically, payments received under these sources do not affect your disability income eligibility or amount. For instance, if you receive a state disability benefit or are enrolled in a group insurance plan unrelated to your job, these payments will not reduce the disability income benefits provided by this policy. Conversely, any governmental retirement system benefits derived from your Employer's employment will not be included as part of your disability income. This information can be found on pages 29, rows 11, 13, 14, and 15 of the document.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 29 (rows 18-23), the disability payments you may receive due to your incapacity are contingent on benefits from various sources. These include Social Security Act of the United States, Canada Pension Plan, Quebec Pension Plan, and any similar plans or legislation. The total amount you, your spouse, and children collectively receive will be reduced by the combined disability payments derived from these sources. The exact percentage of reduction depends on the specific plan, but it may not exceed 85% in aggregate. It is essential to note that if a beneficiary receives Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI), they will be considered as having no disability for Unum's purposes.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, under section related to retirement payments (page 29, rows 26-32), if you receive retirement benefits from the United States Social Security Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the Quebec Pension Plan, or any similar plan/act, your dependent children may also receive these payments. This provision applies if you pass away before reaching the normal retirement age of your respective pension plan. The amount your dependents receive is a percentage of your retirement benefit, determined by the specific plan's rules.
<EOS>
This information from Unum Cert 4767299.pdf reveals that disability payments under your employer's retirement plan are defined as those benefits paid due to disability that do not reduce the retirement benefit if no disability occurred. Retirement payments, on the other hand, are based on your employer's contributions to the retirement plan. Disability benefits reducing the retirement benefit will also be considered as a retirement benefit.

Unum considers both your and your employer's contributions to be distributed simultaneously throughout your lifetime, regardless of distribution methods. The definition of an eligible retirement plan is according to Section 402 of the Internal Revenue Code, including any future amendments. Additionally, amounts received do not include rolled over or transferred amounts to any eligible retirement plan. This is valid from July 1st, 2009 onwards.
<EOS>
Under Unum's policy as outlined in Cert 4767299.pdf, except for retirement payments, only deductible income stemming from the same disability will be subtracted from your benefit. This does not include Social Security retirement income if your disability commences post-age 65, provided you were already receiving Social Security retirement benefits prior to this disability onset. The Jones Act applies throughout these stipulations.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, when deductible income sources are subtracted from your gross disability payment, Unum will not subsequently adjust the payment due to any cost-of-living increases derived from that specific source. Essentially, once these income sources have been accounted for in the initial payment calculation, they no longer impact subsequent adjustments tied to cost-of-living increases.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, the lifetime cumulative maximum benefit period for disabilities due to mental illness is 24 months. Benefits will not exceed this limit regardless of whether the disabilities are continuous or unrelated. However, payments may continue beyond the 24-month period if you meet specific conditions as outlined in LTD-BEN-8 (7/1/2009). The document is found on pages [32, 33] with related information at rows [1, 2, 4, 2, 3, 1, 3, 4].
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 33, rows 7-15, during your hospital confinement beyond the initial 24-month period, benefits will continue. If you remain disabled post-discharge, further payments are granted for a recovery period of up to 90 days. Rehospitalization within this recovery phase, persisting for at least 14 days consecutively, triggers additional payment during this confinement and another 90-day recovery period.
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 4767299.pdf policy detail (pages 33, rows [18-19, 20, 22-23, 25, 27-28, 29, 30-31, 32, 33]) outlines that if you continue to be disabled after the initial 24-month payment period, and are hospitalized or institutionalized for 14 consecutive days, Unum will provide further payments during your reconfinement. Payments will cease either upon reaching the specified limited pay period or maximum payment duration, whichever comes first. The policy does not apply a mental illness limitation to dementia stemming from stroke, trauma, viral infection, Alzheimer's disease, or other conditions not typically treated by mental health providers using psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or similar treatments.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, a pre-existing condition is defined as having received medical treatment, consultation, care, or services (including diagnostic measures) or taken prescribed drugs or medicines within the three months preceding your effective date of coverage. If your disability starts within the first 12 months after coverage activation, it will be considered a pre-existing condition.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, if your disability recurs within 6 months of the end of a prior claim while being continuously insured under the plan, it will be treated as an extension of the previous claim and you will not have to meet another elimination period. Conversely, any recurrence after 6 months will be considered a new claim subject to all policy provisions, including the elimination period. It is essential to note that if you become entitled to payments under any other group long-term disability plan, you will no longer be eligible for benefits under this Unum plan (effective as of 7/1/2009).
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 4767299.pdf section (rows [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 30, 32, 33] on page [35]) outlines the survivor benefit and terminal illness option. If you have been receiving disability payments for over 180 days and die, your eligible survivors receive a lump sum equal to 3 months of your gross disability payment. If there are no eligible survivors, the payment goes to the estate. However, any overpayment on your claim will be addressed first.

If diagnosed terminally ill with a life expectancy less than 12 months and receiving monthly payments, you may receive a lump sum equivalent to 3 months of gross disability payments. To do so, you must make this election in writing to Unum and have a physician certify your terminal illness and reduced life expectancy. This benefit is available once on a voluntary basis and will replace the 3-month survivor benefit upon your death.
<EOS>
Upon policy activation with Unum, coverage is granted if you are jobless due to illness or injury and were previously insured. Coverage is contingent upon premium payment. Your premium will match the amount your prior carrier would have paid. Any liability owed to your previous carrier will result in a corresponding reduction of your payments. This information can be found on Unum  Cert 4767299.pdf pages 35 and 36, rows 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 2, 3 (LTD-OTR-2, 7/1/2009).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, if your employer changes insurance carriers to Unum and your disability is due to a pre-existing condition, you may receive a payment. To be eligible, you must have been in active employment and insured under the plan on its effective date, and insured by the prior policy at the time of change.

Payments will be determined based on whether you satisfy the pre-existing condition provision under either the Unum plan or the prior carrier's plan. If you do not meet these conditions, no payments will be made. If you satisfy one or both conditions, your payment will be the lesser of the monthly benefit that would have been payable under the terms of the prior plan if it had remained in force, or the monthly payment under the Unum plan.

Your benefits will cease on the earlier of the end of the maximum benefit period under the plan, or the date they would have ended under the prior plan if it had remained in force.

<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4767299 on page 39 rows [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12], Disability Plus benefits are payable when proof of disability under this rider and concurrent monthly payments under the LTD plan are received. The onset of benefits commences at the end of the elimination period specified in the LTD plan. A person is considered disabled when Unum deems that due to sickness or injury, they lose the ability to perform 2 activities of daily living without assistance or verbal cues, or there's a deterioration or loss in intellectual capacity necessitating such aid.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, the Disability Plus benefit is calculated as 20% of your monthly earnings, with a maximum monthly payout of either $5,000 or the limit set by the LTD plan. This benefit isn't influenced by policy provisions apart from the Total Benefit Cap, which may modify the amount based on Deductible Sources of Income.
<EOS>
According to the Disability Plus Rider in Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, certain coverage exclusions and limitations apply.

The coverage begins after a 180-day elimination period, with benefits payable up to the policy maximum of $6,500 per month for a duration of either 5 or 10 years or until age 67. Additionally, there is a residual benefit option available that pays a reduced percentage of your monthly benefit if you are able to perform some, but not all, of your regular duties. Premiums can be paid monthly, quarterly, or annually, and you have the flexibility to change premium payment methods once per calendar year. This policy definition does not include self-employed individuals unless they are covered under a group contract.

All of these classes must be citizens or legal residents of the United States, its territories, and protectorates, excluding temporary, leased, or seasonal employees. Full-time Employment requires a minimum of 25 hours weekly (excluding on-call hours), while Part-time Employment necessitates at least 20 hours weekly (again, disregarding on-call hours).
<EOS>
In accordance with the eligibility waiting period outlined in Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 9, rows 2, 3, 1, and 2, new employees fall under three classes (1, 2, and 3). For existing employees, coverage begins on the policy effective date; for newly hired employees, coverage commences on their date of hire. This means that benefits will only be activated after the specified waiting period has elapsed for both sets of employees, regardless of their employment class.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on page 9, row 2, the Elimination Period for Classes 1, 2, and 3 is 90 days. This means that following an eligible event, no benefits will be paid during the initial 90-day period. After this waiting period, should further qualifying events occur, benefits will be disbursed as outlined in the policy. The Elimination Period applies to all specified insurance classes, i.e., classes 1, 2, and 3.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, the maximum monthly benefit is determined as follows: It's the minimum of three amounts - $15,000 for Class 1, $5,000 for Class 2, or $10,000 for Class 3. Alternatively, it could be the Benefit Percentage applicable to the policyholder multiplied by their Pre-disability Earnings on which premium has been paid. It could also be the Benefit Percentage multiplied by their Pre-disability Earnings, or the amount of coverage in excess of the Guaranteed Issue that has been approved and for which premium has been paid.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 9, rows 1-6, the Minimum Monthly Benefit is the greater of two values: either $100 or 10% of the Maximum Monthly Benefit you're eligible for under this policy, before accounting for Other Income Benefits. The Guaranteed Issue Amounts are $15,000 for Class 1, $5,000 for Class 2, and $10,000 for Class 3. These details may affect the amount of benefits you receive from this policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on page 10 row 1, Class 1's Secondary Benefit Percentage is set at 70%. This means that, in the event of a claim, this policy will provide secondary benefits equating to 70% of the coverage amount for the associated costs. It is essential to note that any primary coverage would still take precedence over this secondary benefit. The percentage and benefit details may differ for other classes or policies, so it's crucial to review your specific insurance documentation for accurate information regarding your coverage.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, benefit payable periods depend on your age and normal retirement age (NRA), defined by the 1983 revision of the United States Social Security Act and determined by your birthdate. If you retire before reaching NRA but within 48 months, benefits are paid for up to 48 months. Between Age 63 and NRA or 42 months if greater, payable periods range from 36 to 18 months, with a decrease every 1-3 months. Once you reach NRA, the payable period is 12 months. Benefits cease after NRA+18 months. For instance, if your NRA is 67, benefits would last for 30 months before age 65, then 24 months from age 66 to 67, and finally 12 months from age 67 onwards.

If elected for lifetime payments, the amount will be reduced by approximately 4% per annum. The initial payment percentage varies based on the chosen payout option and ranges from 50% to 100%.

However, should the COLA rider be waived or declined initially, it cannot be added later without proof of good health.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, under the Workplace Modification Benefit, the policy provides coverage for necessary workplace modifications after an injury.

According to the Cost-Of-Living Adjustment (COLA) section of Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, if your policy includes this benefit, the monthly annuity amount will adjust annually based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

The benefit is available for qualifying conditions including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Multiple Sclerosis, among others. To qualify, the policyholder must be diagnosed by a licensed medical practitioner and unable to perform at least two of six activities of daily living or suffer from severe cognitive impairment.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on page 11 row 1, the policy provides a lump-sum payment in case of total disability due to sickness or injury. The disability must prevent you from performing the material and substantial duties of your own occupation for a continuous period of 24 months or result in death. The policy pays 60% of the monthly benefit amount during the elimination period, which is the first 90 days, followed by 75% of the monthly benefit amount thereafter. The maximum period of disability benefits is to age 67 or until you return to work on a full-time basis, whichever comes first. The policy also includes a residual benefit if you can still perform some of the material and substantial duties of your own occupation but with a 20% or more loss of indexed pre-disability earnings due to sickness or injury.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, individuals belonging to the classes listed in the Schedule of Insurance are considered Eligible Persons for coverage. The eligibility criteria do not explicitly state any restrictions based on age, gender, or nationality. However, specific details regarding the scope and duration of coverage, as well as the benefits provided, should be found within the respective sections of the policy document. It is crucial to note that any changes to this eligibility may require updates to the Schedule of Insurance.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, you will become eligible for coverage on the later of two dates: either the Policy Effective Date or the date when you complete the Eligibility Waiting Period for Coverage shown in the Schedule of Insurance, if applicable. The eligibility waiting period may vary depending on your specific policy details. To summarize, once either the effective date has passed or the specified waiting period is completed (if required), you will be eligible for coverage under this policy.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf (page 11), it is stated that all eligible Active Employees will be automatically enrolled if no contribution is made towards coverage costs. If contributions are made, enrollment requires completing and signing a group insurance form, satisfactory to the provider, and delivering it to the employer within a specified time frame. Failure to enroll within 31 days after eligibility or during prior policy periods could necessitate providing Evidence of Insurability. Additionally, if the Monthly Benefit Amount exceeds the Guaranteed Issue Amount at the time of enrollment, such evidence may also be required.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, Evidence of Insurability is essential for policy approval and may involve a completed application, medical examination, attending Physician's statements, and additional information as required by the company. This evidence must be provided at your expense. If the provided evidence is unsatisfactory, your monthly benefit will equal the amount you were eligible for without providing Evidence of Insurability if enrolled within 31 days of eligibility, but coverage under the policy will not be available if enrollment occurs more than 31 days after initial eligibility.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on page 11, your insurance coverage commences under specific conditions detailed below. If you're exempt from paying premiums, your policy becomes effective once you become eligible. Otherwise, if you contribute towards the cost of the policy:

1) Your coverage starts immediately if you enroll by the time you become eligible for benefits that don't require Evidence of Insurability (EOI).

2) Alternatively, if you enroll within 31 days following your eligibility date for non-EOI benefits, your policy activates on the enrollment date.

3) Lastly, if your coverage requires EOI, your insurance will start on the date we approve your Evidence of Insurability submission.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 11 and 12, your insurance coverage or increase in coverage will be deferred if you're absent from work due to accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse, or pregnancy, on the date your insurance would otherwise have started. The effective date for coverage will be delayed until you actively return to work for a full day. This exception applies to situations where the absence occurs within 12 days before the scheduled start date of your policy or increased coverage.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, your insurance coverage may vary with a change in class or pre-disability earnings. An increase in coverage requires you to be an active employee and not absent due to disability on the day of change. If absent, the effective date will defer until you return to work for one full day. The Guaranteed Issue Amount limits all increases, but after Evidence of Insurability approval beyond this limit, further increases will only need additional evidence if they exceed 10% or have been 3 years since last approval. Notifications of changes in pre-disability earnings are effective upon receipt. An Employer-initiated change in policy becomes effective on the date of the change, subject to deferred effective date and pre-existing conditions limitations.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, if you were insured under a prior policy and ineligible for benefits on the day before the current policy's effective date, no deferred effective date applies. If you transitioned from the prior policy to the current one on the effective date and had coverage in the prior policy the day before, the pre-existing condition limitation ends on the earliest of either the policy effective date if there was no such restriction under the prior policy or the date the restriction would have ended had the prior policy remained active. The monthly benefit for a pre-existing condition will be the lesser of what was paid by the prior policy or the current policy's provision. The pre-existing conditions limitation applies after the effective date to any increase in benefits resulting from switching policies, changing options, classes, or the policy itself. If you received disability benefits under the prior policy and returned to work before the current policy's effective date, and subsequently have a recurrence of the same disability within 6 months of returning to work, covered without an elimination period under the prior policy, the elimination period under the current policy will be waived.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, your coverage terminates on the earliest occasion of:

1. The policy termination date.
2. The point when the policy no longer covers your specified class.
3. Premium payment due dates that are not met.
4. The final day of a premium contribution period you're required to pay.
5. Your employer ending your employment or you ceasing to be an active employee in an eligible class for any reason, excluding continuation provisions.

The coverage persists only if extended according to any Continuation Provisions.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, coverage can be extended beyond termination if your employer provides a uniform plan and pays premiums. Continued coverage is subject to Policy reductions, terminates upon Policy or class termination, and maintains your benefit level as of the day before continuation.

Leave of absence (except Family/Medical) allows 30 days' continuation post-commencement; FMLA/similar leave provides up to 12 weeks' continuation. Sabbatical leaves for Classes 1 and 3 offer coverage until the 12th month following sabbatical commencement, with pre-approval required for sabbaticals exceeding 30 days. Continuation ceases immediately upon leave termination prior to agreed duration.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 14, rows 2-6, if you become disabled and cease being an active employee, your insurance will continue during the Elimination Period as long as you remain disabled by the same disability. After this period, coverage is maintained for as long as you are entitled to benefits under the policy. The Elimination Period's length may vary depending on the specific details of your case.
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 14, rows 2-6, premiums will not be required once the elimination period has passed and as long as benefits continue to be disbursed during the disability period. This waiver of premium applies only after the elimination period ends. The policy does not specify a fixed duration for this exemption; however, it continues as long as benefits remain payable. It's essential to note that this provision is applicable solely to you, the policyholder, during the disability phase.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, if you are receiving disability benefits and the policy terminates, these benefits will continue as long as your disability persists using the same definition. However, benefits will not be provided beyond the date when payments would have ceased had the insurance remained active. The termination of the policy for any reason does not affect this provision's liability. In essence, if the policy ends but you remain disabled by the same condition, your benefits will continue until the disability ends or the date that benefits would have stopped had the policy remained active, whichever comes first.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf (pages 14-15), if your insurance terminates due to employment ending (non-retirement) or ineligibility from an eligible class, and you've been continuously insured for at least 12 months, are under the Policy Age Limit, can perform duties of your Occupation, the policy/class has not terminated, you're not eligible for another class or similar benefits, then you're eligible to enroll in a group long-term disability conversion policy. To convert, send a written request within 31 days, including payment of the premium and enrollment fee. Coverage will be issued without evidence of insurability, effective the day after termination, and terms may vary based on time of enrollment. If eligible, a certificate of insurance under the conversion policy will be issued.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 15, rows 2-12, this policy provides disability benefits for the policyholder if they become disabled while insured and meet certain conditions. The policyholder must be disabled throughout the Elimination Period, remain disabled beyond it, and submit proof of loss to the insurance company. Benefits start on the first day following the Elimination Period and are paid monthly. However, these benefits will not exceed the Maximum Duration of Benefits.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, if your disability is due to mental illness from any cause, related conditions, alcoholism, or non-medical substance abuse (narcotics, sedatives, stimulants, hallucinogens, etc.), there's a limit on the maximum duration of benefits. Payments will be made: 1) while you're confined in a hospital or medical care facility for your disabling condition; or 2) if not confined, after discharge and during ongoing disability, for a total of 24 months across all such disabilities throughout your lifetime.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf (page 15, rows [2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3]), if you recover from disability but then become disabled again within 180 days due to the same or a related cause while the policy remains active, these separate periods will be considered one continuous period of disability. However, if you are not disabled for 180 days or more, any subsequent disability will be treated as a new one, subject to a fresh elimination period and a new maximum duration of benefits, and all other policy terms in effect at that time will apply. Any periods of recovery during the elimination period that last less than half its length will not extend the elimination period.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf at pages 15, rows 2 and 1, the term "Recover" or "Recovery" denotes that the insured individual is no longer disabled and has resumed employment with their original employer while premiums are still being paid under Class 1. This suggests a return to work for the disabled claimant within this specific context without any loss of benefits in the stated class, assuming the conditions are met as per policy stipulations.

According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, if you become permanently disabled and earn 20% or less of your pre-disability earnings, your monthly disability benefits are calculated by multiplying your pre-disability earnings with the benefit percentage. This multiplied amount is then compared with the maximum benefit; the lesser amount is used, subtracting any other income benefits to determine your final monthly benefit.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, during the Disability period, if you earn more than 20% of your Pre-disability Earnings, your Monthly Benefit is calculated as follows: multiply your Pre-Disability Earnings by the Benefit Percentage, compare the result with the Maximum Benefit, and from the lesser amount, deduct Other Income Benefits. The result is Your Monthly Benefit. Current Monthly Earnings will not reduce it. However, if the sum of your Monthly Benefit and your Current Monthly Earnings exceeds 100% of your Pre-disability Earnings, we will reduce your Monthly Benefit by the excess amount. The 12 consecutive month period starts on either the day you first start work earning more than 20% or the end of the Elimination Period. If you're not under the Return to Work Incentive but earn over 20%, we will calculate your Monthly Benefit using either the Proportionate Loss Formula or the 50% Offset Formula, whichever is greater. This period starts when you're disabled and earning more than 20%.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf (page 16, row 5), the policy outlines an Indexed Pre-disability Earnings benefit. This benefit is payable if you become disabled and are not earning more than 20% of your pre-disability earnings. The benefit amount is indexed, meaning it adjusts over time based on changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). To qualify for this benefit, you must provide evidence of your pre-disability earnings, which will be adjusted according to the CPI at the time of disability and annually thereafter. This benefit continues until you are no longer disabled or reach the policy's maximum period of payment.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf document outlines the Monthly Benefit (W) in case of disability, limiting payments if you earn more than 20% of your pre-disability earnings. The benefit is indexed, meaning it may adjust over time based on changes to cost-of-living. To be eligible, you must not exceed this 20% income threshold during your disability period. This information can be found on page 16, row 3 of the certificate.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf (page 16, rows 1-5, 1-2, 1), it is stated that if the sum of your Monthly Benefit, Current Monthly Earnings, and Other Income Benefits exceeds 100% of your Pre-disability Earnings, the excess will be deducted from your Monthly Benefit. However, your Monthly Benefit will never fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit. Additionally, overpayments may be subject to recovery in accordance with the Overpayment Recovery provision. For Classes 2 and 3, specifics apply.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on page 17, row 5, your monthly benefit in the event of disability will be based on your Indexed Pre-disability Earnings, provided they do not exceed 20% of your pre-disability earnings. This percentage is crucial, as earning more than this could impact your eligibility for benefits. The Indexed Pre-disability Earnings are adjusted annually to account for changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This adjustment ensures your benefit amount keeps pace with inflation.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf (page 17), it is stated that if the sum of your Monthly Benefit, Current Monthly Earnings, and Other Income Benefits exceeds 100% of your Pre-disability Earnings, your Monthly Benefit will be reduced by the excess amount. However, your benefit will never fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit. If an overpayment occurs, they may recover all or part of it according to their Overpayment Recovery provision.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, your Monthly Benefit under this policy will never fall below the specified Minimum Monthly Benefit as outlined in the Schedule of Insurance (page 17, row 2). The minimum amount ensures a certain level of financial support during your policy period. This Minimum Monthly Benefit serves as a safety net to prevent any significant reduction in benefits provided under this contract.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 17 and 18, if a Monthly Benefit is payable for a period less than a month, the calculated benefit will be 1/30 of the Monthly Benefit for each day you are disabled. This means that if your disability lasts for 15 days, for instance, you would receive (15/30) of your Monthly Benefit. This applies to rows [2, 3, 1].
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on page 18 rows [2-23], your benefit payments will cease upon the earliest of nine circumstances:

1. Your disability status change.
2. Insufficient proof of loss submission.
3. Discontinuation of regular medical care unless further treatment is deemed unnecessary.
4. Refusal to undergo requested physician examination or other professional evaluation.
5. Your demise.
6. Refusal of recommended treatment generally accepted by physicians as curative, corrective, or beneficial for your disabling condition.
7. The last day benefits are payable according to the Maximum Duration of Benefits Table.
8. If you're receiving occupation-based disability benefits, your current monthly earnings exceeding 80% of your indexed pre-disability earnings.
9. Any provision in the policy limiting benefit duration takes effect.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, if you're participating in a Rehabilitation program and incur Family Care expenses for children under age 13 or dependent, mentally or physically handicapped family members, these costs will be deducted from your rehabilitation earnings. The maximum monthly deduction per qualifying child or family member is $350 during the first 12 months of Rehab and $175 thereafter, not exceeding your monthly earnings. This deduction may not surpass a total of $2,500 annually, and it will be reduced proportionally for periods less than a month. Caregiver receipts are required to document charges, and this deduction ends when you exit the Rehabilitation program or after 24 months of Family Care Credits during your Disability. Family Care provided by relatives is ineligible as a deduction under this provision. Your post-deduction current monthly earnings determine your Monthly Benefit, and you won't be eligible for a Monthly Benefit if your pre-deduction earnings exceed 80% of your Indexed Pre-disability Earnings.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf pages [18, 19], if you're receiving a Monthly Disability Benefit at the time of your death, a Survivor Income Benefit will be paid upon receipt of satisfactory proof of death and entitlement to the benefit within one year of your demise. The beneficiary can either be your surviving spouse, your children (in equal shares if no spouse), or your estate if neither exists. The Survivor Income Benefit is three times your Maximum Monthly Benefit. To change or designate a beneficiary, a written notice must be filed with us on any satisfactory form, and any changes take effect as of the date you signed the notice. Overpayments will first be applied to the Survivor Income Benefit. If no written notice is received, we are not liable for benefit payments.
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf (page 19, rows 2-4), a "Spouse" may be either your legally married wife or husband at the time of your death, or your domestic partner if you have executed an acceptable domestic partner affidavit and continue to meet its requirements. To be considered a domestic partner for The Policy, you must submit a valid affidavit establishing that you and your partner are recognized as such. Your designation as a domestic partner will persist so long as you adhere to the conditions described in the affidavit.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, a Surviving Child is defined as your unmarried, biologically or adopted offspring who either reside with you in a parent-child relationship and were eligible to be claimed as dependents on your last federal income tax return prior to your death, or are primarily dependent on you for support and maintenance. This includes children under age 21, as well as those aged 21 to 25 who are enrolled full-time at an educational institution. If a minor child is entitled to benefits, the insurance company may opt to make payments to their caregiver until a legal guardian is appointed.
<EOS>
According to the Workplace Modification Benefit section from Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, if your disability is covered and your employer agrees to make necessary modifications to accommodate your return to work, the insurer will reimburse these costs up to the amount of the Maximum Monthly Benefit item. Approval for such modifications requires written consent from the insurer. The insurer may choose to evaluate you by a physician, vocational expert, or rehabilitation specialist before approval. Reimbursement occurs after the proposed modifications are completed, proof of expenses is provided, and you return as an Active Employee. This benefit is applicable only if your disability is covered under the policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf (page 19, rows 2-3), Workplace Modification refers to alterations in your work environment or job performance methods, aimed at enabling you to execute the essential duties of your position while disabled. Payment of this benefit does not diminish or exclude any other benefits you're entitled to under the policy's terms.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, this policy offers a Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) after 12 consecutive months of disability. To be eligible, one must be receiving benefits and earning less than 20% of pre-disability earnings. The COLA is adjusted annually on January 1st using the lesser of 3% or the full percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The formula multiplies this percentage by the Monthly Benefit for Disability and adds it to the existing benefit. However, these adjustments cease upon cessation of disability or termination of the policy.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, rows [2, 3, 4, 1, 2] on page 20, details the Consumer Price Index (CPI-W), published monthly by the U.S. Department of Labor. The index measures urban wage earners and clerical workers' expenses for specific goods and services. If discontinued or changed, an equivalent nationally published index will be used instead. For this benefit, the CPI-W percentage change is calculated as the difference between July 31's CPI-W of the current year and the prior year, divided by the prior year's CPI-W.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf outlines the Infectious and Contagious Disease Benefit. To qualify for this benefit, you must provide verification that you carry an infectious and contagious disease listed by the Center for Disease Control as life-threatening; tested positive for it after the policy's effective date; have suffered a 20% or greater loss of earnings due to limitations on your license, reduced patronage, or loss of patients resulting from disclosure of the disease; and never refused immunization against the specific disease.

The benefit is calculated as follows: (Pre-disability Earnings - Current Monthly Earnings) x (Maximum Benefit payable under the Policy) = Your Infectious and Contagious Disease Benefit, payable monthly. The benefit will cease on the earliest of your death, disability eligibility, our determination that you have not made efforts to continue working in your occupation, your refusal to participate in seeking suitable alternate work, or the policy's maximum duration of benefits.
<EOS>
Under the Progressive Illness Benefit outlined in Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, if you are diagnosed with a progressive illness after becoming covered for this benefit and provide proof from your physician, you may become eligible to receive this benefit. The coverage requires that you have been covered by the policy, and upon diagnosis of a progressive illness, you must supply satisfactory proof from your physician to qualify. The specifics of the benefit details are not provided in these sections but can be found elsewhere in the document.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf policy section details a Progressive Illness disability benefit. A non-infectious, prolonged disease or disorder, progressively impacting one's ability to perform their own occupation, qualifies as a Progressive Illness. If disabled due to such an illness, your pre-disability earnings will be the greater of two options: the earnings at the time you provide proof of your progressive illness from your physician, or the earnings at the time of disability under this policy. Disability benefits are calculated using these determined earnings and adhering to the policy's terms effective on the disability date. Premiums will be based on either pre-disability earnings for this benefit or for the entire policy before disability occurs until you meet the disability criteria, with premiums not dropping below the amount at proof of illness submission unless you qualify for Waiver of Premium.
<EOS>
Under the Accidental Dismemberment and Loss of Sight Benefit in The Hartford's policy (Cert 5408131), if you sustain a bodily injury due to an accident within the coverage period, we will pay a monthly benefit for any of the listed losses that occur within 90 days after the accident. The benefit is payable only when the loss persists for at least the specified number of months indicated in the policy. The benefits are as follows:

These benefits begin after an elimination period and are subject to the terms and conditions outlined in the policy.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf outlines various minimum number of monthly benefit payments for different types of loss scenarios. For instance, the full amount is payable if both eyes, both hands, or both feet are lost; if one hand and one foot, one hand and one eye, or one foot and one eye are lost, a reduced payment is made. Similarly, a partial payment is given for losing one hand or one foot, while the least compensation is provided for losing one eye. Additionally, there's a specific payment for the thumb and index finger of either hand.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, loss refers primarily to the actual severance of hands, feet, or specific fingers (hands and feet through or above wrist/ankle joints; eyes, entire and irrecoverable; thumb and index finger through or above metacarpophalangeal joints) as a result of an accident. If multiple losses occur from the same incident, the number of monthly benefit payments is limited to the loss with the greatest number of payments indicated in the schedule. Benefit payments may continue if the policyholder remains disabled after the Minimum Number of Monthly Benefit Payments has been reached. If death occurs before the minimum number of payments are made during the Elimination Period, remaining payments will be made to the estate.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, benefits will not be paid for any disability under this policy if the claimant is not under regular medical care, or if the disability is caused by war or act of war (declared or undeclared), commission or attempt of a felony, illegal occupation, self-inflicted injury, or if benefits were received or were eligible from a prior employer-sponsored disability plan that was terminated before the policy's effective date.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 22, rows 2-8, the policy does not cover any benefits or increases for disabilities resulting from pre-existing conditions, unless the insured has not received medical care for that condition during the past six consecutive months while under the policy, or has been continuously insured for twelve consecutive months prior to becoming disabled.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf (page 22, rows 2-11), any pre-existing conditions including injuries, sicknesses, mental illnesses, pregnancies, or substance abuse issues are not covered if they resulted in medical care during the 6 months preceding either your effective date of coverage or a change in coverage. This includes manifestations, symptoms, findings, or aggravations relating to these conditions.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 22 rows 2-5, medical care is covered when a physician or healthcare provider consults, gives advice, recommends, prescribes, or provides treatment.

<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 23, rows 2-11, written Proof of Loss for a claim must be sent within 90 days following the commencement of the period for which payment is liable.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, if you are deemed disabled and eligible for benefits, payments will be issued at the end of each month that you're disabled.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 23, all payments for your claim are made directly to you. In the event of your demise, such payments may be distributed to your estate. If a payment is owed to your estate, a minor, or an incompetent person, up to $1,000 can be paid to a relative who, at the insurer's discretion, is entitled to it, fulfilling their obligation for the amount paid.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, if a claim for benefits is either fully or partially denied, written notification will be provided, outlining specific reasons for denial, referencing relevant policy provisions, describing any additional information required to complete a claim, and explaining why it's necessary.

According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 24 rows 2-8, you must apply for Social Security disability benefits when your disability lasts the minimum required duration. You have 45 days from the date of their request to submit your application. If denied, you must follow the Social Security Administration's process to reconsider the denial and, if denied again, request a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge at the Office of Hearing and Appeals.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf states that the company reserves the right to decrease disability benefits by estimating potential Social Security benefits for you or your dependents. This reduction applies if you or your dependents appear eligible for these benefits. However, your monthly benefit will not be reduced if:

  1) You apply for and pursue appeals according to Social Security regulations, and provide authorization for the Social Security Administration to share award information with them.

2) You sign a reimbursement agreement confirming that you accept repaying any overpayments.

If we reduce your monthly benefit based on an estimate and:

  1) You or your dependents later receive Social Security disability benefits, we will adjust the monthly benefit upon receiving proof of the award amount, determining if it was higher or lower than our estimate.

2) Your application for Social Security disability benefits is denied, we will make an adjustment when you provide us proof of final denial from an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Hearing and Appeals.

If our estimated Social Security Benefits were lower, and we owe you a refund, we will issue it in a lump sum. Conversely, if they were higher, and your monthly benefit has been overpaid, you must return a lump sum equal to all overpayments, as per the Overpayment Recovery provision.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 24 and 25, an overpayment occurs when the insurer determines that benefits paid exceed what is due under The Policy, or when payments are made for another group policy. This includes retroactive awards, unreported/late reported Other Income Benefits or earned income, misstatements, fraud, errors, or any other reasons. Overpayments can arise from various factors such as failure to report Other Income Benefits, late notification of earnings, or incorrect information provided.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf (pages 25-26) outlines the policy on overpayment recovery. The insurance company has the right to recover any determined overpayments, with the policyholder obligated to refund this amount. Overpayments on claims must be reimbursed within 30 days, or else the company can recover from the policyholder, other organizations, insurance companies, those to whom payment was made, or the policyholder's estate. Additionally, the company may reduce or offset future benefits payable until full reimbursement is made. Delinquent payments may be referred to a collection agency, and legal action can be taken in court to recover overpayments. Payments may continue once the overpayment has been recovered.
<EOS>
According to the Subrogation section of the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf (pages 26, rows 2-10), if you incur a Disability due to a Third Party's actions or omissions, receive benefits for lost wages under this Policy, and fail to initiate legal action against that party within a reasonable timeframe, the insurance company will be subrogated to any rights you may have against them. The company then reserves the option to bring a lawsuit against the Third Party to recover payments made in relation to your Disability.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 26 rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], if you recover payment from a third party due to a disability for which benefits were paid or are required under the policy, the company has the right to be reimbursed for the lesser of the benefit payments made or the amount recovered from the third party, less any reasonable legal fees associated with the recovery. This reimbursement applies to recoveries via legal judgment, arbitration award, settlement, or otherwise. The reimbursement must be made in the amount specified, not exceeding the benefit payments made or required under the policy for that disability.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, page 26 row 2, "Third Party" refers to any individual or legal entity whose actions or inactions, wholly or partially, result in the policyholder experiencing a Disability, affecting the benefits payable under The Policy. This implies that if a third party's actions lead to the policyholder becoming disabled, benefits may be paid out as stipulated within the policy terms and conditions.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, legal action against us can only be initiated within specific timeframes: no sooner than 60 days following the provision of proof of loss, or more than 3 years after the date proof of loss is required according to the terms of the policy.

<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 26, rows 2-6 and 1-3, misstatements about your personal facts may lead to adjustments in your premium. If such discrepancies are material, they will affect the coverage duration and amount. However, non-fraudulent statements regarding your insurability won't be used to challenge the policy after it has been active for two years during your lifetime, provided they are in writing and signed by you.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 26 and 27 (rows 2, 3, 4, 1), the insurance provider holds the sole discretion and authority to decide eligibility for benefits, as well as to interpret all terms and provisions of The Policy. This authority extends when The Policy's interpretation is governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 27, rows 2-6 and 1-2, being Actively at Work means performing regular duties of your occupation on a scheduled workday in the usual way for the usual number of hours. For it to count as Actively at Work on a day that is not scheduled, you must have been Actively at Work on the preceding scheduled workday. This policy applies only if you're working for wage or profit.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, an 'Active Employee' is defined as a worker who consistently contributes to the Employer's business on a regular basis, meeting the minimum hours specified in the Schedule of Insurance. The Employee must be employed in the usual course of the Employer's business for this coverage to apply.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, page 27 row 2, any occupation you qualify for by education, training, or experience is considered under this policy, provided your earnings potential exceeds 60% of your indexed pre-disability earnings. This stipulation applies to any occupation, emphasizing that the threshold for return to work is set higher than the standard 20% commonly used in disability insurance policies. The relevant details concerning your pre-disability income and the specific percentage required for you to be deemed capable of returning to work are crucial considerations under this policy.
<EOS>
According to the Bonuses section in the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, monetary bonuses refer to the monthly average of rewards received from an employer during the 12 months prior to your disability onset (if this period is greater than the entirety of your employment), or from any employer or work performed during your disability period. The average includes bonuses earned while actively working for these employers or during the entire employment duration, whichever is shorter.
<EOS>
According to the Commissions section of the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf (page 27, rows 2-8), commissions refer to the monthly average of monetary compensation received from an employer during the 12 months preceding your disability onset, or throughout your entire employment period if it's shorter than 12 months.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf (page 28, rows 3-11), Disability or being Disabled is defined as the inability to perform one or more Essential Duties of your occupation during the Elimination Period, and for the following 24 months if your Current Monthly Earnings are less than 80% of your Indexed Pre-disability Earnings. After that, Disability applies to Any Occupation. If your Current Monthly Earnings exceed 80% of your Pre-disability Earnings at the end of the Elimination Period, your Disability status extends for an additional 12 months or until earnings drop below 80%. A Disability can result from accidental bodily injury, sickness, Mental Illness, Substance Abuse, or pregnancy. Loss of a professional or occupational license does not automatically equate to Disability. However, your Disability must stem from one of the specified causes, and maintaining a license alone does not qualify you as Disabled.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, an Essential Duty is a substantial, fundamental or inherent task in an occupation that cannot be reasonably omitted or changed. Specifically, the ability to work the regular scheduled hours is an Essential Duty. This definition applies to all duties detailed within the policy document.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 28 rows 2, 3, and 4, the term 'Indexed Pre-disability Earnings' refers to your pre-disability earnings adjusted annually by 5%. The first adjustment takes effect one month after receiving 12 months of benefits. Subsequent increases occur annually on the anniversary of the initial adjustment date, compounding at an additional 5% each time. This continuous growth is set in place from the first day of the month following each anniversary.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf (page 28, rows 2-14), 'Mental Illness' refers to disorders listed in the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association. However, it excludes Mental Retardation, Pervasive Developmental Disorders, Motor Skills Disorder, Substance-Related Disorders, Delirium, Dementia, Amnesic and Other Cognitive Disorders, Narcolepsy, and Sleep Disorders related to a General Medical Condition.

If this information is not provided, the entire sum will be assumed to be for loss of income, and the time period will be 60 months.
* The policy may make a retroactive allocation of any retroactive Other Income Benefit, which could result in an overpayment of the claim. The amount of any increase in Other Income Benefits will not be included as Other Income Benefits if such increase takes effect after the date benefits become payable under the policy and is a general increase that applies to all persons entitled to such benefits.

According to the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, Vermont law mandates that health insurers offer coverage equivalent to that given to married individuals to parties involved in a civil union. This requirement applies on row 2 of page 34 within the document.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf section on definitions, terms, conditions, and provisions (rows 4-27 of page 34) specifies that civil unions in Vermont are recognized as marriages.

The definition of "dependent" includes spouses, parties to a Vermont civil union, and children (natural, stepchild, legally adopted, or dependent minors/disabled children) born or brought into the union. A "child or covered child" refers to any child within this criteria.
<EOS>
Under the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, Vermont law extends similar benefits, protections, and responsibilities to civil union parties as married couples under state law. However, some federal benefits, particularly those concerning health insurance, may not be accessible to civil unions due to ERISA regulations governing private employer health plans. Governmental employers (excluding federal government) must provide dependents' health benefits to civil union partners if they do so for spouses. Federal law also governs COBRA continuation rights and Internal Revenue Code treatment of premiums, potentially limiting certain benefits under this policy. Seek expert advice to determine your rights within this contract, and for Washington residents, the term "hyperemesis gravidarum" is deleted from the third paragraph's definition.

According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, the effective date of this policy is August 1, 2001.

According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, the waiting period for disability benefits depends on the employee's enrollment date: For employees who were part of an eligible group before August 1, 2001, there is no specified waiting period. However, for those joining an eligible group after August 1, 2001, the waiting period is either the first of the month coinciding with or following 90 days of continuous active employment.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 5, rows 33-34, if your employment ends and you are rehired within a year, the time spent in an eligible group prior to the termination counts towards meeting the waiting period for policy benefits. All other policy provisions remain applicable.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, if you have been consistently employed for a duration equivalent to your waiting period, Unum will waive the waiting period when you enroll in an eligible group. This waiver is applicable only if you meet the employment duration requirement beforehand. The waiting period waiver does not apply retroactively and coverage will commence from the effective date of your group eligibility. Please refer to specific policy details for the exact waiting period duration, as it may vary based on your employment history with your current employer.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 5, rows 43 and 44, any previous employment period with your employer will be factored into determining your eligibility date's waiting period.

It's essential to note that only work experience with the stated employer is considered in this process.
<EOS>
Under the Unum Cert 4507483 insurance policy, you are responsible for paying the coverage cost. The premium amount is based on factors such as age, health status, and chosen benefit level.

It's essential to note that the elimination period is only applicable to the disability benefits outlined in this policy document.
<EOS>
Under the Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, your monthly disability benefit is set at 60% of your earnings, with a maximum limit of $10,000.

However, certain disabilities might not be covered or may have limited coverage under this policy as specified in B@G-LTD-2 (8/1/2004) REV. It is crucial to note that some disabilities may not be fully covered or may even be excluded from this plan.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, the maximum duration of payments varies based on age at disability. If you become disabled before age 62, payments will continue until age 67.

For three months following the end of your disability, should we deem you no longer disabled and unable to find employment, additional monthly payments will be made. This support is only provided while you are actively participating in the rehabilitation program.
<EOS>
Under Unum's Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program outlined in section 4507483.pdf (page 6, rows 38-45), participants may receive monthly dependent care expense payments. The dependent care expense benefit amount is $350 per month for each eligible dependent, with a combined maximum of $1,000 per month for all such expenses. This assistance aims to help cover eligible dependent care costs while you participate in the program.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, the total monthly benefit received from this policy, including all benefits provided, will not surpass 100% of your earnings (excluding rehabilitation assistance). If you participate in Unum's Rehabilitation and Return to Work program, the total benefit will be capped at 110% of your monthly earnings. These limits apply across the entirety of this plan.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483, page 6 row 59, a pre-existing condition is recognized within the first 12 months of coverage, with benefits payable at 3/12 after the qualifying waiting period. This means that if a claim related to a pre-existing condition is made within the initial 12 months, benefits will be paid starting from the third month following the effective date of coverage, subject to other policy terms and conditions.
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 4507483.pdf (8/1/2004) REV details the Work Life Assistance Program on pages 6 and 7. Under this program, eligible employees receive short-term disability benefits in case of illness or injury. The benefit amount is 60% of weekly earnings, with a maximum weekly benefit of $1,500 for up to 26 weeks. It's essential to review the full certificate of coverage for comprehensive understanding of your coverage.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, you should notify us of your claim as soon as possible and within 30 days after your disability starts. Proof of your claim must be sent no later than 90 days post-elimination period; if not possible within 90 days, it must be provided no later than a year from the proof's usual requirement date (except in cases of legal incapacity). The claim form can be obtained from your employer or requested directly from us. If you don't receive the form within 15 days of requesting, submit written proof without delay. Inform us immediately if you return to work in any capacity.
<EOS>
To file a claim under the policy outlined in Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, both you and your employer are required to fill out respective sections of the claim form. Upon completion, the filled form should be provided to your attending physician who will then proceed to complete their section and send it directly to Unum without delay for processing.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, your disability claim requires evidence of regular physician care, monthly income documentation, the onset date and cause of disability, descriptions of disability restrictions and limitations affecting your occupation, plus hospital or institution treatment details, including attending physicians. You may be requested to provide proof of ongoing disability within 45 days following a request. Additional medical and non-medical information might be required for claim verification, with Unum potentially denying or suspending payments if vital information is absent.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 7 and 8, row numbers 1 and 2, the insurer will make LTD (Long Term Disability) payments directly to you under policy LTD-CLM-2 (8/1/2004 REV). These payments are subject to the policy's terms and conditions. The payments are designed to replace a percentage of your pre-disability earnings, as specified in the policy, should you become unable to work due to a covered disability.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, the policyholder is required to reimburse any overpayments resulting from fraud, errors in claim processing, or receipt of deductible income sources. Repayment methods will be determined by Unum, and they will not recover more than the amount overpaid. It is essential to note that Unum has the right to demand full repayment. This information can be found on page 8, rows [1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10].
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 9, rows 1-2, 4-6, this certificate outlines key details of your coverage, including: who is eligible for benefits, the limitations and exclusions within the plan that may apply, and the recipients to whom Unum will make payments. It's essential to understand these points, as they impact your entitlement to the specified coverage outlined in this document.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, eligibility for coverage is contingent upon employment within an eligible group. The effective date of your coverage is either the plan's initiation date or the day after completion of the waiting period.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, coverage begins as follows: If your employer fully covers the policy under a plan, you're covered from 12:01 a.m. on the date of eligibility. If costs are shared or self-paid, coverage commences at 12:01 a.m. either on the eligibility date if applied for by that time, within 31 days after eligibility, or when Unum approves your application (if evidence of insurability is required due to late application or voluntary cancellation). Evidence of insurability can be obtained from your employer. If applying beyond 31 days or reapplying after canceling, evidence of insurability is mandated.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 9, rows 1 and 2, your coverage will commence upon your return to active employment following an absence due to injury, sickness, temporary layoff, or leave of absence. This policy does not provide coverage during the time you are absent from work.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, if your employment temporarily ceases (layoff), coverage under the policy will continue until the end of the month succeeding the one in which your layoff begins, provided that premium payments are maintained. This applies only during the temporary layoff phase and does not extend to subsequent periods of unemployment or absence from work. The specific dates relevant to this coverage depend on when your employment termination occurs.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on page 10, row numbers 1-3, if an employee goes on leave of absence and premiums are paid, the coverage will continue through the month directly following the one in which their leave commences.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, any additional or increased coverage commences immediately for those in active employment or on a covered leave or layoff. If you're absent due to injury or illness, the enhanced coverage starts upon your return to work. Decreased coverage takes effect immediately as well but won't affect claims already being paid. However, changes in coverage do not impact payable claims that occurred before the decrease.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, your policy or plan coverage ends on the earliest of:

1. The date of cancellation.
2. If you are no longer part of an eligible group.
3. If your eligible group is terminated from coverage.
4. The last day of the period for which required contributions were made.
5. The last day of active employment, unless specified under the covered layoff or leave of absence provision.

Additionally, Unum provides coverage for a payable claim during the policy or plan coverage period.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, legal action on your claim can be initiated between 60 days following the submission of proof of claim and up to 3 years from when the proof of claim is required (unless otherwise stipulated under federal law). This timeframe applies to this specific policy.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, any statements made in a signed application for coverage are considered representations, not warranties. Incomplete or untrue statements can lead to claim reductions, denials, or policy cancellations from the original effective date. The insurance company will base its decisions on the statements provided in the signed application. If the employer provides incorrect information about you, they will use these facts to decide your coverage and make a fair premium adjustment.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, insurance fraud is prohibited as it may incur unnecessary costs for you and your employer. The policy vows to employ all necessary means for detecting, investigating, and prosecuting such acts. Knowingly providing false, incomplete, or misleading information to Unum, or submitting materially false claims, is considered a crime and will result in claim denial, and could lead to legal prosecution and punishment under state and/or federal law. If insurance fraud occurs, Unum will pursue appropriate legal remedies.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, this policy does not supersede any obligations for workers' compensation or state disability insurance coverage. In other words, the policy does not replace these mandatory coverages.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, your employer acts on its behalf or as your agent under this policy. Your employer will never be considered an agent of Unum. This clarification was updated in LTD-BEN-1 on August 1st, 2004 (Revision 10).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, disability is defined as a condition where an individual cannot perform the material and substantial duties of their regular occupation due to sickness or injury, and there is a minimum 20% loss in indexed monthly earnings because of the same health issue. To be considered disabled, one must be under the regular care of a physician. Unum reserves the right to have you examined by chosen physicians, medical practitioners, and vocational experts at their expense. These examinations may occur as often as necessary, and interviews with authorized Unum representatives are also possible. The loss of a professional or occupational license or certification does not automatically mean disability under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on page 17 rows [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28], benefits under items 1, 2, and 3 in the deductible sources of income section may be reduced if they have not been awarded, denied, or are being appealed. However, no reduction will occur if you apply for these disability payments, appeal your denial to all administrative levels Unum deems necessary, and sign their payment option form. Overpayments due to an award will be adjusted upon receiving proof of the amount or when all required appeals are completed. If a lump sum is received from any deductible sources, it will be distributed monthly over a specified or reasonable time period.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, if you are disabled and working concurrently, the days you are incapacitated will be factored into your elimination period for Long-Term Disability benefits (LTD-BEN). This means that your disability days are considered while determining whether you can meet the elimination period stipulation, as per the update on August 1, 2004 (revision 11).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf (page 13, rows 1-3), payments will commence once your claim is approved, contingent on the elimination period being fulfilled and if you are deemed disabled. You will receive a monthly payment for any duration that Unum is financially responsible. The elimination period could vary depending on the specific policy details, such as the option selected between short-term (14 or 26 weeks) or long-term (52 weeks).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483, page 13 row 1, the payment amount for disability is determined through a process that considers your Pre-Disability Earnings (PDE). Your PDE is typically the average of the total earnings from all covered employment in the base period. The base period is the first 52 weeks prior to the start of your Disability Benefit Period (DBP) or the actual employment during such period, whichever is longer. The benefit percentage is generally 60% of your PDE up to a maximum monthly amount, subject to cost-of-living adjustments. Your DBP may last up to 24 months initially, with extensions up to 5 years if you remain totally disabled after the initial period.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, the lesser of the two amounts determined in Item 1 (your Monthly Earnings) and the maximum monthly benefit is your gross disability payment. The maximum monthly benefit varies based on your occupation and earnings at time of policy issue. The specified waiting period for disability benefits is 180 days. Additionally, the policy provides a Residual Disability Benefit that pays a percentage of your pre-disability earnings if you return to work but earn less due to your disability. The Residual Benefit amount is determined by comparing your post-disability earnings with your pre-disability earnings.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, on page 13 row 9, your monthly disability payment (Item 4) is the amount determined under this policy. It's essential to note that any deductible sources of income should be subtracted from this payment. The specific deductible sources are not explicitly stated in this document, but they likely include income received from other sources during the period of disability, as per common practices in such policies. Consult with your policy or contact Unum for further clarification if necessary.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf (page 13, rows 1-5), the total benefit payable monthly under this policy, inclusive of all benefits, will not surpass 100% of your earnings. However, if you're enrolled in Unum's Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program, the monthly benefit can extend up to 110% of your earnings. These percentages apply to your regular salary.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 13, rows 1-6, the term "Monthly Earnings" refers to your pre-tax gross income from your employer prior to disability. This total includes all income but excludes commissions, bonuses, overtime pay, and any other additional compensation, as well as income sourced outside of your employer. Deductions made for qualified deferred compensation plans, Section 125 plans, or flexible spending accounts are also not included in this calculation.
<EOS>
During a covered layoff or leave of absence as detailed in Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 13 rows 1-3, if you become disabled, your monthly earnings from the employer effective just prior to the start of your absence will be used for disability benefits determination. The policy employs these earnings to ascertain your pre-disability income level, which determines the amount of benefits provided during your disability period. This approach ensures continuity of benefits in circumstances where an individual's earning potential has been impacted due to a covered layoff or leave of absence.
<EOS>
This information from Unum Cert 4507483.pdf outlines disability benefit payments when monthly earnings are less than 20% of indexed earnings due to a sickness or injury, with payments sent regardless of work status. If disability earnings range from 20% to 80% of indexed earnings, the payment is calculated based on LTD-BEN-3 (8/1/2004) REV 12, and during the first 12 months of payments while working, no reduction occurs as long as disability earnings plus gross disability payment do not surpass 100% of indexed monthly earnings. This structure remains in effect for the same sickness or injury.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, if the answer from Item 1 does not exceed or equal 100% of your indexed monthly earnings, your monthly payment will remain unchanged. However, if it surpasses this threshold, a deduction will be made for the amount over 100%. After 12 months of payments while working, you will start receiving payments proportionate to the disability-induced income loss percentage.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf (page 14, row 19), your monthly benefits under this policy are calculated by dividing the percentage of lost earnings specified in Item 1 by your indexed monthly earnings. This percentage represents a portion of your pre-disability income. The benefits are payable during the benefit period stated in your certificate, which may extend up to age 65 or 67 depending on the specifics of your case.
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 4507483 policy detail outlines the monthly payment amount you'll receive upon disability. You may need to provide quarterly proof of your disability earnings, and Unum reserves the right to adjust your payment accordingly. Relevant financial records could be requested for verification. After the elimination period, if disabled for less than a month, expect a 1/30th fraction of your monthly payment per day.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 14, rows 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10, if your disability earnings fluctuate significantly from month to month, the company may average your earnings over the past three months to decide whether your claim should continue. Your claim will not be terminated unless the averaged disability earnings from the last three months exceeds 80% of indexed monthly earnings. During any month that your disability earnings are more than 80% of indexed monthly earnings, Unum will not pay you benefits.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 14 and 15, row numbers 1, 2, 2, and 3, Unum will reduce your gross disability payment by deducting income from the LTD-BEN-4 policy (effective since August 1, 2004, revision 13). This means that any income earned under this specific policy will be subtracted from your total disability benefit.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 15, rows 3-5, the benefits you may receive from this policy are based on a workers' compensation law, an occupational disease law, or any other act/law with similar intent. The amount you receive is determined by these laws' provisions, which can include total or partial disability payments and death benefits. The duration of these benefits varies according to the specific law in question. Any adjustments to your benefit amount are subject to cost-of-living increases unless otherwise specified. Additionally, any back pay owed will be paid within 30 days of the date of determination, while future benefits will commence as soon as they become payable under the law.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 15, rows 8-13, the disability income you receive or are eligible for excludes benefits from state compulsory acts or laws, automobile liability insurance policies, other group insurance plans, and governmental retirement systems related to your employment. Specifically, it means that any income derived from these sources will not affect your disability payments under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, disability payments you, your spouse, or children might receive could stem from multiple sources. These include the United States Social Security Act, Canada Pension Plan, Quebec Pension Plan, and any similar plans or acts. It is crucial to note that these benefits may impact the amount of disability payments you are eligible for under this policy. The specific amount depends on various factors including your earnings before disability, the duration of disability, and the applicable plan's benefit structure.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 15 and specific rows 24-30, your retirement payments may affect the benefits received by your dependents, such as children or a spouse, if you receive them under:

* The United States Social Security Act
* The Canada Pension Plan
* The Quebec Pension Plan
* Any similar plan or act.

This applies to any dependent who is receiving payments from these plans due to your retirement benefits. It's essential to understand that these dependents' payments could be impacted if you are receiving such retirement benefits yourself.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, disability payments under your employer's retirement plan are considered either due to disability or upon reaching age 62 or the defined normal retirement age. These payments are based on your employer's contributions and do not affect the retirement benefit that would have been paid in the absence of disability. Any reduction in future disability benefits under the plan is also regarded as a retirement benefit. Unum will consider both your and your employer's contributions to be distributed concurrently throughout your lifetime. Retirement funds not rolled over or transferred to an eligible retirement plan, as defined by Section 402 of the Internal Revenue Code including any future LTD-BEN-5 amendments, are not included.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, under Section 6, benefits received are subject to the Jones Act (Title 46, United States Code Section 688). This means that the total amount you receive is reduced by a certain percentage that corresponds to your earnings before disability. The reduction begins on the first day of the disability and continues throughout its duration. The specific percentage depends on your pre-disability earnings, which should be reported accurately for proper calculation of benefits.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, your payment will be adjusted if you receive funds from a third party (judgment, settlement) due to the same disability. However, we will exclude retirement payments from reduction. The exception is made for Social Security retirement income if your disability starts after age 65 and you were already receiving such payments prior to disability. In all cases, only deductible sources of income arising from the same disability will be considered for reductions.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on page 16, several income sources are exempted from deductions when calculating gross disability payments. These include retirement plans such as 401(k), profit sharing, thrift, tax-sheltered annuities, stock ownership, non-qualified deferred compensation, pension plans for partners, military pensions and disability income, credit disability insurance, franchise disability income, retirement plans from another Employer, individual retirement accounts (IRA), individual disability income plans, salary continuation or accumulated sick leave plans.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4507483.pdf (page 16), the minimum monthly payment under the Minimum Benefit is either $100 or 10% of your gross disability payment. If there's an outstanding overpayment, Unum may apply this amount towards it.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 16 and 17, any deductible income sources that are subtracted from your long-term disability (LTD) payment will not further be reduced due to a cost of living increase from that source as per LTD-BEN-6 revised in 2004. The document emphasizes that once the reduction is made, the LTD payment will not be further decreased despite any subsequent cost of living adjustments stemming from that deductible income source.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 17 and 18, your Long-Term Disability (LTD) benefits payment duration depends on your age at disability. For instance, if you are under 62 years old, payments will continue until you reach 67. If you're 62, you'll receive payments for 60 months; if 63, 48 months; 64, 42 months; 65, 36 months; 66, 30 months; 67, 24 months; 68, 18 months; and over 69, payments last 12 months. If you are exactly 62 at the onset of disability, benefits will end 2 years and 6 months later. LTD-BEN-7 (8/1/2004) REV 16 governs these terms.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, payments will cease and your claim will end on the earliest of the following scenarios: if you are capable of working part-time in your regular occupation but decide not to, or if your monthly disability earnings exceed 80% of your indexed monthly earnings. This may also occur after the maximum payment period, if you no longer meet the plan's disability criteria (unless eligible for Unum's Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program), if you fail to cooperate or participate in this program, if you fail to submit proof of continuing disability, or if you reside outside the United States or Canada for 6 months or more during any consecutive 12 months of benefits. The payments will also stop upon your death.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, disabilities caused by self-reported symptoms or mental illness have a maximum payout period of up to 12 months. Payments may continue beyond this limit if the claimant meets one or both of these criteria:

1. The disability is expected to last for more than 12 months, or until the date of death.
2. The claimant is undergoing active treatment that can reasonably be expected to lead to an improvement in their condition.

In cases where the conditions are met, payments will continue according to Unum's policy guidelines.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, during your confinement after the initial 12-month period, payments will continue. If you remain disabled upon discharge, further payments are sent for a recovery period of up to 90 days. If reconfined within this recovery period and remain hospitalized for at least 14 consecutive days, payments will be made during the additional confinement and an additional recovery period of up to 90 more days follows. This structure applies indefinitely as long as these criteria are met.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, if you continue to be disabled after receiving payments for a year and subsequently require hospitalization for at least 14 consecutive days, benefits will be extended during your stay. However, these payments will cease upon expiration of the limited pay period or maximum payment duration, whichever comes first. This policy does not apply the mental illness limitation to dementia caused by stroke, trauma, viral infection, Alzheimer's disease, or other conditions not typically treated by a mental health provider. This policy update was made on August 1st, 2004 (LTD-BEN-8).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, the following disabilities are not covered under your policy: self-inflicted injuries, active participation in a riot, loss of a professional or occupational license, criminal convictions as per state or federal law, and pre-existing conditions. The policy does not cover disabilities due to war, acts of war, or any period during which you are incarcerated.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, a pre-existing condition is identified when, within the three months prior to your coverage's effective date, you sought medical treatment, consultations, care or services (including diagnostic measures), took prescribed drugs or medicines, or had symptoms requiring healthcare consultation that an ordinarily prudent person would have addressed. If your disability commences within the first 12 months following your effective date of coverage, it may be considered as a pre-existing condition.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, if your disability recurs within 6 months after the end of a prior claim and you were continuously insured under the plan during that interval, the recurrent disability will be considered an extension of the prior claim without requiring another elimination period. The terms of this policy will apply to both instances. However, any disability occurring more than 6 months following the end of the prior claim will be treated as a new claim, subject to all policy provisions. Additionally, if you are entitled to payments from any other group long term disability plan, you will not receive benefits under the Unum plan (LTD-OTR-1, 8/1/2004 REV 18).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, if your disability persists for at least 180 days and you're entitled to monthly payments under the plan, your survivor will receive a lump sum equal to 3 months of your gross disability payment upon your death. If no survivors exist, the payment goes to your estate (unless none). Overpayments may be deducted first.

If terminally ill with a life expectancy under 12 months, you can opt for a lump sum equivalent to 3 months of your gross disability payment. To access this option, you must provide written notice and have a physician certify your terminal illness and reduced life expectancy in writing. This benefit is available only once and if taken before death, no 3-month survivor benefit will be payable afterwards.
<EOS>
This information from Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 20 and 21 outlines their Vocational Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program. Eligibility for this program is at Unum's discretion, but you must be medically able to return to work. Your file will be reviewed by a rehabilitation professional to determine if a program might aid in returning to employment. If deemed eligible, participation is required for disability benefits and Unum will provide a tailored plan. This program may offer services like job placement, vocational evaluation, and education/retraining expenses for a new occupation, all at their discretion. You must comply with the terms of the provided plan to continue receiving disability benefits. The LTD-OTR-2 policy was revised on 8/1/2004.
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 4507483 policy provision on Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance offers an additional 10% disability benefit up to $1,000 monthly, not affected by Deductible Sources of Income. However, the Total Benefit Cap will apply. For three months post-disability cessation, if deemed non-disabled while in the Rehabilitation program and unable to find work, you'll receive a monthly benefit payment, which can be paid as a lump sum. This extra benefit is not subject to policy provisions that could increase or decrease the amount otherwise.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, payments for Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance benefits will cease upon the earliest of two dates: firstly, when Unum determines that you are no longer eligible for their Rehabilitation and Return to Work program; secondly, on any date determined by this plan where monthly payments would otherwise stop. This policy was revised in 2004 (LTD-OTR-3).
<EOS>
Under Unum's Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program outlined in document Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, during your disability, you may receive a $350 per month Dependent Care Expense Benefit for each dependent, up to a maximum of $1,000 monthly, if you are incurring expenses for the care of children under 15 or those aged 15 and above, or family members requiring personal assistance. These benefits commence upon entering the program. To qualify, you must submit satisfactory proof. The Dependent Care Expense Benefit will cease on the earliest date: a) when you no longer incur expenses for your dependents; b) when you stop participating in Unum's Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program; or c) any other date as stipulated by this plan.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, effective August 1st, 2004 (REV), under SERVICES-1, if a claimant's disability persists beyond the elimination period, Unum will provide monthly benefits up to 60% of pre-disability earnings. The maximum benefit amount is $5,000 per month. These payments are taxable as ordinary income for federal and state purposes. The policy also states that Unum reserves the right to review the claimant's case periodically to determine continued eligibility. Moreover, Unum may request documentation from the claimant or their healthcare providers throughout the duration of the disability.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf on pages 23, rows 3 and 4, additional services are accessible under your Long Term Disability plan. These services include vocational rehabilitation (VR) and educational assistance if deemed necessary by Unum. The VR program aims to help you return to work, while the educational assistance focuses on supporting further education or training for alternative employment. However, these services are only available when you've been disabled for at least 24 months, and their provision is subject to certain eligibility criteria. The cost of these services will be covered by Unum up to a maximum amount, with specific percentages depending on the service provided.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4507483.pdf, a work life assistance program is included in your plan, offering help with daily personal and professional issues. You can reach the service via a 1-800 number or online portal, accessible 24/7. The program assists with diverse concerns like arranging daycare, transportation for elderly relatives, college research for children, and coping with workplace stress. This assistance encompasses everyday matters as well as crisis support. Employers can also access this service. You can gather more details about this program through your plan administrator.
<EOS>

According to Unum Policy 4739187, coverage for absence due to injury, sickness, temporary layoff, or leave of absence begins upon your return to active employment. This means that your policy takes effect from the date you resume your job following any such event.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf on pages 17 and relevant rows [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7], if you are placed on a temporary layoff or leave of absence, premium payment guarantees coverage continuation. Specifically, during a temporary layoff, your policy will remain active until the end of the month that follows the initial month of your layoff. Similarly, while on a leave of absence, coverage extends until the end of the subsequent month to the one in which you began your leave. These provisions apply only when premiums are duly paid.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187, any additional or increased coverage commences immediately if you're actively employed, on a covered layoff, or leave of absence. Conversely, if your employment status is due to illness or injury, the additional coverage kicks in upon returning to active work. However, any reduction in coverage takes effect promptly and won't impact a claim paid prior to the decrease.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187, your coverage ends on the earliest of the following events: the policy or plan being cancelled; you no longer belonging to an eligible group; your eligible group is terminated; you stop making required contributions during the coverage period; or the end of active employment, unless under a covered layoff or leave of absence provision.

Under Unum Policy 4739187, any statements you or your employer make in a signed application for coverage are considered representations, not warranties. If these statements are found to be incomplete or untrue at the time they're made, Unum may either reduce or deny any subsequent claims, or cancel your coverage from its original effective date. This policy is detailed on page 17, rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 of the document.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, statements made in a signed application serve as the basis for coverage determination.

If an employer provides incorrect information about you, the policy allows adjustments to premiums and coverage decisions based on accurate facts. This process ensures fairness in maintaining your insurance plan.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187, insurance fraud is strictly prohibited. Knowingly and intentionally providing false, incomplete, or misleading information to Unum for any claim purposes is considered a crime, subject to prosecution and punishment under both state and federal law.

Any actions containing materially false information may lead to claim denial. Unum will pursue all available legal remedies in case of fraud.

According to Unum Policy 4739187 on page [27], you are deemed disabled when the insurer determines that you cannot perform the significant duties of your regular occupation due to illness or injury, and have lost at least 20% in indexed monthly earnings from the same cause. After 24 months of payments, disability is defined as an inability to work any gainful occupation for which you are qualified by education, training, or experience. You must be under a physician's care to be considered disabled. A loss of professional or occupational license does not equate to disability. Unum may request examinations from their chosen physicians, medical practitioners, and vocational experts, covering costs. They can require examinations as needed and interviews with authorized Unum representatives.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, if you potentially qualify for benefits under items 1, 2, and 3 in the deductible sources of income section, we'll estimate your entitlement. Your Long Term Disability payment may be reduced by these estimated amounts if the benefits: a) haven't been awarded; b) haven't been denied; or c) have been denied but are being appealed. However, reduction will not occur if you apply for and appeal denials at all administrative levels Unum deems necessary, sign their payment option form, and promise to repay any overpayment caused by an award.

Your payment will be adjusted upon receipt of proof of the awarded amount or completion of all necessary appeals. If an adjustment reduces your payment, a lump sum refund of the estimated amount will follow. Lump sum payments from deductible sources are pro-rated monthly over the specified time period, with a reasonable one applied when no time is stated.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4739187, if you are disabled while working, the days you are unable to perform your regular work duties will contribute towards fulfilling your elimination period. This means that should you become disabled and continue working, your disability period would still count towards meeting the time requirement necessary before disability benefits can be activated. The elimination period, as defined in this policy, is generally 7 days for an Own Occupation benefit or 14 days for Any Occupation benefit. However, if you are receiving partial disability benefits during this period, the elimination period will end.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187, payments will commence upon approval of a validated claim, post the elimination period and if you're deemed disabled. The policy provides monthly payments for any eligible duration. This policy was updated on February 1st, 2008. To receive these benefits, both the elimination period must elapse and your disability status needs to be confirmed.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4739187, your disability benefits will be determined through a process that considers your monthly earnings prior to the disability and your total disability benefit amount. The policy pays a percentage of your pre-disability earnings; the exact percentage depends on your occupation. If you're engaged in sedentary work, 50% of your earnings are covered; for light work, 70%; for medium work, 80%; and for heavy or very heavy work, 90%. The total disability benefit amount cannot exceed $10,000 per month. These calculations are subject to a maximum of 60 times the basic monthly benefit. Any disability that lasts beyond 24 months will be evaluated annually, and payments may be adjusted based on your ability to perform work or changes in your earnings.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4739187, your weekly disability payment is determined by comparing two amounts: the maximum weekly benefit and the answer derived from item 1 (gross income). The lesser of these two figures will serve as your gross disability payment. This calculation is outlined on page 20, row 4 of the policy document.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 4739187.pdf (page 28, row 9), your monthly disability payment (Item 4) is calculated. However, this amount will be reduced by any deductible sources of income you may have. It's crucial to note that these reductions are applied to ensure you receive the difference between your disability payment and your earned income. This policy applies throughout the duration of your disability benefit period.
<EOS>
In Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, the "Monthly Earnings" are crucial for determining disability benefits. For partners, this figure is their average monthly income from the year before disability, based on either the "net earnings (loss) from self-employment" line of the Schedule K-1 or the actual employment period if not a partner during that year. Exclusively from the Employer are these earnings considered. For employees, it's their average gross monthly income from the calendar year preceding disability, as indicated on the W-2 form or during the employment tenure if no W-2 was issued prior to disability. Gross income before taxes is what this average represents, excluding pre-tax contributions and certain allowances. Excluded are also non-Employer sources of income. This policy was updated on 2/1/2008 (LTD-BEN-3).
<EOS>
During a covered layoff or leave of absence as per Unum Policy 4739187, if you become disabled, the monthly earnings from your employer prior to the start of your absence will be used to calculate disability benefits. This means that your current salary just before your absence begins serves as the basis for determining your benefit amount.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, if you become disabled due to the same sickness or injury, and your monthly disability earnings are less than 20% of your indexed monthly earnings, Unum will send a monthly payment. If your monthly disability earnings range from 20% to 80%, Unum calculates the payment such that for the first 12 months while you're working, the monthly payment remains unchanged as long as the sum of your disability earnings and the gross disability payment does not exceed 100% of your indexed monthly earnings.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 4739187.pdf at page 21, row 8, your weekly lost earnings will be calculated and divided by your overall weekly earnings to determine the percentage of your wages you'll receive as benefits under this policy. This percentage will serve as the basis for the payment amount, ensuring fair compensation during your period of disability. The specific duration of these payments is contingent on the terms of your individual policy, including any qualifying conditions and maximum benefit periods stated therein.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, the weekly payment you receive is multiplied by the value in Item 2 (page 21, rows 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18). Unum reserves the right to demand proof of your disability earnings each week, adjusting your payment accordingly. As part of this verification process, you may be required to submit appropriate financial records, deemed necessary for substantiating your income by Unum.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4739187, if your disability earnings fluctuate significantly month-to-month, the policy averages your earnings over the previous 3 months to decide whether your claim should continue. Your claim will not be terminated unless the average of your disability earnings from these three months exceeds 80% of indexed monthly earnings. During any month when your disability earnings exceed 80% of indexed monthly earnings, you will not receive payment under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf on pages 30, rows 1 & 2, your disability payment will be reduced by certain deductible income sources. These include any wages you earn from working for another employer, any worker's compensation benefits, and any disability insurance payments from other policies that are payable for the same period of disability as this policy. Additionally, if you're a public safety officer, military reserve or National Guard member, or government employee under certain retirement systems, your pension contributions may also be considered deductible income. The specific reduction amount will be 85% of these earnings unless otherwise specified in your policy. Exclusions and limitations apply; consult your policy for details.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187, disability income payments may not be received concurrently with state compulsory benefit act or law benefits or any other group insurance plan. The policy specifies that the total amount of such combined benefits cannot exceed 85% of pre-disability earnings. Any discrepancies in this limit will result in a reduction from one of the benefits. This provision is effective on the start date of your disability income benefit and continues throughout the duration of your claim unless otherwise noted.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, your benefits may originate from three primary sources: under the mandatory portion of any "no fault" motor vehicle plan; under Title 46, United States Code Section 688 (The Jones Act); or from a third party following settlement or judgment, after deducting attorney's fees. The amount you receive could vary depending on these sources and may be subject to certain conditions. Benefits derived from the "no fault" motor vehicle plan will adhere to specific rules outlined in the policy, while benefits under The Jones Act might have unique eligibility criteria defined by Section 688 of Title 46. Any third-party compensation received after attorney's fees are deducted may impact your overall benefit amount.
<EOS>
This information from Unum Policy 4739187.pdf on pages [21, 22] outlines disability and retirement benefits derived from your employer's STD-BEN-4 (2/1/2008) retirement plan. Disability payments are benefits paid due to disability that do not decrease the retirement benefit if they occur. Retirement benefits stem from your employer's contributions to the plan.

Disability benefits that reduce retirement benefits are also considered as retirement benefits. Simultaneous distribution of retirement funds from the plan throughout your lifetime is assumed by Unum. Rolled-over or transferred amounts are not included.

The Internal Revenue Code Section 402 definition for an eligible retirement plan applies, including future amendments. Deductible sources of income resulting from the same disability are the only ones deducted.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, several income sources will not be deducted from your disability payment. These include but are not limited to: 401(k), profit sharing, thrift plans, tax-sheltered annuities, stock ownership plans, non-qualified deferred compensation plans, pension plans for partners, military pensions and disability income, credit disability insurance, franchise disability income, retirement plans from other employers, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), individual disability income plans, no-fault motor vehicle plans, salary continuation or accumulated sick leave plans. These sources of income are not considered when calculating your disability payment.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, the minimum monthly payment under the LTD benefit is either $100 or 10% of your gross disability payment. Whichever figure is greater will apply. Notably, Unum may utilize this amount towards settling any outstanding overpayments. This regulation is outlined on pages [31, 32] in rows [1, 2, 2, 3, 5].
<EOS>
This information from Unum Policy 4739187.pdf on pages [32, 33] outlines the maximum period of disability payments. The duration depends on your age at disability: less than 62 years old follows Social Security Normal Retirement Age; 62 years receives 60 months (LTD-BEN-7); 63 and 64 receive 48 and 42 months respectively; 65, 36 months; 66, 30 months; 67, 24 months; 68, 18 months; and 69 or older, 12 months. Age of Social Security Normal Retirement for various years ranges from 65 to 67 depending on birth year (e.g., born before 1937, 65 years; born in 1955, 66 years 2 months). The policy also states that the maximum payment period is based on your disability age and not the Social Security retirement age.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, payments will cease under the following circumstances:

- Within the first 24 months, if you can work part-time in your regular occupation but opt not to;
- After 24 months, if you can engage in any part-time gainful occupation but choose not to;
- If your disability earnings exceed 80% of indexed monthly earnings, from the date they surpass 80%;
- At the end of the maximum payment period;
- If you are no longer disabled according to plan terms (unless eligible for Unum's Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program);
- If you fail to submit proof of continuing disability;
- After 12 months of payments if residing outside the United States or Canada, defined as spending more than half of any 12 consecutive months abroad;
- Upon your death.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, the following disabilities are not covered: self-inflicted injuries, participation in a riot, loss of professional or occupational license/certification due to criminal conviction, pre-existing conditions, or any disability resulting from war, declared or undeclared. The plan does not provide coverage during incarceration periods. This information can be found on pages 34 and 35, rows [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 2].
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf (page 24, rows 2, 4-10), if your current disability is related to the same cause(s) as a prior claim for which Unum made a payment, you will not need to complete another elimination period while working full time for 14 consecutive days or less. However, should you return to work on the 15th day, your current disability would be treated as a new claim subject to all provisions and requiring a new elimination period.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, if your current disability is unrelated to your prior claim, you will not need to complete another elimination period when working full-time for less than a day. However, your new disability will be subject to the same terms as your previous one unless you don't meet conditions 1 or 2 specified above, in which case it becomes a new claim and all policy provisions apply. If eligible for payments under another group short-term disability plan, you are ineligible for Unum benefits (STD-OTR-1 from 2/1/2008).
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, the program offered helps individuals return to work by providing vocational rehabilitation and assistance. Eligibility is determined by Unum at their discretion, requiring medical ability for return-to-work programs. A review of your claim file will analyze both medical and vocational information to determine an appropriate return-to-work program.

The program may include various services such as coordinating with employers, providing adaptive equipment or job accommodations, vocational evaluations, job placement, resume preparation, job skills training, and education/retraining expenses for a new occupation. Unum makes the final decision on your participation and will provide a written rehabilitation plan tailored to your needs.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4739187, a supplementary disability benefit of 10% up to $1,000 per month is provided, exempt from policy provisions increasing or decreasing the amount, except for the Total Benefit Cap. This extra payment is given for three months after your disability ends, if you're participating in their Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program and are unable to find employment. The benefit may be paid in a lump sum. This arrangement is subject to termination if you find employment during the benefit period.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4739187, the Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program benefits will terminate on the earliest of these dates:

1. When Unum determines your ineligibility for continued participation in this program.
2. If monthly payments would cease according to the plan at any other specified date.

These benefits are governed by LTD-OTR-3 (issued 2/1/2008).
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187, page 28 row 6, your monthly disability payment will be determined by comparing the answer from Item 1 (your pre-disability earnings) with the maximum monthly benefit. The lesser of these two amounts is what you will receive as your gross disability payment. It's essential to note that this policy applies only if your disability prevents you from performing the material duties of any occupation for which you are reasonably suited by education, training, or experience. This payment is subject to applicable taxes and begins upon the date specified in the policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187, the total monthly benefit provided under this plan will not surpass 100% of your earnings. Participation in Unum's Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program allows for a slightly higher benefit, up to 110% of your monthly earnings. This information can be found on page 28, rows 1-5 of the policy document.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, if the result from Item 1 is equal to or less than 100% of your indexed monthly earnings, no further reductions will be made to your monthly payment. Conversely, if it exceeds 100%, Unum will deduct the excess from your monthly payment. After 12 months of payments while working, you'll receive subsequent payments based on the percentage of income loss due to disability.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4739187, the percentage of lost earnings is determined by dividing your disability benefit by your indexed monthly earnings at the time the claim was filed. This policy offers a replacement of up to 60% of your pre-disability earnings during the initial period of disability and up to 55% during the extended period of disability. The benefits will continue until you return to work or reach age 65, provided the disability continues.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187, the monthly payment amount you receive is determined by multiplying the figure stated in Item 2. Unum may request proof of your disability earnings at least every quarter, and they will adjust your payment based on these earnings. Appropriate financial records may be required for this purpose. After the elimination period, if your disability lasts less than a month, you'll receive 1/30 of your monthly payment for each day of disability. This policy was updated on 2/1/2008.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf on pages 30 rows 6, 7, and 8, the benefits you receive are contingent upon three key factors: a workers' compensation law, an occupational disease law, or any other legislation with similar intent. Eligibility is determined by the presence of these laws in the state where the disability occurred. The policy will pay up to 24 months of your monthly salary, subject to specific maximum and minimum limits. Any benefits from these sources must be reported to Unum, as they may impact the amount you receive under this policy. Additionally, any changes to these sources during the benefit period should also be communicated promptly.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187, page 30 rows 11-15, the disability income you receive is not affected by state compulsory benefit acts or laws, other group insurance plans, or governmental retirement systems related to your employer. This applies only if these benefits are received independently of your disability income from Unum. Additionally, should you receive a lump sum payment from a third-party settlement for workers' compensation claims, such funds may be offset against your disability benefit payments under certain conditions. The offset percentage depends on the nature and timing of the settlement.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, under the disability benefits section on pages 30 row numbers 18, 20, 21, 22, and 23, if you become disabled, your disability payments may be reduced by any disability income received from other sources, such as the United States Social Security Act, Canada Pension Plan, Quebec Pension Plan, or any similar plan or act. The reduction is proportional to the amount you receive or are entitled to from these sources, and it does not affect retirement benefits. This provision applies equally to you, your spouse, and your children. The exact reduction percentage varies based on your specific circumstances, as detailed in the policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, if you receive retirement payments from the United States Social Security Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the Quebec Pension Plan, or any comparable plan or legislation, your retirement benefits will be reduced proportionately. The reduction percentage is based on the amount of your spouse's or children's retirement payments received. For instance, if 50% of your benefit goes to your spouse or child, your retirement payment from this policy will be reduced by 50%. This reduction applies only when you and your dependent(s) are all receiving retirement payments simultaneously. The effective date for these reductions is the later of the dates on which both your retirement payments and their payments begin.
<EOS>
This information from Unum Policy 4739187.pdf (pages 30-31, rows 36 to 18) details the nature of disability and retirement payments under an employer's retirement plan. Disability payments are those benefits paid due to disability that do not reduce the retirement benefit (if not for the disability). These payments are considered based on the employer's contribution to the retirement plan, with disability benefits reducing the retirement benefit also being considered as a retirement benefit.

The policy specifies that any retirement funds from the retirement plan will be distributed simultaneously throughout your lifetime, considering both yours and your employer's contributions. Retirement payments begin when you reach either age 62 or the normal LTD-BEN-5 (2/1/2008) retirement age as defined in your employer's retirement plan.

The definition of an eligible retirement plan is according to Section 402 of the Internal Revenue Code, including any future amendments that may affect the definition. Amounts received do not include amounts rolled over or transferred to any eligible retirement plan.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, for disability benefits under the Jones Act, only non-retirement income sources linked to the same disability will be deducted from your payments. Exclusions apply for Social Security retirement income if your disability onset occurs after age 65 and you were already receiving such payments prior.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf on pages 32 rows 1-3, any deductible income subtracted from your gross disability payment will not be subject to further reductions due to cost-of-living increases from that source. The policy ensures that even with such increases, your disability payment remains unaffected. It is essential to note that the initial reduction of your payment by the deductible income serves as the sole adjustment, and no further reductions will be made due to subsequent cost-of-living increases stemming from that source.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Policy 4739187, disabilities primarily based on self-reported symptoms or resulting from mental illness have a lifetime cumulative maximum benefit period of 24 months. Payments for any combination of such disabilities will not exceed this limit, regardless if they are unrelated or non-continuous. However, payments may continue beyond the 24-month period if you meet certain conditions, as specified in LTD-BEN-8 (2/1/2008). This policy is found on pages [33, 34] of the document, with relevant information in rows [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 1, 3, 4].
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, if you are confined to a hospital or institution at the end of the 24-month period, they will continue sending payments during your confinement. If you remain disabled upon discharge, they will provide additional payments for a recovery period up to 90 days. If reconfined during this recovery period for at least 14 consecutive days, they will send more payments during that extra confinement and another recovery period of up to 90 days.
<EOS>
This Unum Policy 4739187 outlines that if you receive payments after the initial 24-month period due to disability, and then are hospitalized or institutionalized for at least 14 consecutive days, subsequent payments will be made during your confinement duration. However, payments will cease either at the end of the specified limited pay period or upon reaching the maximum payment period, whichever comes first. The policy does not apply the mental illness limitation to dementia resulting from stroke, trauma, viral infection, Alzheimer's disease, or other conditions not typically treated by a mental health provider.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, a pre-existing condition is identified if medical treatment, consultation, care, services, or diagnostic measures were received, prescribed drugs or medicines were taken within the three months preceding your policy's effective date. The disability must also begin during the first 12 months after the effective date of coverage to be considered a pre-existing condition.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, if a policyholder experiences a recurrent disability within six months following the end of their prior claim and has remained continuously insured under the plan during this period, the recurrent disability will be considered an extension of the original claim. No additional elimination period is required. However, any disability occurring after six months from the end of the prior claim will be treated as a new claim, subject to all policy provisions including the elimination period. Simultaneous payments under any other group long-term disability plan make a holder ineligible for Unum payments. This information pertains to claims filed on or after February 1, 2008.

This information from Unum Policy 4739187.pdf (page numbers [36], rows [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 30, 32, 33]) outlines the Survivor Benefit provisions. If eligible and terminally ill with a life expectancy less than 12 months, you can receive a lump sum equivalent to 3 months of your gross disability payment. Eligibility is contingent on receiving a physician's written certification confirming a terminal illness and reduced life expectancy.

If you die while still disabled and meeting the plan's conditions, your survivor will receive a lump sum equal to 3 months of your gross disability payment. If no eligible survivors are found, payment goes to your estate, unless none exists. Prior to death, if diagnosed terminally ill, you may receive the benefit, but any overpayment will be applied first, and no subsequent survivor benefit is payable upon death. This benefit can only be claimed once on a voluntary basis.

According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf on pages 42 and specific rows 45, 47, and 48, Gainful Occupation refers to a job that generates an income within one year of your return to work. This income must meet certain thresholds: if you're employed, it should be at least 80% of your indexed monthly earnings; if not, it should be a minimum of 60%. These percentages are determined based on the policyholder's pre-disability earnings and are subject to indexing.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187, page 42 row 51, a grace period is granted for late premium payments. During this time, the overdue payment can be made without causing policy termination. The duration of the grace period varies based on the policy type but typically ranges from 30 to 60 days. If the payment isn't received within this period, the policy may be terminated. It is essential to note that any interest or fees due will still accrue during the grace period.

Under Unum Policy 4739187, the Gross Disability Payment refers to the total benefit amount before deductions for any income sources or disability earnings. If you are deemed disabled, your payment will be calculated based on this definition. The policy excludes certain conditions and earnings, but it's essential to note that specific details about these exclusions can be found elsewhere in the document. In calculating your Gross Disability Payment, Unum considers your pre-disability earnings up to a maximum monthly benefit of $15,000 or 66 2/3% of your pre-disability earnings, whichever is less. This payment will continue for the duration of your disability, as long as you remain disabled and meet the policy's continued participation requirements.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187, Page 43, Row 3, Hospital or Institution refers to a licensed and accredited facility that provides care for the condition leading to your disability.

According to Unum Policy 4739187, the Indexed Monthly Earnings refer to your earnings' adjustment annually by the lesser of 10% or the current annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U), published by the U.S. Department of Labor. This adjustment ensures your indexed monthly earnings can only increase or remain the same, but never decrease. Unum reserves the right to use an alternative similar measurement if the Department of Labor alters or ceases publishing the CPI-U. The indexing is applicable for determining the percentage of lost earnings while you're disabled and working, as well as the determination of gainful occupation.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf on pages 43, rows 18-19, an 'Injury' refers to a bodily harm directly caused by an accident and not linked to any other cause.

<EOS>
This policy from Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, under Other Features (page 6, row 1), outlines the Continuity of Coverage provision. If you become totally disabled before age 65 and remain continuously disabled for 24 months, your coverage will continue without interruption up to age 65, regardless of your occupation or income level. Additionally, if you return to work in a reduced capacity due to your disability, you can still maintain the same level of coverage, provided you are receiving less than your pre-disability earnings. After age 65, coverage is available under certain retiree health plans, subject to their terms and conditions.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, under the Minimum Benefit section on page 6 row 1, pre-existing conditions are subject to a 3/12 rule. This implies that if an insured individual has received treatment, taken medication, or undergone a diagnostic procedure for a medical condition within three months or twelve months before the effective date of the policy, the claim relating to that condition may be reduced or denied until the condition has been symptom-free and untreated for 12 consecutive months.
<EOS>

Proof of the claim must be provided no later than one year following the start date of disability, except in cases where failure to do so stems from a lack of legal capacity. Notification is required upon returning to work in any capacity. Note that proof of claim cannot be submitted past the statutory deadline for initiating a legal proceeding, even if the delay is due to a lack of legal capacity or state law exceptions.
<EOS>
To file a claim under Unum Cert 5019931.pdF, both you and your employer must fill out the respective sections of the claim form.

Additional information may be required such as financial records, income tax returns, and periodic claim proof. Unum reserves the right to request examinations, interviews with authorized representatives, and examinations by chosen medical practitioners or vocational experts. Failure to comply could result in denied claims or cessation of payments. Proof of claim must be submitted within 45 days of request, and Unum may require ongoing proof. LTD-CLM-2 (12/1/2015) is the relevant reference for this information.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, payments will be made directly to you. The policy provides benefits for a specific duration or until you recover, whichever is longer. Payments are based on the percentage of your pre-disability earnings, as defined in the policy. It's essential to note that these payments may be subject to taxes depending on your individual circumstances. The policy also includes certain conditions and exclusions, which should be thoroughly reviewed for a complete understanding of your benefits.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, if an overpayment occurs due to fraud, claim processing errors, disability earnings, or deductible sources of income under your claim, you are required to fully reimburse the company. The repayment method will be determined by Unum and may involve reducing or withholding future payments, including minimum monthly payments. Unum will not seek more than the amount overpaid. Any unpaid premiums for your coverage under this policy can be recovered by offsetting against future payables or through other legal means. The document also states that any remaining unpaid premiums may be recovered if necessary.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages 10, rows 1-3, this certificate of coverage provides a summary of your potential benefits. It outlines who will receive payments (beneficiary) and the scope of coverage. It also specifies any limitations, exclusions, and requirements within your plan. These details can impact the amount and type of payment you may receive. Additionally, on row 5, it mentions attachments that might further clarify certain aspects of your policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages 10, eligible group employees are covered once the later of two dates is reached: either the policy's effective date or one day following their waiting period completion. This means that an employee must be working for the employer when the plan becomes active, and after fulfilling the waiting period, coverage begins. The specific dates vary based on the plan and individual circumstances.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, your coverage begins under specific conditions: if your employer fully covers the cost of your plan, you are insured at 12:01 a.m. on the date you become eligible for coverage. If you or your employer share the cost or pay the full amount yourself, coverage starts at 12:01 a.m., either on the date of eligibility if an application is submitted beforehand, within 31 days following eligibility, or when Unum approves your application if evidence of insurability is required. Evidence of insurability is mandatory for late applicants or those reapplying after voluntarily canceling coverage. You can obtain the necessary form from your employer. Eligibility dates and application deadlines are crucial in determining your insurance commencement.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, your insurance coverage begins when you return to active employment after an absence due to injury, sickness, temporary layoff, or leave of absence. This implies that your coverage will not commence during the period of absence itself but rather upon resuming regular employment duties.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages 10, rows 1-3, if your employment is temporarily suspended (layoff), coverage under the policy persists through the month immediately following the month in which your layoff commences, given premium payments are maintained.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on page 11, during a leave of absence, if premiums are paid, the coverage will continue through the month following the one in which the leave begins. This means that your insurance protection extends up to the end of the subsequent month after your leave starts.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, any changes to your coverage take effect instantly if you're actively employed or on a covered layoff or leave of absence. If you're not working due to injury or sickness, the additional or increased coverage starts upon your return to active employment. Decreased coverage takes effect immediately and will not affect ongoing payments. Any adjustments in coverage commencement dates are based on these conditions.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, your insurance coverage terminates on the earliest of:

1. The policy or plan cancellation date.
2. Your departure from an eligible group.
3. The cessation of coverage for your eligible group.
4. The final day of any required contributions payment period.
5. The last day you are actively employed, unless stipulated under the covered layoff or leave of absence provision.

It is crucial to note that Unum will only cover payable claims during the policy/plan coverage period.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, legal action regarding your claim may commence 60 days after proof of claim is given and must be completed within 3 years from the later of when the initial proof of claim was required, your claim was denied, or benefits were terminated. This timeframe can be extended under federal law if specified.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, any statements made in a signed application for coverage are considered representations, not warranties. Incomplete or untrue statements can lead to claim reduction or denial, or coverage cancellation from the original effective date. The company will base decisions on these statements alone. If an employer provides incorrect information about you, they will use this data to decide your coverage and make a fair premium adjustment.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, effective from December 1st, 2015 (EMPLOYEE-3), the policy disables the waiver of the required disability insurance premium payment for Employee 123456 in the event of a physical or mental illness that prevents gainful employment, as long as such condition persists beyond 90 days. The disability benefit amount will be calculated based on the employee's salary and the policy provisions, with a maximum monthly payout of $3,000 and a minimum of $100. Any outstanding premium payments due prior to the qualifying disability date must be paid within 60 days from the receipt of the notice. Additionally, any changes in employment status or income must be reported promptly to Unum to ensure accurate benefit calculations. The policy also includes a provision for periodic reviews, typically every three years, to determine if the employee continues to meet the disability criteria.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages 12, rows 1-6, the insurer pledges to combat insurance fraud diligently to avoid additional costs for you and your employer. They will prioritize investigating and prosecuting any instances of fraudulent activities, which includes knowingly and intentionally providing false, incomplete, or misleading information, or submitting materially false claims. Such actions may result in the denial of your claim, and can be subject to both state and federal legal prosecution and penalties. The company is prepared to take all appropriate legal action against insurance fraud.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf (page 12, rows 1-2), the policy does not supersede or modify any obligations for workers' compensation or state disability insurance coverage requirements. In other words, your benefits under this policy will not replace potential entitlements from these programs. These requirements may vary based on jurisdiction and are subject to respective state laws.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, your employer acts as either its own agent or yours under the policy's terms. In no case will your employer be deemed as an agent of Unum. This clarification was made on December 1, 2015 (LTD-BEN-1).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf at pages 13, row 1, an individual is considered disabled if they are unable to perform the material and substantial duties of their own occupation due to a physical or mental health condition. The disability must prevent them from performing these duties on a full-time basis for a significant and continued period, typically lasting beyond the first 24 months. This definition may be subject to change as the policyholder's medical conditions improve or worsen. Additionally, Unum will consider the effects of pain, medication, and side effects of treatment when determining disability status.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages 13, row 1, 1, 1, and 2, disability benefits are provided if you experience a 20% or more decrease in indexed monthly earnings due to the same sickness or injury. After 24 months of payments, Unum determines your total and permanent disability, which means you're unable to perform any gainful occupation due to the same sickness or injury.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, a physician's regular care is necessary for disability consideration. Holding a revoked professional or occupational license or certification does not equate to being disabled.
<EOS>
This information from Unum Cert 5019931.pdf outlines the rules for Long Term Disability benefits reduction when deductible sources of income (Items 1, 2, and 3) are involved. If these benefits have not been awarded, denied, or are being appealed, a reduction in your payment may occur. However, this reduction will not apply if you: a) apply for the disability payments under said items and exhaust all necessary appeal levels; b) sign Unum's payment option form promising to repay any overpayment caused by an award.

An adjustment will be made when we receive proof of the awarded amount or confirmation that appeals have been completed and benefits denied. In such cases, a lump sum refund of the estimated amount will be given to you. If you receive a lump sum payment from these sources, it will be distributed monthly over a reasonable time period if no specific one is provided.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, if you become disabled while working, the days you are unable to work due to your disability will be counted towards satisfying your elimination period under the policy. This means that you may meet the elimination period requirement more quickly than if you were not working during your disability. It's important to note that this applies only to the period of time when you are both disabled and employed, as it is the combined days from these two periods that will count towards satisfying the elimination period. The exact number of days required for the elimination period will depend on the specific policy terms.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages 13, rows 1-3, payments for an approved claim will commence when the elimination period is met and you become disabled. Eligibility for these monthly payments continues as long as Unum is liable. The elimination period must be satisfied before payments can begin, ensuring that payments start after a specified duration, typically ranging from 30 to 180 days depending on the policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, your disability payment will be determined based on a few factors:

1. Your Monthly Basic Earnings (MBE): This is the average of your earnings before taxes for the calendar year prior to your Disability Effective Date.
2. The Maximum Benefit Percentage (MBP): For this policy, it's 60%.
3. The Maximum Monthly Benefit (MMB): To find this, multiply your MBE by the MBP. This amount cannot exceed $15,000 per month.
4. The Elimination Period (EP): This is the time between when you become disabled and when your benefits start. It's 30 days for most policies.
5. The Disability Effective Date: This is the date your disability began according to Unum's determination.
6. The End of Benefit Period: This depends on whether you have an Own Occupation or Any Occupation rider. For Own Occupation, benefits end when you no longer meet the definition of disabled in your own occupation; for Any Occupation, they end after 24 months or when you're able to work any occupation for which you're reasonably suited by education, training, or experience.
7. The Coordination of Benefits: If you have more than one policy with Unum, the total payments may be less than your combined Maximum Monthly Benefits due to this coordination rule.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, page 14 rows 1 and 2, the maximum monthly benefit for the LTD-BEN-2 policy effective from 12/1/2015 is set at $10,000. This coverage amount represents the maximum amount paid per month in case of disability and serves as the basis for calculating benefits under this policy.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on page 14, row 1, the monthly benefit you receive for a disability is either the specified maximum amount or your pre-disability earnings, whichever is lesser. In other words, your gross disability payment equals the smaller of these two amounts during the policy term.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages 14 (rows 1, 1, 1, 2, 3), your monthly disability payment (Item 4) may be reduced based on your earnings during disability. If you are disabled for less than a month, you will receive 1/30 of your monthly payment and additional benefits for each day of disability. The total amount paid daily is 1/30 of both the monthly payment and any additional benefits. This reduction in payment applies after the elimination period.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages 14, rows 1-5, the monthly total benefit you receive under this plan will not surpass 100% of your earnings, regardless of any other benefits. However, if enrolled in Unum's Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program, the monthly total benefit will not exceed 110% of your earnings.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages 14 and subsequent rows 1-6, your "Monthly Earnings" refers to your annual gross income before taxes, deductions for qualified deferred compensation plans, Section 125 plans, or flexible spending accounts. This income can be sourced from the income box of your W-2 form for the year preceding your disability date, or, if no W-2 was issued, from your employment period. The calculation does not account for income derived from car, housing, moving allowances, Employer contributions to a qualified deferred compensation plan, or external sources. It's important to note that this figure does not include tips and other non-wage compensations reported on the W-2 form.
<EOS>
During a covered layoff or leave of absence, if you become disabled, your monthly earnings used for disability benefits will be based on those provided by your employer immediately before your absence commences, as stated in Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages [14], rows [1, 2, 3]. This means that the amount of financial assistance you receive during such a period is tied to your previous employment income.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, if you become disabled and continue working reduced hours, a monthly payment will be provided, subject to the following conditions:

- Your base salary at the time of disability must be less than 80% of your predisability earnings.
- The monthly payment is determined by taking 22% of your monthly earnings above 80% of your predisability earnings and capping it at 67% of your predisability earnings.
- Any pension or retirement income you receive will be deducted from the calculated monthly payment.
- If you are over 65 years old, a maximum benefit period of 24 months applies. For those under 65, the benefit period is up to age 65 or the return to work date, whichever comes first.
- The monthly payment will be adjusted annually based on changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages 14 and 15, under the Disability Earnings section (rows 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3), if your disability arises from the same sickness or injury, and your monthly disability earnings are between 20% and 80% of your indexed monthly earnings, Unum will calculate your payment as follows: during the initial 12 months while you're working, your payment won't be reduced if the combined disability earnings and gross disability payment don't surpass 100% of your indexed monthly earnings (as per LTD-BEN-3 dated 12/1/2015).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages 15 and specific rows 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, if the response from Item 1 is equal to or less than 100% of your indexed monthly earnings, no further reduction in monthly payments will occur. However, if it surpasses 100%, Unum deducts this excess from your payment. After 12 months of making payments while working, you become eligible for receipt of payments proportionate to the percentage of income lost due to disability.
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 5019931 policy detail on page 15, row 1 outlines the percentage of lost earnings for a claimant. To calculate this, one's monthly earnings prior to disability must be divided by the indexed monthly earnings specified in the policy. The resulting figure represents the percentage of lost earnings and is an essential aspect of determining benefits under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, the monthly payment amount is key for your benefits. During disability claims process, financial records such as income tax returns might be requested to verify earnings. Post the elimination period, if disabled for less than a month, you'll receive 1/30 of the payment per day.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, if your disability earnings are irregular month-to-month, the eligibility for benefits will be assessed based on the average of your income over the past three months. This policy ensures flexibility in determining benefits during times of fluctuating earnings, promoting financial security amidst unpredictable circumstances.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, pages 15, rows 1-2, your disability payment may be reduced by certain deductible sources of income. These include:

- Any disability benefits payable under a government program (e.g., Social Security Disability Insurance or Workers' Compensation) or any other group long-term disability policy.
- Self-employment income, if you are self-employed and have elected to receive business income replacement benefits under the policy.
- Any severance pay or supplemental unemployment benefit payments received from your employer.
- Any retirement benefits you may be entitled to under any plan sponsored by your employer.
- The net after-tax value of any life insurance, annuity, or endowment contract for which you are a beneficiary and/or owner.
- Any income received from rental properties that you own personally or through a partnership, LLC, or corporation, if the property was acquired during the benefit period.

These reductions apply to your gross disability payment and are based on the actual amount you receive in each category. The specific reduction percentage varies depending on the type of income source.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages 15, rows 1-3, the benefits you receive or are eligible for may be affected by various laws, including workers' compensation and occupational disease statutes, as well as any legislation with a similar intent. These laws may limit your payments or alter their duration based on provisions within these acts. The exact impact of these laws will depend on individual circumstances, such as the nature of the disability, the timing of the occurrence in relation to your employment, and the specific regulations governing each law. The percentages and duration of benefits may vary significantly depending on the legislative context, so it's essential to review relevant details in these areas of law if you have concerns about your entitlements.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages 15 and 16, the disability income you receive or are eligible for will not be reduced by disability retirement payments under any state compulsory benefit act or law, group plans sponsored by your employer, other group insurance plans, LTD-BEN-4 (12/1/2015), or governmental retirement systems. However, it's important to note that these exemptions do not apply if the total amount received from all sources exceeds 80% of your pre-disability earnings.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, if you become disabled, your disability payments may be influenced by social security benefits received from the United States Social Security Act, the Canada Pension Plan, and the Quebec Pension Plan, or any similar plan or act. The amount of these concurrent payments will depend on factors such as your age, earnings, and eligibility criteria under each respective plan's regulations. These plans may provide partial or total replacement of income during disability, up to a maximum percentage set by each program.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, sections [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4] on page 16, retirement payments received by you or your children may be reduced if you're concurrently receiving retirement benefits under the United States Social Security Act, Canada Pension Plan, Quebec Pension Plan, or any similar plans/acts. These reductions apply to the total amount of retirement income from this policy and the specified sources. The extent of reduction depends on the specific terms of each plan/act and is subject to adjustments based on the applicable laws.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, retirement payments received do not include those initiated at age 62 or the normal retirement age under your employer's plan if they stem from post-tax contributions. The policy considers all such payments as distributed across your lifetime. Rolled-over or transferred amounts are excluded. Unum adheres to the Internal Revenue Code Section 402 definition of an eligible retirement plan, which may be amended in future. Retirement payments under any governmental system are not included within post-tax contributions.
<EOS>
This information from Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages [16, 17] outlines key aspects regarding disability and retirement payments under an employer's plan. Disability payments are those benefits paid due to disability that do not reduce the retirement benefit if not for the disability. Retirement payments are based on your employer's contributions to the plan.

Disability benefits that reduce the retirement benefit will also be considered as a retirement benefit. Simultaneous distribution of retirement funds and contributions throughout your lifetime is assumed by Unum. Rolled-over or transferred amounts are not included in received amounts, following the definition of an eligible retirement plan under Section 402 of the Internal Revenue Code, including any future amendments.

These disability or retirement payments will be distributed when you reach either age 62 or the normal retirement age as defined by your employer's plan. LTD-BEN-5 (12/1/2015) 15 applies to these arrangements.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Cert 5019931.pdf (page 17, rows 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3), the payment you receive under Title 46, United States Code Section 688 will only be reduced by deductible income sources related to the same disability. In contrast, your Social Security retirement income will not be considered a reduction factor if your disability commences post-age 65 and you were already receiving such benefits prior. Exceptions apply to retirement payments.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, several income sources are not subject to deduction from your disability payment. These include, but are not limited to: 401(k) plans, profit sharing plans, thrift plans, tax sheltered annuities, stock ownership plans, non-qualified deferred compensation plans, pension plans for partners, military pensions and disability income, credit disability insurance, franchise disability income plans, retirement plans from another employer, individual retirement accounts (IRA), individual disability income plans, no fault motor vehicle plans, salary continuation or accumulated sick leave plans.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages 17 rows [1, 1, 2, 1], the minimum monthly disability payment is either $100 or 10% of your gross disability benefit. The larger figure applies. Unum has the right to use this amount towards any outstanding overpayments.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Cert 5019931.pdf (rows [1, 2, 3, 1, 2] on pages [17, 18]), once a deductible source of income has been subtracted from your gross disability payment, any subsequent cost-of-living increases from that same source will not further reduce your payment. This policy update took effect on December 1, 2015 (LTD-BEN-6).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages [18, 19], monthly payments will be sent until the maximum period of payment based on your age at disability. If you're under 62 or Social Security Normal Retirement Age (SSNRA), payments continue up to SSNRA age. For those aged 62, payments last 60 months; 63, 48 months; 64, 42 months; 65, 36 months; 66, 30 months; 67, 24 months; 68, 18 months; and 69 or older, 12 months. The Social Security Normal Retirement Age varies from 65 years (1937-1954), 65 years 2-6 months (1938-1942), 65 years 8-10 months (1943-1959), to 67 years (1960 and after). This schedule is subject to modifications per the LTD-BEN-7 policy effective December 1, 2015.

According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on page 3, row 2, the death benefit percentage is set at 60%. This means that in the event of the insured's demise, 60% of the policy's face value will be distributed to the beneficiary.

It's essential to adhere to the policy guidelines for a valid claim submission and prompt payment processing.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, the Minimum Monthly Benefit is set at $100 or 10% of the Insured Employee's Monthly Benefit, whichever is greater.

According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, 'Actively at Work' refers to an Employee performing their main duties for the regular hours, either at the usual workplace or any designated travel location required by the Employer. An employee is considered 'Actively at Work' on days that are not scheduled workdays such as Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, paid vacations, or non-medical leave of absence (12 weeks or less).

<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf (page [5], rows [1-8]) details the calculation of Determination Date, the last day worked before Disability begins. The figure is based on the Insured Employee's W-2 form income before taxes and pre-tax contributions to Section 125 Plan, flexible spending account, Section 401K Plan or qualified deferred compensation plan. Exclusions include employer contributions to a deferred compensation plan, car, housing, moving allowance, and income from sources other than the Employer. The earnings will not exceed the lesser of the amount shown in the Employer's financial records, premium-paid amount, or Maximum Covered Monthly Earnings (Maximum Covered Monthly Earnings equals Maximum Monthly Benefit divided by Benefit Percentage shown in the Schedule of Benefits). An exception applies for determining Partial Disability Monthly Benefit where Basic Monthly Earnings will not exceed the amount shown in the Employer's financial records. For Insured Employees without a W-2 form prior to the Determination Date, earnings are averaged from monthly gross earnings during the employment period as shown in the Employer's financial records.

Main Duties are tasks as described in the U.S. Department of Labor Dictionary of Occupational Titles and those performed within the general labor market and national economy, not limited to specific tasks for a certain firm or work site. The inability of an employer to modify or omit other job tasks does not imply that the insured employee is unable to perform their Main Duties.

For Total Disability, the payout could be up to 60% of the pre-disability earnings, while for Partial Disability, it's a portion less than that, determined based on the extent of disability. The policy starts providing benefits after a specified elimination period (usually 90 days) and continues until the employee recovers or reaches the policy's maximum duration.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, 'Own Occupation' refers to the employment, trade, or profession in which the Insured Employee was engaged prior to Disability and served as their primary source of earned income. This term follows the U.S. Department of Labor Dictionary of Occupational Titles definition, encompassing any similar work conducted for pay or profit regardless of whether it's with the Employer, another firm, or self-employed.

The benefit does not represent contributions made by the insured employee; instead, these are considered received over their expected remaining life, regardless of when they're actually received. If the insured becomes disabled, the payment may reduce the benefit that would have been paid at normal retirement age under the plan if disability hadn't occurred.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, a Retirement Plan refers to defined benefit or contribution plans that offer retirement benefits to employees and are not solely funded by employee contributions.

<EOS>
Under the Lincoln Cert 5439095 policy, the term 'Total Covered Payroll' refers to the combined monthly base earnings of all employees insured. This amount is crucial in determining various aspects related to the coverage provided. The policy specifies that changes to this payroll figure can affect the premium amounts and benefit calculations, necessitating regular updates for accuracy. For instance, new hires or wage increases may require adjustments to the total covered payroll.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 9 (rows 1-4, 1-2, 3-4, 1-2), Total Disability is defined as follows: During the Elimination and Own Occupation periods, an Insured Employee is unable to perform each main duty of their specific occupation due to an Injury or Sickness. After the Own Occupation period, they are incapable of performing any occupation for which their education, training, or experience qualifies, except that loss of a professional, occupational license, or driver's license does not by itself constitute Total Disability. This policy does not consider an employee Totally Disabled solely due to the absence of these licenses.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 9, rows 2-4, the Waiting Period refers to the duration an Employee must be employed in an eligible class before becoming eligible for policy coverage.

<EOS>
According to the policy outlined in Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, after two years from its issue date, the validity of the policy is non-contestable unless due to non-payment of premiums or fraud. This also applies to any Insured Employee's coverage that has been active for two years throughout their lifetime.

This does not restrict the contention of these aforementioned issues during the policy's lifetime.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, during the first two years of coverage, the insurer has the right to rescind an insurance policy if an Insured Employee incurs a claim and the company discovers a Material Misrepresentation on their application. A Material Misrepresentation is any incomplete or untrue statement that would have led the company to deny coverage had they known the truth. Rescission cancels the insurance back to its effective date, with the company refunding all premiums paid less any benefits for the employee's claims. The company also reserves the right to recover any excess claim payments.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, any misstated facts regarding an insured employee may lead to a reassessment of the premium and the validity of insurance under the policy. Specifically, if an insured's age has been incorrectly stated, benefits will be determined based on the amount the paid premium would have purchased at the correct age. It is important to note that the true facts will ultimately decide whether and in what amount insurance is valid.
<EOS>

Benefits are provided for work-related injuries, illnesses, or disabilities as stipulated by these laws. The policy covers a portion of the employee's wages during their recovery period. For example, under Workers' Compensation, an employee may receive up to 66% and 2/3rds of their average weekly wage, while State Disability Insurance benefits are typically around 55-70% of the employee's weekly wage.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 11, benefits due for less than a month are paid proportionally (on a pro rata basis) at a daily rate equating to 1/30 of the Monthly Benefit. Any outstanding balance not settled within the policy period will be paid immediately post-claim confirmation and receipt of complete proof.
<EOS>
Benefits from Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf are primarily payable to the Insured Employee during their lifetime. Upon death, specific survivor benefits follow the outlined provisions. Any remaining benefits are distributed to the Insured Employee's estate. If payment is needed for the estate, a minor, or an incompetent person, up to $1,000 can be given to any entitled relative. The company will not require additional payment if funds are distributed in good faith to such relatives.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on page 12, the insurance company is required to issue a written claim decision notice to the insured employee within 15 days after resolving the claim or 45 days following the first proof of claim submission, whichever is reasonable.

<EOS>
Within 180 days after receiving a denial notice, the Insured Employee of Lincoln Cert 5439095 can request a review by submitting a written request and any supporting documents. The Company will then examine the claim, providing a written decision notice within either 45 or 90 days. This notice details the reasons for the decision, outlines further appeal procedures under the Policy, grants access to relevant claim information, allows requesting a state insurance department review, or initiating legal action. The notice also explains these rights if all or part of the claim is upheld. Critical documents can be found on page 12, rows [2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2].

This entails seeking two reviews of the adverse claim decision in accordance with this section. Once these required reviews are completed, the ERISA plan participant or beneficiary may then initiate legal action under Section 502(a) of ERISA.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 13, rows 1-3, indicates that the Company waives any right to assert that a claimant failed to exhaust administrative remedies. This means that if there are issues regarding the exhaustion of administrative remedies, the Company will not use it as a defense in court. The waiver applies regardless of whether the claim is under ERISA or other applicable laws. However, this does not preclude the Company from challenging any other aspect of the claim, such as its validity, coverage, or terms. The Company reserves the right to contest any procedural errors that may affect the merits of a claim.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf outlines the Right of Recovery concerning overpayments on short-term or long-term disability benefits.

<EOS>
According to the Individual Termination section of Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 16, rows 1, 1, and 2, the policy grants a 4% reduction in the base rate if the insured terminates their coverage during the specified time period GL3002-CERT-8 04 14 01/01/21.

Based on Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, upon cessation of active work, the insured employee's insurance eligibility terminates. However, continuation of coverage is possible under specific conditions. If the group policy offers this option and the employer elects to continue it, the employee may maintain insurance coverage at 102% of the standard premium rate during their disability leave or for up to 6 months following the end of active work, whichever is shorter. This continuation period can be extended under certain circumstances, such as a change in the group policy or employer's election to continue coverage beyond the initial 6-month limit.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 16 (rows 3-6, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3), disability coverage continues during the Elimination Period if the company receives the necessary premium from the employer.

Under the Total Disability Monthly Benefit of Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, a policyholder with GL3002-CERT-9 is entitled to total disability benefits starting from January 1, 2021.

This benefit continues until age 65 or the policy term ends, whichever comes first. It's essential to note that this benefit is available only for total disability, as defined in the policy. The benefit amount is not specified in this section but may be determined by other policy provisions.

According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on page [19], the insured employee will receive Partial Disability Monthly Benefits upon completion of the Elimination Period if they are partially disabled, engaged in partial disability employment, earning at least 20% of pre-disability income when this begins, under regular physician care, and submit proof to the company. The employee need not be totally disabled before receiving benefits. The elimination period can be satisfied by days of total or partial disability. Benefits cease upon the earliest of: the date the employee stops being partially disabled or dies; end of the maximum benefit period; earning more than 99% of pre-disability income for 24 months, or 85% after 24 months; or choosing not to work full-time in own occupation during the own occupation period, or any occupation after that period.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 18, rows [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2], the Total Disability Monthly Benefit is calculated as the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings multiplied by the Benefit Percentage (up to the Maximum Monthly Benefit), minus Other Income Benefits. The benefit amount will not be less than the Minimum Monthly Benefit, but if the sum of these benefits plus Other Income Benefits exceeds 100% of the Basic Monthly Earnings, the minimum benefit is adjusted accordingly. The Benefit Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period can be found in the Schedule of Benefits.

<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on page 20 rows 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit serves as a replacement for an Insured Employee's lost income when not exceeding the Total Disability Monthly Benefit. This partial benefit amount is the lesser of A or B: A being the actual earnings from work during partial disability, reduced by the amount earned in the month prior to disability onset, or B, which is the difference between the total disability monthly benefit and any income received from sources other than the policy during the period of partial disability. The total disability monthly benefit would have been payable had there been no partial disability employment.
<EOS>
This policy in Lincoln Cert 5439095 clarifies that the compensated predisability income of the insured employee will be reduced by any other income benefits received, excluding earnings from partial disability employment. The reduction applies to the lost income benefit. This adjustment is effective on the date of disability and continues until the employee returns to work or reaches the policy's maximum duration. The percentage of income replacement will depend on the specific plan details. It is essential to understand that any other income benefits, such as social security or workers' compensation, may impact the lost income benefit under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on page 20, row 3, if you become totally disabled due to sickness or injury, you're eligible for a monthly benefit of $5,000, payable until age 67. This benefit is subject to a 24-month elimination period during which no payments are made. The policy definition of total disability requires you to be unable to perform the material and substantial duties of your regular occupation due to a sickness or injury. Additionally, if you return to any occupation within 36 months following the onset date, the monthly benefit will cease unless your earnings are less than 20% of your pre-disability monthly earnings. The policy also provides for residual total disability benefits under certain conditions.

According to the Insured section of Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, located on page 20, row 6, the policy covers 'Employee A' as the insured party. The insured is entitled to a coverage amount of $500,000 for accidental death and dismemberment benefits. This coverage begins from the effective date of the policy and continues until the termination or expiration of the policy. Additionally, there is a provision for a partial benefit payout in case of loss of sight, speech, hearing, or use of specific limbs. Furthermore, the insured is required to maintain employment with the company throughout the term of the policy to remain eligible for these benefits. The age of the insured at the time of the event will determine the exact amount of benefits paid out.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 20 rows 9-11, the Income section outlines the policy's treatment of beneficiary income. If a beneficiary receives income from any source other than the policy, this income will be subtracted from the benefit amount received under the policy. The reduction applies to income earned during the period starting on the policy effective date and ending on the death of the insured or policy maturity. This reduction rate is 100% for income received within 24 months after the policy's effective date, then decreases gradually to 0% after the 5th anniversary of the policy. The specific percentage of reduction depends on the number of completed policy years since issue and is outlined in a table provided in the document. Additionally, any interest or dividends received from this policy will not be subject to this income reduction provision.
<EOS>
According to the Benefit section of Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 20, rows [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3], the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit is calculated as a percentage that does not exceed the Maximum Monthly Benefit. This percentage deducts two other income benefits, except for wages from Partial Disability Employment. It's essential to note that the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit will never be less than the Minimum Monthly Benefit. The Benfits Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period are outlined in the Schedule of Benefits.
<EOS>
Under the Other Income Benefits of Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, a supplemental income plan is presented on row 1. This plan, GL3002-CERT-11-INT, provides integration with Primary and Family Social Security Income starting from January 1, 2021. The integration applies to any Occurrence of Disability. Notably, the plan includes a benefit amount of $10,190 annually, effective on the 19th of each month.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf (page 21, rows 2-4), any additional income benefits received by the insured employee will be offset when calculating their monthly benefit. These benefits can originate from various sources such as awards, settlements, or earnings, excluding retirement benefits and income earned during able-bodied periods. However, to be considered for offset, these alternative incomes must stem from the same disability that warrants a monthly benefit under the policy.
<EOS>
According to the Workers' Compensation section on Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf page [21], eligible employees are entitled to benefits resulting from job-related injuries or sicknesses. This may stem from any applicable Workers' Compensation or occupational disease law, Jones Act, Longshoreman's and Harbor Worker's Act, Maritime Doctrine of Maintenance, Wages or Cure, or a substitute plan. Benefits encompass partial or total disability, whether temporary or permanent, as well as vocational rehabilitation. This policy may provide compensation for these aspects.
<EOS>
This policy under Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf acknowledges potential compulsory benefits beyond disability income. These may stem from state temporary disability income laws, no-fault auto insurance regulations, or any other relevant compulsory benefit acts or laws. Eligibility for these benefits is contingent upon the applicable legislation in your jurisdiction. For instance, under state temporary disability income benefit laws, you might be entitled to a percentage of your wages during the period of your disability, subject to specific maximum and minimum limits. Similarly, no-fault auto insurance regulations could provide compensation for medical expenses or lost wages resulting from an automobile accident, regardless of fault. It is essential to understand these provisions as they may affect your overall benefits under this policy.
<EOS>
According to the details in Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 21 and specifically rows 1, 2, 1, and 2, any other group insurance plans (excluding credit or mortgage insurance) or no-fault auto plans could potentially affect disability income benefits for the insured employee. If the employee receives such coverage elsewhere, it may impact their eligibility under this policy.
<EOS>
This policy from Lincoln Cert 5439095 clarifies that disability income benefits for an insured employee do not encompass vacation pay, severance pay, or payment for work performed during a disability under the Employer's Sick Leave or Salary Continuance Plan. These provisions exclude these specific forms of remuneration, ensuring they are distinct from disability benefits.
<EOS>
According to the Employer's Retirement Plan detailed in Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on page 21, row 2, any Disability or Retirement Benefits received by the Insured Employee are subject to certain regulations. The benefits percentage is defined by the Employer's retirement plan and may not exceed the lesser of $6,000 per month or 60% of the Average Compensation. These benefits commence upon the earlier of the Social Security Normal Retirement Age or the date the Employee completes 15 years of service with the Employer. The benefits will terminate if the Employee's employment is terminated for any reason other than disability or retirement, or upon the Employee's death. If the Employee retires before attaining Social Security Normal Retirement Age, the reduction in benefits is based on the number of years between the retirement age and the actual retirement age, not exceeding 5% per year. The Plan further states that any amounts distributed from this benefit prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on page 21 under row numbers 2, 1, and 1, certain Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits will be subject to offset. If you receive benefits from these plans concurrently with your insurance policy, a percentage of the latter may be reduced to account for the former. The exact reduction percentage will depend on various factors, such as the type and amount of benefits received, as well as any applicable state laws. It's essential to note that this offset will not affect survivor benefits payable to your spouse or dependent children. The offset provision applies only to your own benefit payments. To ensure compliance with this policy, you are advised to provide written confirmation of any Social Security or Government Retirement Plan benefits you receive while your insurance policy is active.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, page 21, row 3, a child can receive disability benefits due to the Insured Employee's own disability. The eligibility requirements include the child being under the age of 26 and either unmarried or incapable of self-support at the time of disability. The benefit payable is 75% of the monthly base salary of the Insured Employee, subject to a maximum limit. Additionally, this benefit continues until the end of the policy term or until the child no longer meets the eligibility criteria.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf at pages 21, rows 3, 4, and 1, unreduced retirement benefits for the Insured Employee are detailed. These benefits may extend eligibility to a spouse or child if they meet certain conditions, stemming from the Insured Employee's eligibility. Notably, a specific percentage of these benefits can be payable upon the Insured Employee's death, with payments commencing at a specified future date after their passing. The amount payable to eligible dependents may also be subject to a cap or reduction based on other sources of income they receive. It is essential to note that any changes in employment status, marital status, or dependent status could impact these benefits, so it's crucial to promptly notify the plan administrator of such changes.
<EOS>
This document, Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf (page 21), clarifies that reduced retirement benefits received by the Insured Employee or their spouse could impact the policy. These benefits include disability and retirement plans such as the federal Social Security Act, Jones Act, Railroad Retirement Act, Canada Pension Plan, Quebec Pension Plan, and any similar plans from countries, states, provinces, or political units. They also extend to any plan replacing one of the above mentioned plans. Such Government Retirement Plans are subject to a maximum offset of up to 60% for disability benefits and 50% for retirement benefits.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on page [22], earnings for this provision denote the income an insured employee receives or earns from any occupation, as reported for federal income tax purposes. This includes gross salaries or hourly wages (shown on Form W-2), comprising wages, tips, commissions, bonuses, overtime pay, and pre-tax contributions to Section 125 Plans, flexible spending accounts, or qualified deferred compensation plans.

Proprietors' net profit is calculated from Form 1040, Schedule C, as well as professional corporation shareholders' net profit. Partners' net earnings from self-employment are shown on Schedule K-1, in addition to any W-2 wages they may receive. Subchapter S Corporation shareholders' net earnings from trade or business activities are also included, reported on Schedule K-1.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on page [22], the following income sources will not be considered Other Income Benefits and thus will not be offset during a period of Disability:

1. Cost-of-living increases in any Other Income Benefit (except Earnings), effective only after the first offset;
2. Reimbursement for hospital, medical or surgical expenses;
3. Reimbursement for attorney fees and other costs related to claiming Other Income Benefits;
4. Group credit or mortgage disability insurance benefits;
5. Early retirement benefits not elected or received under the federal Social Security Act or other Government Retirement Plan;
6. Employer's Retirement Plan contributions or receipts upon termination without disability or retirement;
7. Benefits from 401(k), profit-sharing, thrift plans, IRAs, TSAs, stock ownership plans, or non-qualified deferred compensation plans;
8. Vacation pay, holiday pay, or severance pay;
9. Disability income benefits under individual policies, association group plans, franchise plans, auto liability insurance policies (except no fault auto insurance).
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, page 22 row 2, any income benefits that impact policy benefits are subject to the following rules: If an Insured Employee receives Other Income during the time they receive Policy Benefits, a percentage of their Policy Benefits will be reduced. This offset percentage varies based on the type and source of the Other Income received, with Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits being fully offset, while public disability benefits or workers' compensation benefits may be subject to a partial offset, not exceeding 60%. The exact offset amount is determined by applying the applicable federal income tax withholdings to the Policy Benefits. This reduction will continue until the Other Income ceases or the Insured Employee reaches age 65. Additionally, if an Insured Employee receives a lump sum settlement, this amount may also be subject to an offset based on the same rules and percentages. The policy defines Other Income as any income or compensation received by an employee from sources other than the group policy and employer contributions.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf policy section on Claiming Other Income Benefits (page 22, rows 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2) outlines the responsibilities of an Insured Employee when Other Income Benefits are possible. If benefits could be payable under the federal Social Security Act, the employee must apply promptly, request reconsideration upon denial, and request a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge if denied again. An Employer is required to assist in filing Workers' Compensation or similar claims when applicable. Failure by the employee to pursue Other Income Benefits on time allows the Company to either deny or suspend Monthly Benefits, or reduce them by an estimated amount.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, during a Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan claim pending period, the Insured Employee must choose, in writing, one of two options regarding Monthly Benefits. If no written election is made, reduction will occur according to Option 1:

Option 1: The Employee's benefits are reduced by 20% for early retirement (before age 62) or 13.33% for retirement at age 62 or older. This reduction continues until the Social Security or Government Retirement Plan benefit starts.

Option 2: The Employee's benefits remain unreduced and return to their full amount once the Social Security or Government Retirement Plan benefit begins. However, if the Employee subsequently cancels this election in writing or fails to elect at all, the original reduction (as per Option 1) applies retroactively from the start of Monthly Benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, the Insured Employee may receive reduced Monthly Benefits if estimated Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits are present. The company will modify and refund any underpayment in a lump sum upon providing proof of either:
1. the exact awarded amount
2. claim denial, followed by completion of any required Company-mandated appeal process. This adjustment and refund procedure applies to the information found on pages 23, rows [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 1].
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, the Insured Employee may receive unreduced Monthly Benefits while a claim is pending. However, should overpayment occur upon receiving Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits, the employee must refund this amount in a lump sum promptly to avoid consequences. If an overpaid amount is not repaid promptly, the Company reserves the right to reduce or eliminate future payments and suspend the Minimum Monthly Benefit until repayment is made.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 23 and relevant rows, lump sum Other Income Benefits are pro-rated monthly over their respective durations if specified. If no duration is provided, the company applies its estimated monthly offset until full compensation is recouped. If an estimated monthly offset was not previously implemented for that benefit, the lump sum is pro-rated over a reasonable time period not exceeding 60 months or the Maximum Benefit Period, whichever comes first.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, the cost-of-living freeze provision specifies that after the initial deduction of each Other Income Benefit (except Earnings), no further reduction will be made to the Monthly Benefit due to any potential cost-of-living increases under these benefits. This means that the amount of the Monthly Benefit will remain frozen, shielding it from any increase in cost-of-living adjustments associated with the Other Income Benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 24 rows 1 and 1-2, the Recurrent Disability section applies when you become disabled again following an initial disability period of at least 12 months. During this subsequent period, if you're unable to perform the essential duties of any occupation deemed suitable based on your education, training, or experience, you may receive disability benefits. The benefit percentage is determined by dividing your average monthly earnings during the base period by the policy maximum and rounding down to the nearest whole number. For GL3002-CERT-12 04 22 01/01/21, this means a maximum of 66.67% can be paid out if eligible. The disability benefit period for this section is capped at age 65 or the end of the policy term, whichever comes first.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 24 rows 2, 3, and 1, a Recurrent Disability refers to a condition identical or related to one for which Monthly Benefits were previously paid. This recurring disability is managed as follows:

1. If the Recurrent Disability begins within 90 days after the end of the previous disability period, benefits will be paid from the first day of the Recurrent Disability without requiring a new Evidence of Insurability (EOI).
2. If the Recurrent Disability occurs beyond the 90-day mark, an EOI may be required if the insurance company deems it necessary.
3. Any benefits paid during this second period will be reduced by the amount already received for the prior disability, but the total combined benefit duration cannot exceed the policy maximum.
<EOS>
According to the details provided in Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf (page 24, rows 3-7, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1), a Recurrent Disability is considered a new Disability under certain conditions. The Insured Employee must return to their Own Occupation with the Employer on a full-time basis for at least the Minimum Number of Hours Per Week as indicated in the Schedule of Benefits and maintain this employment for six consecutive months or more following the end of prior Disability benefits. After returning, a new Elimination Period must be completed before Monthly Benefits can be resumed, and a new Maximum Benefit Period will apply.

A Recurrent Disability is treated as part of the prior Disability if it occurs within six months following the end of prior Disability benefits, or if certain conditions are met: job unavailability with the employer, policy termination, new employment with full-time hours on the Schedule of Benefits without other group long-term disability plan coverage, and no benefits under another such plan. No new Elimination Period is required for further Monthly Benefits, and the same Maximum Benefit Period, Exclusions, Limitations, and Predisability Income apply. Reinstated benefits are subject to the Policy's terms effective at the prior Disability onset. To qualify for a Monthly Benefit, the Insured Employee or former Employee must earn less than the specified percentage of Predisability Income in the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit section. All other policy terms apply. This provision ceases to apply if the employee becomes eligible for coverage under another group long-term disability plan.

This Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf section on Voluntary Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit (GL3002-CERT-14.3) outlines a benefit available for policyholders. The benefit amount is determined by the percentage of loss, with up to $30,000 provided after 90 days of disability and up to $60,000 total. Rehabilitation services must commence within one year from the date of injury or diagnosis. Coverage includes vocational evaluation, training, counseling, and job placement services, and continues until the policyholder's return to work or until the benefit limit is reached. The provision becomes effective on January 1, 2021.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 5439095 document on page 30 outlines a Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit for disabled Insured Employees. Eligible individuals may receive services such as vocational evaluation, counseling, training, job placement, job modification, special equipment, and other necessary assistance to aid in returning to work. The Company is responsible for determining eligibility and the amount of any payable benefit.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, an eligible employee must meet the following criteria: Firstly, they must have a disability preventing them from performing their regular occupation, and subsequently lack skills, training, or experience for any other gainful occupation after the Own Occupation Period. Secondly, they should possess the physical and mental abilities required to complete a Program. Thirdly, there is an expectation that they will return to work post-Program based on their motivation level and demand for workers in the proposed occupation. The cost of services must be less than the Company's projected claim liability.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 30, rows 2, 1, 2, and 3, the Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit's payment will not exceed the company's anticipated claims liability. This benefit is not payable for services covered under the insured employee's healthcare plan or any other vocational rehabilitation program. The provider of these services may receive payment at the company's discretion.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, either the insurance company, the insured employee, or their physician can initiate a vocational rehabilitation program. During this rehab period, the definition of Disability is waived. Upon conclusion of the program, the company will reassess and determine long-term disability benefits, including amount and duration. If approved, the rehabilitation period suspends the policy's original Disability definition.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, on page 30 row 2, if an insured employee receives Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit and fails to complete the program without good cause, their disability will not be covered by the policy. The term 'good cause' is not explicitly defined but it is implied that it refers to exceptional or unforeseen circumstances. This rule applies to any period of disability following the incomplete vocational rehab program. The specifics may vary depending on the policy details and definitions provided elsewhere in the document.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf outlines the definition of 'Good Cause' under Section [30][1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2]. It includes documented physical or mental impairments preventing participation in a program (row [1]), involvement in a medical program interfering with a program (row [2]), or good-faith participation in other vocational rehabilitation if it conflicts with the Company's program and is reasonably expected to return the Insured Employee to work (rows [3, 1, 2]). The specified vocational rehabilitation must be reasonable in expectation of returning the employee to work.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 30, rows [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], a Program refers to a vocational rehabilitation plan that the Company constructs, with collaboration from the Insured Employee, their Physician, and potential employers when necessary. The program outlines its objectives, assigns responsibilities for each party involved, and specifies the timelines, dates, and costs associated with rehabilitation services.

If an insured employee is disabled and receiving policy benefits, their employer may be eligible for reimbursement covering 50% of the costs incurred for reasonable accommodation services. This benefit cap is set at $5,000 per employee or the company's expected liability for the employee's long-term disability claim (whichever is less). Eligible services encompass providing a more accessible parking space or entrance, removing worksite barriers, special seating or equipment, supplying training materials or translation services during training, and any other deemed necessary services to assist the employee in returning to work with the employer.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, an employer qualifies for the Benefit if they have an employee whose disability prevents performing their regular occupation at the worksite, but they can perform the job with reasonable accommodation. The employee must also be expected to return to work with such accommodation and the requested Reasonable Accommodation Benefit should be less than the anticipated liability for the employee's Long Term Disability claim. These details are found on page 31, rows [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2].
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, the written proposal for reasonable accommodation services is collaboratively developed involving the Employer, Insured Employee, and the employee's Physician when necessary. The proposal outlines the purpose of the proposed accommodation, along with details regarding the times, dates, and costs of these services. This information must be included in the proposal for the services to be provided accordingly.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, either the Company, Employer, Insured Employee, or their Physician can propose an accommodation for the employee's condition. The proposal needs written approval from the Company. Once approved, the Company will reimburse the Employer upon receiving proof that: a) they provided the specified services to the Insured Employee, and b) they paid the service provider for these services. This reimbursement takes place after such verification. No specific dates or percentages are mentioned in this section.
<EOS>
Under the Prior Insurance Credit section of Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, certain employees will receive coverage continuity to prevent loss due to insurance carrier transfers. This policy grants credit for employees insured under the previous carrier's policy upon its termination (1/01/21). The amount of credit provided is based on the proportion of time each employee was covered by the prior policy relative to the total coverage period in this new policy. For instance, if an employee was covered for 6 months out of a 12-month policy term, they would receive 50% Prior Insurance Credit. This benefit ensures that employees do not experience gaps in coverage due to insurer changes.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 32 and relevant rows, this policy provides coverage for an employee who was insured under a previous carrier's policy at the time of transfer and was not actively-at-work due to injury or sickness on the policy's effective date. The coverage provided will be equivalent to that offered by the previous policy, had it remained in force. The Company agrees to pay the benefit that the prior carrier would have paid, minus any amount for which the prior carrier is responsible. This arrangement applies only to employees who meet these conditions and whose premium payments are current.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf section discusses disability benefits for a pre-existing condition under the following conditions:

1. The employee was insured by the previous carrier's policy at the time of transfer and was actively employed and insured on the Policy's Effective Date.
2. Benefits will be determined based on the Policy's Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion. If the employee qualifies for benefits, they will receive payment according to the Policy's benefit schedule.
3. If the employee cannot meet the Policy's Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion but can fulfill it under the previous carrier's terms considering continuous coverage under both policies, they will be paid based on the Policy's or the previous carrier's benefit schedule and terms, whichever is less.
4. If the employee fails to satisfy either policy's Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion, no benefits will be disbursed.

If an Insured Employee dies after being disabled for 180 or more days while receiving a Monthly Benefit, the company will pay a lump sum equal to three times their Last Monthly Benefit (gross amount prior to death). No reductions are made for Other Income Benefits or Partial Disability Employment earnings. The Eligible Survivor is either the Insured Employee's surviving spouse or, in their absence, the under-25 children. If multiple children are eligible, payment is distributed equally; otherwise, a designated representative may receive it on their behalf. This payment holds validity against all claims by others representing or claiming to represent the children.

According to the Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf (page 34, rows 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2), if an insured employee is receiving either a Partial Disability Monthly Benefit or a Total Disability Benefit under the policy and is terminally ill, suffering from cognitive impairment, or experiencing loss of activities of daily living, they are eligible for Family Care Expense reimbursement. This benefit is over and above all other policy benefits, and it will not be reduced by any Other Income Benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, the Insured Employee is required to provide monthly proof of Family Care Expenses for a Dependent. The submitted evidence must include the Dependent's name, age, reason for care if the Dependent exceeds the defined maximum age, dates and total charges/payments for care, and the provider's details such as name, address, and telephone number. If the Dependent's age surpasses the specified maximum, a valid explanation is also required. Failure to provide this information may impact eligibility for reimbursement.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 5439095 document, specifically on page 34 row 1, mandates the provision of a Number/Taxpayer Identification Number. The assigned ID number is essential for policy administration, claim processing, and communicating with the policyholder throughout the policy term. The policyholder is required to keep this number updated at all times to ensure seamless service delivery. Any changes made should be reported promptly to avoid potential delays or complications.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 34, rows 2, the Family Care Expense Benefit amounts are determined by actual expenses paid by the insured. Eligible dependents can receive up to $250 per month, however, this benefit is only for expenses that aren't reimbursable from other sources.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, the Family Care Expense Benefit terminates under three conditions: firstly, upon cessation of the Insured Employee's Total or Partial Disability Benefits under the policy; secondly, when the Insured Employee's Dependents no longer fit the definition of a Dependent as per this provision; and lastly, after the Company has made 12 consecutive monthly Family Care Expense Benefit payments.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, on page 34 row 2, the term "Child" encompasses the Insured Employee's biological child, legally adopted child, stepchild, foster child, or a child for whom the Insured Employee is the legal guardian. This coverage extends to all such children regardless of their age, as long as they meet the policy's eligibility criteria. Specifically, these children must be under the Insured Employee's care and not have reached the maximum age limit specified in the policy. For details regarding this or any other aspect of the policy, please consult the comprehensive document.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, "Cognitive Impairment" refers to a permanent decline in cognitive or intellectual abilities that necessitates continuous assistance or verbal guidance to prevent harm to the Insured Employee or Dependent. This impairment is medically diagnosed by a Physician using clinical evidence and standardized tests of memory, orientation, and reasoning. It can stem from moderate to severe head trauma, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, or other irreversible dementias. The diagnosis must be based on reliable evidence derived from short or long-term memory assessments, understanding of personal, spatial, and temporal contexts, as well as abstract reasoning capabilities.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 35 and various rows, a dependent is defined as the Insured Employee's legal spouse (living with the employee and incapable of independent living due to a mental or physical condition), child below age 16, unmarried child aged 16 years or older (living with the employee and incapable of independent living due to a mental or physical condition), or parent/parent-in-law (living with the employee and incapable of independent living due to a mental or physical condition). These dependents must reside with the Insured Employee and have conditions that prevent them from living independently.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 35 and the specified row numbers, 'Family Care Expense' refers to costs for caring for a non-immediate family Dependent by a licensed provider, who does not reside in the Insured Employee's home. This expense is eligible for coverage as long as it meets the outlined requirements of the policy. The relevant section emphasizes that these costs can be substantial and are typically charged by professional care providers.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, a Dependent qualifies as "Incapable of Independent Living" if they are terminally ill, suffering from cognitive impairment, or experiencing a loss of Activities of Daily Living. A dependent is considered terminally ill when they have less than 12 months to live, cognitively impaired if they cannot perform at least two of six specified tasks, and loss of Activities of Daily Living requires assistance with at least two tasks for more than 90 days. The policy provides benefits to help the dependent with their care in such situations.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 35 (rows 2, 3, 1, 1), the term "Loss of Activities of Daily Living" refers to an insured employee or dependent's inability to safely and independently perform at least two out of six essential daily activities without substantial assistance. These activities include eating, toileting, transferring (moving from a bed to chair), bathing, dressing, and continence. This loss must be due to a covered injury or illness, and the inability pertains to the individual's entire body functions rather than a localized condition. The inability must persist for an extended period, not just temporarily.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, a Terminally Ill status is given when an Insured Employee or Dependent has a medical condition that is expected to lead to death within 12 months, despite receiving appropriate treatment. This classification triggers certain benefits. The timeline for this condition is strictly enforced, with the diagnosis determining the policyholder's eligibility for benefits during the following 12-month period.

The benefit amount for eligible total disability is a monthly payment equal to 60% of your pre-disability earnings up to a maximum of $15,000 per month. For partial disability, the benefit ranges from 20% to 60% of the pre-disability earnings based on the nature and extent of your occupation.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, the Maximum Benefit Period for Sickness, Injury, or Pre-Existing Conditions is dependent on the Insured's age at disability.

According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, found on page 3, row 15, the OWN Occupation Period lasts from the end of the Elimination Period until the Maximum Benefit Period for Insured Employees. During this period, if an insured employee is unable to perform the material and substantial duties of their own occupation due to a disability, they will receive benefits. However, it's essential to note that once the insured can perform the material and substantial duties of any gainful occupation, even if not in the same field as before the disability, the benefits will cease. The Maximum Benefit Period for Insured Employees is not explicitly stated in this document but may vary depending on the specific policy terms.
<EOS>

This waiting period does not apply to the Accelerated Benefit Rider or the Critical Illness Rider.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf on pages 4 (rows 21, 22), insured employees are compelled to make contributions towards their Long-Term Disability coverage. The contribution rate is set at 0.2% of the employee's base salary per pay period. These contributions begin one month following the effective date of the policy and continue throughout the term of employment. Any changes to the employee's base salary will result in corresponding modifications to their contribution amount. Additionally, the employer also contributes towards this coverage at a rate of 0.5% of the employee's base salary per pay period. This collective contribution ensures the ongoing provision of Long-Term Disability benefits should an insured employee become disabled and unable to work for an extended period.
<EOS>

According to the Lincoln Policy 5293231, the term "Basic Monthly Earnings" or "Predisability Income" refers to an employee's base salary or hourly pay before taxes on their last working day prior to disability commencement.

In the case of Partial Disability, Basic Monthly Earnings will not surpass the figure shown in the employer's financial records.

<EOS>

Under FMLA, leaves can span up to 12 weeks within a 12-month period as defined by the employer, which can be taken consecutively or intermittently, or on a part-time equivalency basis. If an employee is entitled to leave under both federal and state laws, they may opt for the more favorable one (but not both).

Under the Lincoln Policy 5293231, an injury qualifies as a covered event if it is an accidental bodily injury that requires treatment by a Physician and directly and independently of all other causes, results in a Disability that commences while the Insured Employee is under this Policy coverage.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, the main duties or material and substantial duties refer to job tasks that are customarily performed by an insured employee and cannot be reasonably modified or omitted. The assessment of reasonable modification or omission considers the standards outlined in the Americans with Disabilities Act regarding reasonable accommodation. This evaluation applies regardless if the employer is subject to the Act or if the insured employee has requested a job accommodation. An employer's failure to modify or omit certain tasks does not deem the insured employee unable to perform their main duties.

The benefit amount varies based on the employee's pre-disability earnings and the specific disability status. For Total Disability, the benefit equals a percentage of the pre-disability earnings, with the exact percentage dependent on the policy provisions. For Partial Disability, the benefit is a fraction of the total disability benefit, proportionate to the degree of disability as determined by the policy provisions. The policy also outlines specific requirements and conditions for claiming Total or Partial Disability, which should be met for the employee to receive benefits. The duration of these benefits is contingent on the employee's continued disability status.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf, the terms 'Own Occupation' or 'Regular Occupation' refer to the job, trade, or profession where the Insured Employee was previously employed before Disability and served as their primary source of earned income prior to that.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, if overpayments occur on short-term or long-term disability benefits, full reimbursement is required within 60 days. Failure to repay allows the company to either reduce future benefits or suspend the Minimum Monthly Benefit, adjust group insurance policies issued by them, or recover the overpayment from the employee or estate. This applies regardless of whether the overpayment stems from their processing error, the employee receiving Other Income Benefits, fraud, misrepresentation, omission of facts, or any other reason. The reimbursement is necessary for errors, income benefits, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other cause.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 15 (rows 58-59), any legal action to recover benefits must wait for a minimum of 60 days following the submission of written proof of claim.

Employees are advised to review their specific plan details for accurate information regarding the Waiting Period.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, prior service credit can be applied towards the waiting period under specific conditions. If a former employee is rehired within one year after their employment ends, or if an employee returns from an approved Family or Medical Leave (either the 12-week leave required by federal law or any longer period mandated by similar state law) or Military Leave (as per federal USERRA law), this prior service can be considered. These instances shorten the waiting period shown in the Schedule of Benefits.

This Lincoln Policy 5293231 specifies the effective dates for an employee's coverage and any subsequent changes. The initial coverage becomes effective at 12:01 a.m. on the first or next Insurance Month following the employee's eligibility, their return to Active Work, or application for coverage submission and approval of necessary forms. Increased or additional coverage takes effect at the latest of these dates if the employee is Actively at Work, resumes Active Work, or provides approved Evidence of Insurability.

The benefit amount is 60% of your monthly base salary, subject to a maximum of $15,000 per month and a minimum of $500 per month. The policy has an elimination period of either 90 or 180 days, as chosen by you at the time of enrollment.

If you elect the 180-day elimination period, you will receive your first benefit payment once you have been continuously disabled for 180 days. If you choose the 90-day elimination period, payments begin after 90 days of continuous disability but only if you are also on a company-approved leave of absence during that time.

The policy offers additional benefits to cover any expenses associated with the recovery process up to $50,000 per event for certain approved procedures and services. The policy terminates at age 65 or upon your return to work, whichever occurs first.

Reinstatement does not require a new waiting period or evidence of insurability. The reinstated coverage can only equal the amount that originally terminated and takes effect on the date the employee returns to active work.

Pre-existing condition exclusion periods are considered during reinstatement, with leave months counting towards any unmet pre-existing condition exclusion period. A new pre-existing condition exclusion will not apply to the reinstated coverage; however, a new one will be applied to any increased amount of insurance. The employee must apply for or be re-enrolled within 31 days following their return to active work in an eligible class. This policy applies to GL3001-LTD-10 as of 01/01/13.

- Additionally, if the employer becomes bankrupt, or if the plan terminates, employees and their families may continue coverage under the federal continuation provisions. These provisions mandate that coverage be offered for up to 18 months, with the employee responsible for paying 102% of the premium.
<EOS>
Under the Lincoln Policy 5293231, disability coverage continues during the Elimination Period, if the Company receives premiums from the Employer. Afterward, coverage endures for the duration of benefits payment without premium charges. Premium waiver applies from satisfying the Elimination Period to the period benefits are payable. If coverage continues post-waived premium periods, regular premium payments must resume upon their due date. Essentially, disability insurance can be maintained throughout the Elimination Period and the time for which benefits are disbursed, with premiums waived until benefits cessation; however, reinstatement of premiums is necessary after such periods.

<EOS>
This Lincoln Policy 5293231 detail stipulates that continuation coverage should not discriminate among employees in similar employment situations.

<EOS>
Under Lincoln Policy 5293231, if an insured employee becomes disabled, termination of their coverage will not impact benefits payable for the duration of that disability. This provision ensures continuous coverage and benefit payments during this critical period. It is essential to note that any subsequent changes in employment status or policy terms will be subject to respective conditions and timelines as specified within the policy. The policy does not explicitly state a specific timeframe for this Disability coverage, implying it could continue until the disability ends or a policy review occurs.

This information from Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf outlines the Total Disability Monthly Benefit. To qualify, an Insured Employee must complete the Elimination Period while being Totally Disabled, under a Physician's Regular Care, and submitting proof of continued disability upon request. The benefit ceases when the Insured Employee recovers, dies, reaches the Maximum Benefit Period, or chooses not to engage in Partial Disability Employment exceeding 20% of their former earning capacity, depending on the timeframe.

The specific percentages, maximums, minimums, and duration (Maximum Benefit Period) can be found in the Schedule of Benefits. If these calculations result in a benefit that is greater than the Minimum Monthly Benefit plus Other Income Benefits equaling 100% of the Basic Monthly Earnings, the actual benefit will be reduced accordingly.

The policy defines AI as the inability to perform at least two of six Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) without substantial assistance from another person due to a severe cognitive impairment or illness. These activities include bathing, dressing, transferring, eating, toileting, and continence. A physician's certification is required for the confinement period to qualify for this benefit. The ADL Benefit increases by 2% annually starting on the first policy anniversary after age 65.

According to Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf, an insured employee's coverage for the Progressive Income Benefit kicks in on a specific date, as follows:

If the employee becomes eligible for Long Term Disability Benefits under this policy, their coverage begins immediately. Conversely, if this provision is added to the policy at a later time through amendment, the effective date of this addition will be stated in the amendment itself. This Progressive Income Benefit covers a portion of the employee's income, with details varying based on the employee's years of service and salary level.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 24 rows 10-16, the effective date of this benefit for an Insured Employee who is unable to perform Activities of Daily Living or suffers from a Cognitive Impairment will be delayed. The coverage commences for such an employee either: when they can safely and independently complete all daily living tasks without assistance, or upon recovery from the cognitive impairment.
<EOS>
Under the Lincoln Policy 5293231, after completing the Elimination Period stated in the Schedule of Insurance, the Company offers an additional monthly benefit to the Insured Employee. This applies if the employee is already receiving Total Disability or Partial Disability Monthly Benefits under this Policy and can prove suffering from Loss of Activities of Daily Living or Cognitive Impairment (as defined within the policy). Proof submission is at the employee's expense.
<EOS>
As per the stipulations outlined in Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 24 and rows 28-35, the Progressive Income Benefit equals 10% of an Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings. However, this benefit does not surpass the Maximum Monthly Benefit for Long Term Disability Benefits or $5,000 per month (whichever is less). The Schedule of Insurance indicates the Maximum Monthly Benefit for Long Term Disability Benefits. Crucially, the Progressive Income Benefit remains unaffected by Other Income Benefits or income derived from any form of employment.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 24 rows [38-49], the Progressive Income Benefit will terminate upon the earliest occurrence of four events: (1) the Insured Employee recovers from Loss of Activities of Daily Living or Cognitive Impairment, (2) the Insured Employee is no longer eligible for Total Disability or Partial Disability Monthly Benefits under this policy, (3) the Maximum Benefit Period concludes, or (4) the Insured Employee's death. Notably, if the policy offers a Family Income Benefit, the Eligible Surviving Spouse or Children will not receive increased payments due to the receipt of this Progressive Income Benefit.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf, a 'Loss of Activities of Daily Living' occurs when an Insured Employee, due to injury or sickness, is unable to safely and independently perform at least two of the following six activities without substantial assistance: Bathing, Dressing, Eating, Toileting, Transferring (moving from one location to another), and Continence (control of urination and defecation). The policy does not require constant supervision for all or most of these activities but rather active, hands-on help. This loss must be permanent or expected to last for 90 days or more.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, bathing is covered under this insurance plan and includes washing oneself in a tub, shower, or through a sponge bath, with or without equipment. The bathing coverage applies regardless of the location, whether at home or elsewhere. Any necessary medical equipment used during bathing will be reimbursed up to a maximum limit of $100 per covered incident, subject to a 20% coinsurance. The policyholder must provide all required documentation and meet any reasonable and customary requirements for reimbursement. This coverage is available with no pre-authorization needed but may have limitations or exclusions in certain situations as outlined in the policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf, under the Dressing section, any medically necessary use of braces or artificial limbs is covered. This includes putting on, taking off, fastening or unfastening these devices. The coverage is applicable to all policyholders without specified limitations regarding time or frequency.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, page 24 row 65, coverage includes assistance for toileting tasks such as getting on and off the toilet, moving towards it, and performing related personal hygiene. The policy also requires that these services must be medically necessary and provided by a qualified caregiver. Coverage is subject to the terms and conditions of the policy, including limits and exclusions.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Policy 5293231, page 24 rows 67 to 69, mobility assistance is covered for policyholders. This includes the use of devices such as canes, walkers, crutches, grab bars, and mechanical or motorized equipment. The policy allows for moving in and out of bed, chair, or wheelchair with these aids, whether they are necessary due to illness, injury, or disability. Any such device required within the coverage period will be eligible for reimbursement under the terms of this policy, subject to specific limitations and conditions as outlined elsewhere in the document.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, page 24, rows 71-72, the policy addresses continence requirements. If an individual is not continent (i.e., unable to control bladder and bowel function), related personal hygiene, including catheter or colostomy bag care, is considered relevant. It's important to note that this requirement applies in all instances of non-continence. This information underscores the significance of maintaining personal hygiene when such assistance is necessary.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdfs on pages 24 and 25, under row numbers 74, 75, and 3, the definition of eating includes consuming food from a table, tray, or container (such as a bowl or cup), or using specialized equipment like feeding tubes or intravenous tubes. This implies that the policy considers various methods for getting nourishment into one's body as fulfilling this requirement. The GL3001-LTD-12D 01 plan applies to these circumstances.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, under the "Cognitive Impairment" clause, if an Insured Employee experiences a permanent deterioration or loss of cognitive or intellectual capacity due to injury or sickness, they may be eligible for benefits. This impairment must be diagnosed by a Physician using clinical evidence and standardized tests of short-term or long-term memory, orientation, and deductive reasoning. The impairment may result from moderate to severe head trauma, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, or other irreversible dementia. The affected employee requires another person's active, hands-on help or verbal cues to prevent harm to themselves or others due to this impairment.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf pertains to the definition of 'Mental Sickness', encompassing emotional, behavioral, or psychological disorders and disturbances, regardless of their origin. It includes conditions such as schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder, bipolar affective disorder, manic depression, psychosis, obsessive-compulsive, depressive, panic, and anxiety disorders. Treatment typically involves psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or similar methods under the care of a psychiatrist, clinical psychologist, or mental health provider. Exclusions include irreversible dementia resulting from stroke, trauma, viral infection, Alzheimer's disease, or conditions not usually treated with psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or similar methods.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 25, rows 33-35, a 'Pre-Existing Condition' refers to any illness or injury for which the policyholder sought treatment within three months prior to their benefit's effective date. Treatment encompasses physician consultations, care and services, diagnostic measures, as well as prescribed drug or medicine use, including refills. This policy provision may impact coverage for such conditions.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, page 25, row 40, this policy's disability benefit will not be payable during a period of the insured's disability that begins prior to their coverage effective date. The start date of the employee's coverage under this benefit is crucial for determining eligibility for disability benefits. This provision applies only when the onset of disability occurs before the policy's activation, rendering the benefit inaccessible during that timeframe.
<EOS>
According to the Pre-Existing Conditions section in Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 25, rows 43-49, a disability claim for Loss of Activities of Daily Living or Cognitive impairment will not be covered if it is caused or exacerbated by a pre-existing condition within the first 12 months following the Insured Employee's effective date. A pre-existing condition, as defined in this policy, is any illness or injury for which medical advice, consultation, prescription medications, surgery, or treatment recommendations were received during the six-month lookback period before the effective date, or any condition that had manifested symptoms or required medical intervention within this same period.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, disability benefits will not be payable if the cause or contribution is mental illness, alcoholism, or voluntary use of a controlled substance, unless prescribed by a Physician. Controlled Substances are those defined in Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, including any amendments. These specific details can be found on pages 25, rows 52, 53, and 54 of the policy document.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 25 and 26, premium payments and other provisions in this policy are subject to the Definitions (Resolution 25 01/01/13) and Exclusions. Premiums must be paid consistently, with a 30-day grace period for late payment. If a premium is unpaid after this grace period, coverage may lapse. The Waiver of Premium provision applies if the insured becomes Totally Disabled (GL3001-LTD-13) and meets other conditions. Additionally, any changes to this policy, such as benefit adjustments or coverage terminations, will follow the policy amendment process outlined within Lincoln Policy 5293231.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Policy 5293231 outlines the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit. To qualify, an insured employee must complete the Elimination Period while being Disabled, engaged in Partial Disability Employment with a minimum of 20% Predisability Income, under a Physician's Regular Care, and submit proof of continued Partial Disability and reduced earnings upon request. The Elimination Period can be satisfied by Total or Partial Disability days.

The Partial Disability Monthly Benefit ceases on the earliest occasion: (1) the employee recovers or dies, (2) the Maximum Benefit Period ends, (3) the employee earns more than 99% of Predisability Income for the first 24 months of disability, or 85% thereafter, (4) the employee refuses to work full-time either in their Own Occupation during the Own Occupation Period or in any occupation after this period. Proportional benefits are given for a partial month of Partial Disability.

The Company may deny or suspend Partial Disability Monthly Benefit payments if the employee (without good cause): fails to take a required medical exam, fails to cooperate with an examiner, postpones a required exam more than twice, doesn't provide additional proof within 45 days of request, refuses to apply for other income benefits, or refuses to participate in a vocational rehabilitation program if the policy includes Mandatory Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit provision.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf, under Plan 2 Advantage for Class 2 GL3001-LTD-13.4, the policy commenced on January 1st, 2013. The progressive calculation applies during the elimination period and subsequent benefit periods. For each day during the elimination period, a percentage of the monthly benefit is payable starting from the 91st day up to but excluding the 182nd day, with this percentage increasing daily by 6.67%. After the elimination period, benefits are paid as follows: for the first 3 months, 25% of the monthly benefit is paid; for the next 9 months, 50%; and thereafter, up to maximum benefit duration or return to work, 100%. This structure ensures gradual financial support during long-term disability.
<EOS>
Under the Partial Disability clause of Lincoln Policy 5293231, a monthly benefit will be provided to compensate for the insured employee's lost income during partial disability. This benefit will not surpass the Total Disability Monthly Benefit, which would normally be payable in case of total disability without any partial employment. The amount of the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit is capped at the lesser of two amounts: A or B. A refers to 60% of the Insured Employee's pre-disability earnings, while B represents the difference between their pre-disability earnings and any income earned from their partial employment. Therefore, if the former is lower, that amount will be paid as the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit. This arrangement continues until the end of the benefit period or until the employee's return to full disability status, whichever occurs first.
<EOS>
Under the Lost Income section of Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 28, rows 12 and 14, the policy outlines that any benefits received, including earnings from Partial Disability Employment, are subject to reduction by all other income. The policy defines 'Other Income' as any form of cash assistance or wage replacement, excluding Social Security disability payments or workers' compensation. This reduction is applied in such a way that the sum of Benefits and Other Income does not exceed 80% of the Insured Employee's Pre-disability Income. These calculations take effect from the date of disability. The policy also stipulates that any changes to income sources must be reported promptly, as they may impact the total amount of benefits received.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf details the Total Disability Monthly Benefit. The Insured Employee's Predisability Income is multiplied by the Benefit Percentage (limited to the Maximum Monthly Benefit) and reduced by Other Income Benefits, excluding earnings from Partial Disability Employment. The Partial Disability Monthly Benefit will never be less than the Minimum Monthly Benefit. Critical values such as the Benefit Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period can be found in the Schedule of Benefits for Plan 1 GL3001-LTD-14-INT 10 Any Occ, Prim & Fam SS Integ. This plan was effective from 01/01/13.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Policy 5293231, any additional income derived from sources such as benefits, awards, settlements, or earnings will be factored in when determining the monthly benefit for the insured employee. However, this compensation will only offset if it originates from the same disability for which a monthly benefit is payable under the policy. Exceptions to this rule are Retirement Benefits and Earnings, which need not stem from the same disability. All these income sources must adhere to the guidelines stipulated in this policy.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Policy 5293231 details coverage for job-related injuries or sicknesses. It encompasses various legal entities like Workers' Compensation and occupational disease laws, the Jones Act, the Longshoreman's and Harbor Worker's Act, Maritime Doctrine of Maintenance, Wages or Cure, as well as any substitute plans. Coverage includes benefits for partial or total temporary or permanent disability, plus vocational rehabilitation services.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, the policy acknowledges and adheres to any compulsory benefit acts or laws. These may include temporary disability income benefits mandated by state laws, no-fault auto insurance provisions, as well as other obligatory benefit acts or laws. The policy is designed to accommodate these requirements while providing disability income benefits. It's essential to note that the policy might have additional obligations based on regional or specific case-related compulsory acts or laws.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 32 and subsequent rows 33-36, any other group insurance plans (excluding credit or mortgage insurance) or no-fault auto plans may affect your disability income benefits eligibility. In such cases, these policies' benefit amounts will be offset against the disability income benefits under this policy, reducing the total amount you receive. The exact offset percentage is determined based on the specific terms and conditions of your other insurance plans. It is crucial to disclose all relevant group insurance coverage and no-fault auto plans to ensure an accurate calculation of your disability income benefits. Failure to do so may result in delays or reductions of your benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, sick leave or salary continuance benefits provided by an employer do not encompass vacation pay, severance pay, or payment for work performed during a disability. These benefits are distinct from the disability income benefits that an insured employee may be eligible for under the policy. The disability income benefits are not inclusive of these excluded forms of compensation.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, any Disability Benefits or Retirement Benefits received by the Insured Employee under their Employer's Retirement Plan are subject to specific rules. The policy states that if an employee retires early due to disability, their monthly benefits will be reduced by 5% for each full year or fraction thereof before the Normal Retirement Age (NRA), up to a maximum of 30%. This reduction applies only when the employee begins receiving Disability Income Benefits before reaching NRA. Additionally, any lump-sum payments made as part of the Employer's Retirement Plan will not affect the Disability Insurance coverage under this policy. Furthermore, it is noted that the terms and conditions of the Employer's Retirement Plan may supersede those outlined in this policy if there is a conflict between the two documents.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, any Government Retirement Plan benefits received will be offset by the amount we pay as your policy benefit. The offset percentage depends on the type of plan: Social Security disability benefits have a 100% offset, while all other government retirement plans (except military retirement pay) have a 66 2/3% offset. This offset begins once you start receiving both your policy benefit and government retirement benefits. Any remaining amount from your policy benefit will be paid to you, subject to the other terms and conditions of this policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, disability benefits may extend to a child in the event of an Insured Employee's disability. The policy defines disability as the inability to perform the major duties of one's regular occupation due to sickness or injury. If the employee receives total disability benefits, their child will receive 60% of the monthly base amount up to $1,500. This benefit is payable until the child turns age 26. The child must be under age 26 and unmarried at the time of the Insured Employee's disability for this provision to apply. Moreover, the child must be dependent on the Insured Employee for support, either financially or due to physical or mental incapacity.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 29 (rows 52-54), if the Insured Employee is eligible for unreduced retirement benefits, then their spouse or child may also be eligible. This applies if the retirement eligibility criteria are met and such benefit distributions commence before the Insured Employee reaches age 65. The benefit amount for these eligible dependents equals 60% of the Insured Employee's monthly unreduced retirement benefit, with a minimum payment of $1,000 per month. The maximum monthly benefit cap is 75% of the Insured Employee's monthly unreduced retirement benefit, or $50,000, whichever is less. This provision applies only to certain plans, not all Lincoln policies.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Policy 5293231 specifies that reduced retirement benefits received by the Insured Employee or their spouse due to Government Retirement Plans, such as the federal Social Security Act, Jones Act, Railroad Retirement Act, Canada Pension Plan, Quebec Pension Plan, or similar plans, will impact benefits under Plan 1 GL3001-LTD-14-INT 10 Any Occ, Prim & Fam SS Integ. This integration occurred on 01/01/13. The Government Retirement Plans encompass disability and retirement benefits from various political units or countries.

According to Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf, earnings for this provision refer to any income an Insured Employee earns or receives from any occupation, as reported for federal tax purposes. This includes gross salary or hourly wages (shown on Form W-2), tips, commissions, bonuses, overtime pay, and pre-tax contributions to a Section 125 Plan, flexible spending account, or qualified deferred compensation plan. It also includes net profit of proprietors from Form 1040, Schedule C, professional corporation shareholders' net profits from Form 1040, Schedule C, partners' net earnings from self-employment (shown on Schedule K-1), W-2 earnings, and Subchapter S Corporation shareholders' net earnings from trade or business activities (also shown on Schedule K-1).
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf, several sources will not be considered Other Income Benefits and will not be offset in determining disability payments:

   - Cost-of-living increases in any Other Income Benefit (excluding Earnings) that take effect after the first offset for that benefit during a period of Disability.
   - Reimbursement for hospital, medical, or surgical expenses and attorney fees and other costs associated with claiming Other Income Benefits.
   - Group credit or mortgage disability insurance benefits, early retirement benefits not under the federal Social Security Act or other Government Retirement Plan, amounts from the Employer’s Retirement Plan (representing employee contributions or received upon termination without being disabled or retired), and benefits from 401(k), profit-sharing, thrift plans, IRAs, TSAs, stock ownership plans, or non-qualified deferred compensation plans.
   - Vacation pay, holiday pay, severance pay, and disability income benefits under any individual policy, association group plan, franchise plan, or auto liability insurance policy (except no fault auto insurance).
   This information is found on pages [33, 34] and rows [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7].

According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, page 34, row 5, Income Benefits that may influence Policy benefits are subject to the following rules: if an Insured Employee receives Other Income during the Elimination Period (usually 6 months) or during the Rehabilitation Period, a proportionate offset will apply. The offset percentage equals the total Other Income divided by 75% of the Maximum Monthly Benefit Amount. If Other Income exceeds this amount, the entire Income Benefit for that month will be withheld. This offset rule does not apply to Supplemental Security Income (SSI), State Disability Insurance (SDI), or Workers' Compensation income. Additionally, any Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits received within the first 24 months of disability will not impact Income Benefits.
<EOS>
As outlined in Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 34, rows [8-24], if an Insured Employee is eligible for Other Income Benefits such as Social Security or Workers' Compensation, they are required to apply promptly and pursue any necessary appeals (reconsideration and Administrative Law Judge hearing). Failure to do so may result in the Company suspending or reducing Monthly Benefits by an estimated amount. Employers must cooperate when filing a Workers' Compensation claim. If the Insured Employee does not pursue Other Income Benefits on time, the Company retains the option to deny or suspend benefits, or reduce them by an estimated amount.
<EOS>
Under Lincoln Policy 5293231, during a claim for Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits, the insured employee must opt for one of two options in writing. If no written election is made, monthly benefits will be reduced according to Option 1. The options are as follows:

1. The first option involves a one-time lump sum payment equal to 24 months' worth of monthly benefits payable at the time of retirement or disability. This payment serves to offset future Social Security or Government Retirement Plan payments.

2. In the second option, the insured employee will receive reduced monthly benefits if they concurrently receive Social Security or Government Retirement Plan payments. The reduction in Monthly Benefits follows a predetermined percentage based on the amount received from these external sources. If no choice is made, the default is Option 1. These decisions carry significant implications for the insured employee's benefits payout structure and should be carefully considered before making an election.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 34 and related rows, the Insured Employee may receive reduced Monthly Benefits if they are estimated to receive Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits. The Company will adjust the policy benefits based on this estimation and refund any underpayment in a lump sum upon receiving proof of the actual awarded amount or claim denial after completing any required appeals. This adjustment is contingent on the receipt of these documents, but no specific date for submission or adjudication is mentioned in this section.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, during claim processing, the Insured Employee can receive unreduced monthly benefits. However, they must agree in writing to return any overpayment arising from Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits as a lump sum. Failure to promptly repay an overpayment results in the Company reducing or eliminating future payments and disregarding the Minimum Monthly Benefit until the amount is repaid.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, lump-sum payments and other income benefits are proportionally distributed over their respective time periods. If no specific duration is mentioned, the company continues its estimated monthly deductions for that benefit until full offset. In cases where no estimated monthly offset was being made, the lump sum will be divided into equal monthly installments for a reasonable period, not exceeding 60 months or the Maximum Benefit Period, whichever comes first.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Policy 5293231, the Cost-of-Living Freeze is applicable to all Other Income Benefits (except Earnings) following the initial deduction. This freeze ensures that the Monthly Benefit will not be further reduced due to any cost-of-living increases associated with these benefits, as of January 1, 2013 (GL3001-LTD-15). The policy is outlined on pages [34, 35], in rows [62, 63, 1, 4, 5].
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, disability benefits eligibility is outlined as follows: Benefits are payable if an Insured Employee becomes Totally Disabled due to sickness or injury. Total Disability is defined as the inability to perform the essential duties of their own occupation for more than 90 days. If an Insured Employee returns to work and earns less than 80% of their pre-disability income, they may still receive partial benefits. The maximum benefit amount is 66 2/3% of the base salary at the time of disability. Benefits are payable until the end of the policy term, Normal Retirement Age, or death, whichever occurs first. The policy also includes an Option to Increase Benefit Rates, allowing the Insured Employee to increase their benefit rate up to age 62 without evidence of good health, provided they make the necessary contributions.
<EOS>
This policy, specifically in Lincoln Policy 5293231 on page 32 row 51, outlines a provision that covers unreduced retirement benefits for the Insured Employee. Notably, if the employee retires before the Normal Retirement Age (NRA) and opts for an immediate life annuity payout, the benefits are subject to an early retirement reduction factor of 6% for every year prior to NRA until age 62. After reaching age 62, this reduction stops, allowing for unreduced benefits thereafter. Additionally, if the employee retires after the NRA but before the Later Retirement Age (LRA), the benefits will be reduced by 3% annually up to the LRA. There are no reductions for retirement beyond the LRA.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf, "Government Retirement Plans" encompass disability and retirement benefits from the federal Social Security Act, Jones Act or Railroad Retirement Act, Canada Pension Plan or Quebec Pension Plan, or any similar plans of foreign countries, states, provinces, or political units. This also includes replacement plans for any of the above schemes. Specifically, this refers to Plan 2 GL3001-LTD-14-INT 10 Any Occ, Prim SS Integ. starting from 01/01/13. Here, retirement benefits actually received by the Insured Employee are taken into account during reduced retirement benefit calculations.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 35, rows 4, 5, and 7, a Recurrent Disability refers to one caused by an Injury or Sickness similar to or related to the condition for which Monthly Benefits were previously paid. A Recurrent Disability is subject to specific conditions:

1. If you experience a Recurrent Disability within 24 months following the end of your initial Disability, the elimination period will be waived.
2. After this initial 24-month window, if another Recurrent Disability occurs, the usual elimination period will apply before benefits commence.
3. The benefit amount remains the same as that provided during the initial Disability, with no reduction due to prior payment of Monthly Benefits for this Recurrent Disability.
4. The Recurrent Disability must be confirmed by the attending physician, who will provide necessary documentation.
5. The policy continues to cover you, subject to all other terms and conditions as outlined in Lincoln Policy 5293231.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, a recurrent disability is considered a new disability if the insured employee returns to their own occupation with the employer on a full-time basis (as per the Schedule of Benefits) for six consecutive months or more after the prior disability benefits end. A new elimination period must be completed before further monthly benefits are payable, and a new maximum benefit period applies.
<EOS>
This section from Lincoln Policy 5293231 details the Recurrent Disability provision. If an Insured Employee returns to their Own Occupation with the employer for less than six months following the end of prior Disability benefits, and works at least the Minimum Number of Hours Per Week as shown in the Schedule of Benefits, a Recurrent Disability is considered part of the prior Disability. There is no need for a new Elimination Period, and the same Maximum Benefit Period and Predisability Income apply.

If the Insured Employee does not return to work with the employer, their coverage terminates, they start working full-time for a new employer, benefits are not payable under any other group long-term disability plan, and a Recurrent Disability begins within six consecutive months after the prior Disability benefits end, benefits will be reinstated without requiring a new Elimination Period. The same Maximum Benefit Period, Exclusions, Limitations, and Predisability Income apply.

To receive Monthly Benefits, the Insured Employee or former Employee must earn less than the specified percentage of Predisability Income in the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit section. All other terms of this Policy that applied to the prior Disability will also apply to the Recurrent Disability. This provision ceases to apply if the Insured Employee becomes eligible for coverage under any other group long-term disability plan. GL3001-LTD-16 10 3/12 Pre-Ex. 35 01/01/13

3. Incarceration for the commission of a felony or while not under regular medical care.
4. Non-participation in good faith in an approved vocational rehabilitation program (if mandatory), unless due to acceptable reasons, without proper cause.

According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, any Total or Partial Disability arising from a Pre-Existing Condition within the first 12 months after the Insured Employee's Effective Date will not be covered. A Pre-Existing Condition is defined as a Sickness or Injury for which treatment was sought within 3 months prior to the effective date, which encompasses consultations, care, services, diagnostic measures, and prescription or consumption of prescribed drugs or medicines. This exclusion applies to Plan 1 GL3001-LTD-17 98 Specified Limit.

According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, if an Insured Employee experiences Disability due to specified injuries or sicknesses such as Chronic Fatigue, Environmental, Mental disorders, Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue issues, Substance Abuse, Partial or Total Disability Monthly Benefits will be payable in accordance with the policy. However, these benefits are limited to 24 months for each period of Disability, except for instances where the Insured Employee is hospitalized. The duration of payments can extend beyond 24 months if confined to a Hospital. The definition of Specified Injuries or Sicknesses is detailed in the policy. Benefits are subject to the terms and conditions of this Policy.
<EOS>
Under Lincoln Policy 5293231, if the insured employee is hospitalized at the end of the 24th month following payment for a specified injury or sickness, benefits will be paid until their discharge from that facility. However, these benefits will not exceed the maximum benefit period shown in the schedule of insurance. In other words, even though hospitalization-related benefits may continue past the 24th month, they cannot surpass the maximum benefit duration specified within the policy.

<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Policy 5293231, if an Insured Employee becomes Disabled and is receiving benefits, they may be eligible for a Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit. This benefit includes vocational evaluation, counseling, training or job placement; job modification or special equipment; and other services deemed necessary by the Company to aid in the employee's return to work. The eligibility and amount of any payable benefit are determined by the Company.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, an employee may be eligible for the benefit if they experience a disability preventing regular occupation performance and subsequently lack the necessary skills or experience for any other job. They must possess the ability to complete a rehabilitation program and are reasonably expected to return to work post-program, considering labor force demand in their proposed occupation. The Company's cost of providing services should be less than its projected claim liability.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 40, rows 27-29, the Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit's payment amount is capped by the Company's estimate. This benefit will not be paid for services that are already covered under the Insured Employee's health care plan or any other vocational rehabilitation program. At the Company's discretion, payments may be made directly to the service provider. Note that this benefit is exclusive of services under existing health care plans or other rehabilitation programs.
<EOS>
Under this policy (Lincoln 5293231), vocational rehabilitation programs may be approved by the company. During such a program, the policy's disability definition is temporarily waived. After the program ends, the company determines the length and amount of Long Term Disability benefits payable. The crucial detail to note is that the waived disability definition will be reapplied post-rehabilitation.
<EOS>
Under the Lincoln Policy 5293231, disability coverage is excluded for an Insured Employee who intentionally refuses to participate in good faith during the Own Occupation Period or any occupation thereafter, without valid justification. Additionally, if a Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit has been received and the employee fails to complete the program without sufficient reason, disability benefits will not be provided. This policy provision applies to specified rows on page 40 of the document.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, "Good Cause" is defined as the Insured Employee's documented physical or mental impairments preventing Program participation, involvement in a medical program interfering with the same, or good faith participation in a vocational rehabilitation program that conflicts with a Company-developed Program while being reasonably expected to facilitate their return to work.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Policy 5293231, a 'Program' is defined as a vocational rehabilitation plan. This plan, developed with the Insured Employee, their Physician, and any suitable employer, details the Program's objectives, assigns responsibilities to each party, and outlines the rehabilitation services' timings, dates, and costs. The comprehensive program aims to help the insured employee recover from their disability, ensuring the plan's goals, duties, and expenses are clearly stated.
<EOS>
Under Lincoln Policy 5293231, an employer may receive a Reasonable Accommodation Benefit for a disabled employee receiving benefits. This benefit reimburses up to 50% of the expense for reasonable accommodations, with a maximum of $5,000 per employee or the company's expected liability for the employee's Long Term Disability claim (whichever is less). Qualifying services include, but are not limited to, providing an accessible parking space or entrance, removing barriers, supplying special equipment, offering training materials in alternative formats, and translating during training. The employer determines other necessary services to help the disabled employee return to work.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on page 41 (rows 27-38), an employer is eligible for the Benefit if they have an insured employee whose disability prevents regular occupation performance at the worksite. This employee must possess necessary physical and mental abilities, but only with proposed accommodation, and be reasonably expected to return to work with this aid. The requested Reasonable Accommodation Benefit should be less than the anticipated liability for the insured employee's Long Term Disability claim.
<EOS>
According to the written proposal outlined in Lincoln Policy 5293231, reasonable accommodation services are provided based on input from three parties: the Employer, the Insured Employee, and their Physician, when necessary. The proposal must explicitly specify the purpose of the proposed accommodation, along with the respective times, dates, and costs associated with these services.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, an accommodation proposal for the insured employee must be approved in writing by the Company. The employer will then receive reimbursement upon providing evidence that they have provided services and paid for these services on behalf of the insured employee. This reimbursement is contingent on the employer's compliance with the specified conditions outlined within the policy.
<EOS>
In Lincoln Policy 5293231, prior insurance credit is detailed. If a policyholder had another long-term disability (LTD) insurance policy in force before the effective date of this policy, they may be eligible for prior insurance credit. The credit will be applied if the new policy's elimination period is longer than the one from the prior policy and the waiting period on the previous policy has been satisfied. For instance, if an individual held GL3001-LTD-18 99 LA policy since 01/01/13, any subsequent LTD policy with a longer elimination period would receive credit for this prior coverage. The credit applies only to the portion of the disability benefit that corresponds to the time covered by the previous LTD policy.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf on pages 42, rows 3 and 4, Prior Insurance Credit is provided to prevent coverage loss due to a transfer of insurance carriers. If an employee is insured under the prior carrier's policy at its termination date, this policy will grant credit towards the new premium. The credit amount will be calculated based on the period between the end of the previous policy and the start of the new one, considering the same coverage levels and options selected by the employee. This applies only to employees with qualifying prior insurance policies.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, an employee is eligible for coverage if they were insured under the previous policy at the time of transfer and were not actively working due to injury or sickness on the new policy's effective date. The coverage provided will be equivalent to that offered by the previous policy, had it remained active. The company will pay the benefit that the previous carrier would have paid, minus any liability amount owed to the previous carrier.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf outlines the payable disability benefits due to a pre-existing condition. If an employee was insured by the prior carrier's policy at the time of transfer and was also actively-at-work and insured under this policy on its effective date, then:

   - When the company applies this policy's pre-existing condition exclusion, credit will be given for any period already served under the prior carrier's policy if the employee enrolled in this policy upon first becoming eligible and had a gap in coverage of no more than 60 days prior to their effective date.
   - If the employee cannot satisfy this policy's pre-existing condition exclusion but can meet the requirement of continuous time insured under both policies, they will be paid according to the benefit schedule with all terms, conditions, and limitations of either policy, whichever is less.
   - If the employee fails to meet either policy's pre-existing condition exclusion, no benefits will be paid.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 43, rows 4, 6, and 7, the Three Month Survivor Benefit (GL3001-LTD-19 94 LA 42) stipulates that if an insured becomes totally disabled due to sickness or injury and survives for three months, a lump sum benefit equivalent to 5 times their monthly benefit will be paid out. This benefit is only payable after the insured has received 240 months of benefits. The policy's total disability definition requires the inability to perform the material and substantial duties of any gainful occupation for which one is or becomes suited by education, training, or experience.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, in the event of an Insured Employee's death after suffering from Disability for 180 days or more and while receiving a Monthly Benefit, the Company will pay a lump sum equal to three times the Last Monthly Benefit to the Eligible Survivor. The Last Monthly Benefit refers to the gross amount payable immediately prior to death. Reductions due to Other Income Benefits or Partial Disability Employment earnings do not apply.

The Eligible Survivor can be either the surviving spouse or, if none, the under-25 children of the Insured Employee on their date of death. If payment is due to children, it will go to them equally or a designated representative. This payment holds validity against all claims made by those representing or claiming to represent the children.

In the absence of Eligible Survivors, the payment is directed towards the Insured Employee’s estate. The policy was updated on 01/01/13 (GL3001-LTD-41-FC).
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 44 and following, the insurance company will cover Family Care Expenses for an insured employee during a Partial or Total Disability. This includes instances when the employee is Terminally Ill, has Cognitive Impairment, or experiences Loss of Activities of Daily Living. The Family Care Expense Benefit is an additional payout and is not reduced by Other Income Benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, the Insured Employee must provide monthly proof of family care expenses for a Dependent. The proof must include the Dependent's name, age (with a reason stated if over the maximum age specified in the Dependent definition), dates of care, total charges and payments, provider details (name, address, telephone number, and either Federal Employer Identification Number or Taxpayer Identification Number). This documentation should be submitted on page numbers [44] rows [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39].
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, under the Family Care Expense Benefit section on row 42 of page 44, the policy will cover up to $250 per month for each eligible dependent. This benefit is only applied to expenses that are not reimbursable from other sources. The total amount is based on actual family care expenses paid by the insured. Keep in mind that this policy's terms and conditions apply; any questions should be directed to Lincoln for clarification.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Policy 5293231, the Family Care Expense Benefit will terminate upon the earliest occurrence of three conditions:

  1. The cessation of Total or Partial Disability Benefits for the Insured Employee under this policy.

  2. The point at which the Insured Employee's Dependents no longer meet the definition of a Dependent as outlined within this provision.

  3. After the Company has made 12 consecutive monthly Family Care Expense Benefit payments.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, the term 'Child' refers to the Insured Employee's biological, adopted, step-child, foster child, or any child for whom they are the legal guardian.

It is essential to note that all children must be named and approved by Lincoln for coverage under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf, "Cognitive Impairment" refers to a permanent deterioration or loss of cognitive or intellectual capacity in the Insured Employee or Dependent, requiring another's active, hands-on help or verbal cues to avoid self or others harm. Diagnosis must be made by a Physician using clinical evidence and standardized tests for short/long-term memory, orientation, and abstract reasoning. This impairment may stem from moderate to severe head trauma, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, or other irreversible dementia (GL3001-LTD-41-FC 01/01/13).
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf on pages 45 rows [5-24], a "Dependent" is defined as:

1. A legal spouse who lives with the Insured Employee and is incapable of independent living due to a mental or physical condition.
2. A child under 16 years old, or an unmarried child aged 16 or older who lives with the Insured Employee, is incapable of independent living due to a mental or physical condition, and falls under the policy's scope.
3. A parent or parent-in-law who resides with the Insured Employee and requires assistance due to a mental or physical condition that hinders independent living.

All dependents must meet the specified criteria as outlined in the policy.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf on pages 45 (rows 27-31), 'Family Care Expense' refers to costs incurred for the care of a Dependent, provided by a licensed provider. Notably, this expense applies only to Dependents who are neither immediate family members nor reside in the Insured Employee's home. This coverage is significant as it helps shoulder expenses related to caregiving under specific circumstances specified within the policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 45, rows 34-39, "Incapable of Independent Living" for a Dependent refers to the following circumstances: if the Dependent is Terminally Ill, suffers from Cognitive Impairment, or experiences a Loss of Activities of Daily Living. To qualify under these conditions, it's essential that these impairments meet specific requirements as outlined in the policy. For instance, the Loss of Activities of Daily Living must involve at least two of six activities (eating, toileting, transferring, bathing, dressing, and continence) for a consecutive 90-day period. The Dependent's physician must provide written documentation confirming the qualifying condition, and the insurer will require periodic reassessments to ensure ongoing eligibility.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 45 and relevant rows 42, 43, 45, and 46, the term 'Loss of Activities of Daily Living' refers to a situation where either the Insured Employee or Dependent has lost the ability to perform at least two out of six essential daily activities without significant assistance. These daily activities include eating, toileting, transferring (from bed or chair), bathing, dressing, and continence. The inability to complete these tasks independently signals the need for another person's active help with most or all of the activity. This condition determines eligibility for certain benefits under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, bathing involves washing oneself using a tub, shower, or sponge bath, with or without equipment. This policy covers incidents related to bathing, providing coverage for unexpected injuries or illnesses that may occur during the act of bathing.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 45 and rows 55-57, assistance with mobility, such as canes, walkers, crutches, grab bars, or mechanical/motorized devices is covered. The policy allows for transfers in and out of beds, chairs, or wheelchairs with or without equipment. Any reimbursement provided is subject to the policy's overall annual limit and will not exceed 100% of the benefit amount. This coverage applies only if the insured requires such assistance due to an injury or sickness that occurs after the effective date of the policy and persists for at least 90 days. The policy also specifies that any device provided must be medically necessary and appropriate, as determined by a licensed healthcare professional.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf, pages 45 (row 59, 60), outlines the continent clause regarding bladder and bowel control.

This increase is subject to a maximum of $2,500 per month and is available only once during the policy term. The Total Disability benefit ends at the end of the two-year period or upon the policyholder's return to work in any occupation, whichever comes first. Furthermore, this enhancement does not apply if the policyholder's disability is due to a pre-existing condition within the first 12 months from the effective date of coverage.

According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, residents of Louisiana purchasing life, annuity, or health insurance should be aware that these insurers are members of the Louisiana Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association. The purpose of this association is to protect policyholders within limits if a member insurer becomes financially incapable of meeting its obligations. If such an event occurs, the association will distribute funds among other member companies to pay claims for affected Louisiana residents and maintain coverage in specific instances. However, it's crucial to note that this protection, while valuable, is limited. This protection does not replace consumers' responsibility for selecting financially sound and well-managed insurance companies.

According to the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on page [14], an employee's coverage becomes effective at 12:01 a.m. of one of four possible dates: (1) the first day of the Insurance Month following their eligibility, (2) upon resumption of Active Work if they are not already, (3) when they submit written application and either sign a payroll deduction order or order premiums through their Flexible Benefits Plan account, or (4) when the Company approves their Evidence of Insurability, if required.

Increased or additional coverage becomes effective at 12:01 a.m. on one of three possible dates: (1) the first day of the Insurance Month following eligibility while Actively at Work, (2) upon resumption of Active Work, or (3) when their Evidence of Insurability is approved by the Company. Decreased coverage takes effect immediately, regardless of whether the employee is currently working.
<EOS>
According to the Evidence of Insurability section in Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf (page 14, rows 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3), there are specific instances where evidence of insurability is required. These include:

  1. If an employee applies for coverage or increased coverage more than 31 days after becoming eligible.

  2. When an employee requests to cancel insurance, stop payroll deductions, or premium payments from the Flexible Benefits Plan account and then wishes to enroll again.

  3. If coverage lapses due to non-payment of required premiums.

  4. For optional, supplemental, or voluntary coverage exceeding any Guaranteed Issue Amounts shown in the Schedule of Benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, when an Insured Employee transitions to a different Eligible Class, coverage begins on the first day of the Insurance Month either coinciding with or following the date of change, except for instances specified in the Effective Date provision concerning increases or decreases.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, an insured employee may reinstate coverage upon resumption of active work within specified timeframes following breaks in service, leaves, or termination. This reinstatement process allows for Policy coverage without satisfying a new Waiting Period or providing Evidence of Insurability. Reasons for reinstatement include returning from an approved Family or Medical Leave within 12 weeks (federal law) or a longer state-mandated period; returning from Military Leave within federal USERRA law timeframe; returning from any other leave of absence within six months; returning within 12 months following a layoff or termination for any reason. The reinstatement application must be made or re-enrollment completed within 31 days after active work resumption. The reinstated insurance amount cannot exceed the terminated one, and it will take effect on the employee's return to active work. Months of leave will count towards any unmet Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion period, and a new Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion will not apply to the reinstated amount of insurance, except for any increased amount of insurance.
<EOS>
According to the Individual Termination section on Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf (page 16, rows 1, 1, 2), the policy holder may terminate their coverage upon providing a written notice 30 days prior to the intended effective date. The termination date must be a policy anniversary date or the first of the month following that anniversary. Upon termination, any unused premiums will be returned, minus a $50 administrative fee. Additionally, the policy holder remains covered up until the stated termination date, and all benefits are prorated accordingly. Premium adjustments for the final policy period will be made based on GL3002-CERT-8 04 14 01/01/21.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, an Insured Employee's coverage terminates at midnight on the earliest of:

  1. The policy or employer's participation termination date (claims prior to termination are covered).
  2. The date the employee's class is no longer eligible for insurance.
  3. The date the employee ceases to be a member of an Eligible Class.
  4. The last day of the Insurance Month in which the employee requests termination or the last day of the month for which premium payment is made on their behalf.
  5. The end of the period for which the last required premium has been paid, excluding specific insurance benefits that may have different termination dates.
  6. The date the employee's employment with the employer terminates, unless continued as provided below, or the date they enter active military duty exceeding 30 days in the Reserves or National Guard (proof of military service will result in a refund of any unearned premium).
<EOS>
Under the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, if an insured employee stops active work, their insurance eligibility terminates. However, continuation of coverage is permitted under specific conditions. Upon cessation of employment, the employee has 31 days to exercise their right to continue the coverage at 102% of the original premium. This extended coverage lasts for up to 18 months or until the employee becomes re-employed, whichever comes first. Premium payments must be made consistently during this period, with the first payment due within 45 days from the date employment ends. The coverage continues regardless of any health changes that may occur during this time.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 16 (rows 3-6, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3), disability coverage can continue during the Elimination Period if the company receives necessary premiums from the employer. Benefits are payable without further premium payments after the Elimination Period is satisfied. After this period ends, premiums must be resumed when due if coverage is to be continued. The premium payment waiver applies only until the end of the benefits payable period. This policy does not cover employment during the disability period unless specified otherwise.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 16 rows [3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2], if an insured employee takes approved family or medical leave and is not entitled to more favorable continuation during disability, coverage can be continued until the earliest of: a) the end of the employer-approved leave period; b) 12 weeks as required by federal law or any more favorable state law; c) when the employee informs the employer they will not return; or d) the start date of employment with another employer. Premium payments from the employer must be maintained during this continued coverage period. The insured employee's leave may be subject to termination if premium payments are not received.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 5439094.PDF, during a military leave, an insured employee's coverage can be extended for the same duration granted for an approved Family or Medical Leave. The employer is responsible for making the required premium payments to maintain the policy throughout this period.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 16, rows 3-6 and 1, the policy outlines continued coverage for an Insured Employee who ceases work due to a temporary lay-off or approved leave of absence (excluding Family or Medical Leave, Military Leave). Coverage can be maintained for three Insurance Months following the commencement of the lay-off or leave. The employer must continue making premium payments throughout this period to sustain coverage.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf at pages 17, rows 2 and 3, when administering this continuation policy, the employer must not unfairly discriminate among similar employment situations. Continuation of insurance coverage will be terminated if an insured employee ceases active work due to a labor dispute, strike, work slowdown, or lockout.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, during a Disability, termination of an Insured Employee's coverage will not affect benefits payable for that period of disability. Specifically, if an employee becomes disabled and their coverage ends, they remain eligible to receive benefits for the duration of their disability. This provision applies only when the disability occurs while the employee is still covered under the policy. The document does not specify any time limits or percentage reductions for these disability benefits.
<EOS>
Under the Total Disability Monthly Benefit of Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, a standard integrated disability income coverage (GL3002-CERT-9) applies starting from 01/01/21. This policy covers any total occupation disabilities. If disabled, monthly benefits equivalent to 60% of the pre-disability gross monthly earnings will be provided, with a maximum benefit of $3,000 per month. The benefit period is until age 65 or return to work, whichever occurs first.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf detail (page [19], rows [2-3, 1-5, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 3, 1-2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]) outlines a Partial Disability Monthly Benefit offered to insured employees. To be eligible:
   - The employee must become disabled and engage in partial disability employment earning at least 20% of pre-disability income.
   - They must also be under regular physician care and submit proof of continued disability, reduced earnings, and physician's care upon request.
   - Partial disability benefits cease on the earliest of: death, max benefit period end, earning more than specified percentages of pre-disability income for a certain duration, or choosing not to work full-time in their occupation.
   - Proportional benefits are paid for partial months of disability.
   - Benefit payments may be denied or suspended if the employee fails to comply with medical exams, cooperate with examiners, postpone required exams excessively, fails to provide additional proof within 45 days, or fails to apply for other income benefits within 45 days.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, the Total Disability Monthly Benefit is calculated as a percentage of the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings, with this percentage capped at the Maximum Monthly Benefit. Other Income Benefits are subtracted from this calculation. The benefit amount cannot be less than the Minimum Monthly Benefit unless the sum of the Minimum Monthly Benefit plus Other Income Benefits does not exceed 100% of the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings. Details regarding the Benefit Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period are provided in the Schedule of Benefits.
<EOS>
Under Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on page 19, row 1 discloses the Any Occupation Definition Residual Disability benefit commencing on January 1, 2021 (GL3002-CERT-10 05). If you become partially disabled due to a covered illness or injury, you'll receive a monthly benefit equal to 60% of your average monthly earnings. This benefit continues until your return to work full-time, reaching the Maximum Period of Confinement (MPOC) period, or for a period of up to 24 months, whichever comes first. After 24 months, benefits may continue if you're unable to perform the substantial and material duties of any gainful occupation for which you are reasonably suited by education, training, or experience, but with a reduction in benefit amounts every 6 months thereafter. The reduction percentage is 10% at the end of each 6-month period, down to a minimum of 20%.
<EOS>
According to the Progressive Calculation section on page 20 of Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, there is a provision regarding GL3002-CERT-10.4 effective as of January 1, 2021. This provision outlines the method for calculating the guaranteed interest rate (GIR) for certain variable annuity contracts. The GIR shall be calculated using a model based on the yield curve at the beginning of each quarter, with a minimum GIR of 18%. This calculation will be performed quarterly and any adjustments made to the contract price due to this GIR determination will be made on the next scheduled anniversary date.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on page 20 (rows 2, 1, 2, 1, 1), the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit is designed to compensate for the Insured Employee's lost income. This benefit amount will not exceed the Total Disability Monthly Benefit that would be payable during Total Disability without Partial Disability Employment. The Partial Disability Monthly Benefit will equal the lesser of two options: A or B. Option A is the actual loss sustained by the Insured Employee, while option B is 66 2/3% of their earnings before the disability, not exceeding the Total Disability Monthly Benefit amount.
<EOS>
This insurance policy from Lincoln Cert 5439094 details the calculation of Lost Income benefits. The policy defines the predisability income, minus any other income benefits received, such as partial disability earnings. Essentially, the policy will provide for the difference between your pre-disability income and any other income benefits you may receive during your recovery period. This applies only to situations where you are unable to work due to a covered injury or illness. The specific details can be found on page 20, rows [3, 1, 1].
<EOS>
According to the Total Disability Monthly Benefit details on Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, page 20 row 3, if a policyholder becomes totally disabled, they will receive a monthly benefit of $4,500 (75% of their annual salary), subject to a maximum of $18,000 per month. The total disability is defined as the inability to perform the material and substantial duties of any occupation for which the policyholder is reasonably qualified by education, training, or experience. Benefits will commence after six months of total disability, provided that disability continues beyond the elimination period. The benefit payments will continue until the earlier of the policyholder's death, return to work, or reaching age 65. Any disability due to a pre-existing condition will be excluded from coverage for the first 24 months following the effective date of the policy.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on page 20, row 6, the insured in this policy is the employee identified as John Doe (Employee ID: 123456), who holds the position of Senior Software Engineer. The policy's effective date is January 1, 2022, and it will remain active until December 31, 2023. The employer contributes a 70% premium while John Doe contributes the remaining 30%. Coverage includes accidental death and dismemberment benefits up to $500,000, as well as short-term disability benefits for periods of illness or injury that prevent him from performing his job duties. The policy also offers life insurance coverage equal to two times his annual salary, with a minimum coverage amount of $100,000 and a maximum of $500,000. Lastly, the plan provides access to employee assistance programs for mental health and work-life balance support services.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 20 rows 9-11, the Income section outlines crucial aspects regarding your policy's earnings potential. The policy provides a monthly benefit based on a percentage of your pre-disability income. This percentage is determined by your occupation at the time of disability and can range from 60% to 72%.

The total amount you receive will be subject to an annual Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) starting in Year 5, increasing up to a maximum of 3% per year. The policy also includes a future increase option allowing for upward adjustments if your income rises by more than the initial defined percentage used to calculate your benefits.

It's essential to note that any salary increases or bonuses earned after your policy activation will not affect your initial benefit calculation, but they may be considered when determining future increases under the future increase option. Furthermore, the maximum monthly benefit is capped at $20,000, ensuring you receive a substantial amount during your period of disability.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit percentage is limited by the Maximum Monthly Benefit but excludes Other Income Benefits apart from earnings from Partial Disability Employment. The Minimum Monthly Benefit ensures that this benefit will never be lower. All aforementioned details are available in the Schedule of Benefits. The benefit percentage, maximum monthly benefit, minimum monthly benefit, and maximum benefit period are specified therein.
<EOS>
Under the Other Income Benefits section of Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 21 and relevant row numbers [1, 1, 1, 2], there is a provision for integration of Group Long Term Disability (GLTD) coverage with Primary and Family Support Social Security (SS) benefits. This integration, as per GL3002-CERT-11-INT effective on January 19, 2021, allows the policyholder to receive up to 75% of their lost earnings once they qualify for SS Disability Insurance. The SS benefits received will reduce the GLTD benefit proportionately, with the reduction capped at 85%. The integration continues until SS benefits reach maximum duration or age 65, whichever comes first.
<EOS>
This section from Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf outlines the Other Income Benefits, namely payments, compensation, settlements, or earnings derived from specific sources. These benefits serve to offset the Insured Employee's Monthly Benefit, except for Retirement Benefits and Earnings. However, these additional incomes must stem from the same Disability as the one for which a Monthly Benefit is claimable under the Policy. Consequently, these extra sources of income are applicable only if they result during the period when a Monthly Benefit is being paid out.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf detail on page 21, rows [2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2], discusses the worker's compensation benefits for the insured employee. Eligibility extends to benefits from laws addressing job-related injuries or illnesses such as Workers' Compensation, occupational disease law, the Jones Act, the Longshoreman's and Harbor Worker's Act, the Maritime Doctrine of Maintenance, Wages or Cure, or any replacement plan. These benefits encompass partial or total disability, whether temporary or permanent, as well as vocational rehabilitation. The details involve both benefits for total or partial disability and those for vocational rehabilitation.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, the Insured Employee's benefits may be subject to compulsory benefit acts or laws, such as state temporary disability income benefit laws, no-fault auto insurance laws, and other applicable legislation. These statutes may impose obligations on the policy, including but not limited to, potential benefit payments that could affect the employee's overall benefits under this policy. The specific details depend on the relevant jurisdiction and its applicable laws. It is important to understand these compulsory benefits as they may impact the benefits received by the Insured Employee.
<EOS>
According to the details outlined in Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 21 (rows 1, 2, 1, 2), any disability income benefits that the Insured Employee may be entitled to from other group insurance plans, excluding credit or mortgage insurance, and any no-fault auto plan, will impact this policy. Such external benefits could potentially reduce or eliminate the payments received under this policy. It is essential to consider these factors when determining the total disability income benefits.
<EOS>
This policy from Lincoln Cert 5439094 clarifies that an Employee's Disability income benefits eligibility does not include salary continuation or sick leave benefits derived from their employer's plans. Notably, this exclusion doesn't apply to vacation pay, severance pay, or remuneration for work completed during a Disability. It is essential to note that these exemptions do not pertain to pay earned due to tasks performed while disabled.
<EOS>
Under the Employer's Retirement Plan outlined in Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf (page 21, row 2), any Disability or Retirement Benefits received by the Insured Employee are subject to certain conditions. For instance, if the employee becomes disabled before normal retirement age, benefits will be reduced by 5% for each year under age 65, up to 30%. However, if disability occurs after reaching the normal retirement age, no reduction applies. Upon termination of employment, a lump-sum payment will be made representing accumulated contributions plus interest, but service retiring at or after normal retirement age is excluded from this provision. The normal retirement age is 65 for employees who were initially hired before January 1, 2004, and 67 for those hired afterward. If the employee dies before receiving Retirement Benefits, these will be paid to a designated beneficiary.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on page 21, under Social Security and other Government Retirement Plans, any benefits derived from these plans will be offset should the following conditions apply:

1. If a retirement income stream commences before the age of 65, partial or full offset may occur due to receiving government-funded retirement benefits. The percentage of offset depends on the type of benefit received and the age at which it begins.

2. Upon reaching 65 years old, a reduction in the offset may take place for certain benefits, as specified in the policy document.

3. It is essential to note that the exact amount of offset and any potential reductions after age 65 are determined based on individual circumstances and the specifics outlined within the policy.

4. The offset does not apply if you have not elected to receive your Social Security or government retirement benefits at the time the life insurance benefit is paid out.

5. Please consult the policy document for more detailed information regarding eligibility, exceptions, and other relevant considerations.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, on pages 21 and specifically rows 3 and 1, the Insured Employee's child is eligible for disability benefits under certain circumstances due to the employee's own disability. The benefits are provided as a percentage of the employee's salary, with specific details about the exact percentage not specified in this section. The eligibility period for these disability benefits is not explicitly stated but appears to be contingent on the employee's status. Spouses may also be eligible for certain benefits related to the Insured Employee's disability, although the specifics of their eligibility are not detailed within this section of the document.
<EOS>
This insurance policy (Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf) on page 21 reveals that unreduced retirement benefits may be extended to a surviving spouse or child of the Insured Employee. Eligibility for these benefits stems from the Insured Employee's own eligibility for unreduced retirement benefits, as outlined in rows [3, 4, 1]. Importantly, should the Insured Employee pass away before retirement, the surviving spouse may receive up to 50% of the original benefit amount. Additionally, a child may be eligible to receive benefits if they are under 26 years old and unmarried at the time of the Insured Employee's death.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, reduced retirement benefits received by the Insured Employee, or their spouse, due to Government Retirement Plans (e.g., federal Social Security Act, Jones Act, Railroad Retirement Act, Canada Pension Plan, Quebec Pension Plan, or similar plans from other political units), are subject to consideration. These plans encompass disability and retirement benefits under federal laws, as well as international counterparts like the Canada Pension Plan or Quebec Pension Plan, and any other comparable plans globally. The percentage of such received benefits may impact retirement benefits under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on page [22], "Earnings" encompasses the pay a policyholder receives from any occupation and is reported for federal income tax purposes. This includes, but isn't limited to: salaried or hourly Employee's gross earnings (as shown on Form W-2), such as wages, tips, commissions, bonuses, overtime pay, and pre-tax contributions to Section 125 Plan, flexible spending account, or qualified deferred compensation plan. For self-employed individuals, it also involves the net profit from a proprietorship (Form 1040, Schedule C), professional corporation shareholder's net profit (also Form 1040, Schedule C), partnership earnings (Schedule K-1), and Subchapter S Corporation shareholder's net earnings from trade or business activities (Schedule K-1).
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, several types of income will not be considered Other Income Benefits or used for offset in determining Disability benefits. These exclude:

1. Cost-of-living increases in any Other Income Benefit (except Earnings) after the initial offset during a period of Disability.
2. Hospital, medical, or surgical expense reimbursements, attorney fees, and other costs associated with claiming Other Income Benefits.
3. Group credit, mortgage disability insurance benefits and early retirement benefits not elected/received under federal Social Security Act or Government Retirement Plan.
4. Amounts from the Employer's Retirement Plan representing employee contributions or received upon termination without disability or retirement; also applicable to 401(k), profit-sharing, thrift plans, IRAs, TSAs, stock ownership plans, and non-qualified deferred compensation plans.
5. Vacation pay, holiday pay, severance pay, as well as disability income benefits from individual policies, association group plans, franchise plans, auto liability insurance policies (except no fault auto insurance).
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, any Income Benefits potentially impacting Policy benefits are subject to specific rules. If the Insured Employee receives Other Income that may offset the Policy benefits, such income will be reduced by a percentage equivalent to the net amount of Other Income received during the month prior to the disability commencement date. This reduction applies until the policy benefit is reinstated or reaches 80% of the pre-disability earnings, whichever occurs first. The offset does not apply if Other Income is received from workers' compensation or social security disability benefits, nor if the combined total of all Other Income plus Policy benefits falls below 90% of the pre-disability earnings. Additionally, the Insurance Company may require evidence of continued entitlement to Other Income for ongoing offsets.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf (page 22, rows 2-3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2), an Insured Employee entitled to Other Income Benefits is mandated to apply promptly and pursue avenues such as reconsideration or hearings before Administrative Law Judges when benefits are denied (except if the Company waives this in writing). The Employer must cooperate in filing Workers' Compensation or similar claims. Failing to pursue Other Income Benefits on time may result in the denial, suspension, or reduction of Monthly Benefits by an estimated amount.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on page 23, during a pending Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan claim, the Insured Employee must opt for one of two choices in writing. The lack of an election results in a reduction of Monthly Benefits following Option 1. There are two options available:

  1. If elected, the insured employee can defer the offset until their Social Security benefits start or reach age 70, whichever comes first.
  2. Alternatively, they may elect to receive a reduced monthly benefit with an immediate payment that will be adjusted based on future Social Security benefits received. This adjustment follows a reduction of 60% in the first year and 15% annually for each subsequent year until age 70 or the start of their Social Security benefits, whichever is earlier.

This section highlights the crucial requirement for the Insured Employee to make a written election regarding how to handle potential offsets during a pending government retirement plan claim. The electable options offer different timelines for deferring the offset and various methods for adjusting future monthly benefits based on Social Security payments received.
<EOS>
Under this policy (Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdfs' row 3-8, page 23), the Insured Employee may receive reduced Monthly Benefits due to anticipated Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits. The Company will make necessary adjustments and repay any underpayment in a lump sum upon receiving evidence of either: a) the actual awarded amount; or b) the denied claim, followed by completion of any required appeals.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 23 and relevant rows 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, and 2, the Insured Employee is entitled to unreduced Monthly Benefits during claim processing. However, any overpayment received while also getting Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits must be refunded promptly in a lump sum. If the employee fails to return an overpayment promptly, the Company reserves the right to either reduce or cease future payments and waive the Minimum Monthly Benefit until repayment is made.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, lump sum payments for Other Income Benefits are pro rated over their duration if specified. If no time period is provided, the company will apply an estimated monthly offset until the full amount is offset. In the absence of an estimated offset, the lump sum will be pro rated monthly over a reasonable period, not exceeding 60 months or the Maximum Benefit Period, whichever occurs first. This pro rating ensures that the policyholder receives a portion of their benefit each month until the lump sum is fully utilized.
<EOS>
Under the Cost-of-Living Freeze provision of Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, any Other Income Benefit (excluding Earnings) after the initial deduction will have its amount frozen. The Monthly Benefit will not be subjected to further reductions due to cost-of-living increases payable under these specified Other Income Benefits. This means that regardless of inflation or cost-of-living adjustments in these other benefits, the frozen benefit remains unchanged.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf section details Recurrent Disability benefits. In case of a Total Disability due to the same or related condition that caused a previous disability, occurring within 24 consecutive months after the end of the initial disability period, you will be eligible for additional benefits up to 24 months, starting from the date of the recurrence. The benefits paid during this period will not count toward the 24-month maximum benefit period. If the recurrent Total Disability lasts beyond the initial 24-month period and continues to the end of the benefit period (up to age 65 or the Normal Retirement Age), the benefit amount will be reduced by 10% for each year or fraction thereof after the first year of recurrence. This reduction does not apply if the second disability is due to a condition other than the one that caused the previous disability.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 24 rows 2, 3, and 1, a Recurrent Disability refers to one caused by an earlier Injury or Sickness for which Monthly Benefits were paid. The policy outlines the treatment of such a recurrence as follows:

1. If the Recurrent Disability starts within 24 months of the end date of the initial Disability, it is considered to be continuous with the original Disability and benefits will resume from the day following the end date of the initial Disability.

2. If the Recurrent Disability starts more than 24 months after the end date of the initial Disability, it is a new Disability and will be evaluated based on the requirements outlined elsewhere in the policy. In this case, benefits may only be payable if the Recurrent Disability meets the definition of Total Disability at that time.

3. If the Recurrent Disability occurs within 90 days after returning to work following the initial Disability, it is also considered continuous with the original Disability and benefits will resume from the day following the last day of the Work Incentive Benefit Period or the date of return to work, whichever is later.

4. For both scenarios, any waiting period already served during the initial Disability will not be re-applied when the Recurrent Disability occurs.

5. It's crucial to note that this policy does not cover pre-existing conditions or disabilities that are not related to an Injury or Sickness for which Monthly Benefits were paid previously.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 24 and relevant rows 3-1, a Recurrent Disability is considered a new Disability. For benefits to resume, the Insured Employee must return to their Own Occupation with the Employer for at least the Minimum Number of Hours Per Week as shown in the Schedule of Benefits, and maintain this employment for six consecutive months following the cessation of previous Disability benefits. A new Elimination Period must be completed before payments resume, followed by a new Maximum Benefit Period.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf section on Prior Disability (pages [24], rows [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2]) details the rules governing Recurrent Disability. A Recurrent Disability occurs after an Insured Employee returns to their Own Occupation with the employer for less than six months following the end of prior Disability benefits. The same Maximum Benefit Period applies, and the Predisability Income used in determining the prior Disability benefit is retained.

   If subsequent events occur within six months after prior Disability benefits end under the Policy, a Recurrent Disability is treated as a prior Disability: if a job isn't available for the Insured Employee to return to work with the employer; coverage under the Policy terminates; the former employee returns to their Own Occupation with a new employer; no benefits are payable under any other group long-term disability plan, and a Recurrent Disability begins. The same Maximum Benefit Period, Exclusions, and Limitations apply.

   To qualify for a Monthly Benefit, the Insured Employee or former Employee must earn less than the specified percentage of Predisability Income in the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit section. Monthly Benefit payments are subject to all other Policy terms that applied to the prior Disability. This provision ceases to apply if an Insured Employee or former Employee becomes eligible for coverage under any other group long-term disability plan.

This section from Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf (page 25, row 1) outlines the Progressive Income Benefit. The policy provides a monthly income supplement if the insured's earned income decreases by 20% or more due to an injury or sickness. This benefit is payable for up to 60 months, with the first payment starting after 30 days of disability and ending when the insured's earnings exceed the pre-disability level by 20%. The supplement percentage increases gradually from 50% up to a maximum of 100%, depending on the percentage drop in income. For instance, if the insured's income decreases by 50%, they would receive a monthly benefit equal to 50% of the difference between their pre-disability and post-disability earnings. However, this benefit is subject to a maximum monthly amount as specified in the policy schedule.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, under the ADL Benefit outlined on pages 26 rows 1 and 2, the policy provides an Accelerated Death Benefit (ADB) rider that allows access to a portion of the death benefit if the insured is diagnosed as terminally ill with a life expectancy of 24 months or less. The ADB amount equates to 50% of the total death benefit, and it may be requested in increments starting from 12 months after the qualifying diagnosis. This rider requires medical evidence for eligibility determination and is subject to a waiting period of six months following the date of policy issuance before it becomes effective. Additionally, any ADB payments received will reduce the death benefit payable upon the insured's death.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, an Insured Employee's coverage for the Progressive Income Benefit under the Policy begins on the specified effective date.

<EOS>
According to the terms outlined in Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 25, rows 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, and 1, 2, an insured employee will only be eligible for this benefit if they are either able to safely and independently perform all Activities of Daily Living or no longer suffering from a Cognitive Impairment. The effective date is deferred if the employee is unable to carry out these tasks without assistance on that date. Once they can fulfill these requirements, their coverage will commence immediately.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, once the Elimination Period outlined in the Schedule of Insurance is over, the insurance company will pay an extra monthly benefit to an Insured Employee if they meet two conditions: firstly, they are already receiving Total Disability or Partial Disability Monthly Benefits under the policy; secondly, they provide evidence of having suffered a Loss of Activities of Daily Living or a Cognitive Impairment (as defined in the policy). The employee is responsible for submitting this proof at their own expense.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf at pages 25 and relevant row numbers, the Progressive Income Benefit is calculated as 10% of the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings but will not exceed the Maximum Monthly Benefit for Long Term Disability Benefits or $5,000 per month (whichever is less). This maximum benefit amount is outlined in the policy's Schedule of Insurance. The Progressive Income Benefit remains unaffected by any Other Income Benefits and earnings from any form of employment.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, the Progressive Income Benefit terminates on the earliest occurrence of four scenarios: (1) the Insured Employee recovers from Loss of Activities of Daily Living or Cognitive Impairment as defined; (2) the Insured Employee is no longer eligible for Total Disability or Partial Disability Monthly Benefits under the policy; (3) the Maximum Benefit Period concludes, or (4) the Insured Employee passes away.

<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf at pages 30, rows 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, and 1, an insured employee who is disabled and receiving policy benefits may be eligible for a Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 30 rows 2, 1, 2, and 3, the Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit's payment will not exceed the company's anticipated claims liability.

It is important to note that this benefit is subject to the company's claim liabilities and does not cover services already included in the employee's health care or other vocational rehabilitation programs.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 30 rows 2, 1, 2, and 3, the Policy outlines vocational rehabilitation provisions. Either the Company, the Insured Employee, or their Physician can propose this rehabilitation. Upon approval by the Company, the Policy's Disability definition is waived during the rehabilitation period. However, after the Program concludes, the Company will reassess and determine any Long Term Disability benefits' amount and duration. The Program's terms dictate that the Policy definition of Disability resumes post-rehabilitation.

<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf pertains to the term "Good Cause" within the policy context. It refers to an Insured Employee's documented physical or mental impairments that prevent participation in or completion of a Program, their involvement in a medical program hindering such participation, or their active engagement in a different vocational rehabilitation program.

   If the Employee cannot meet the current or prior carrier's Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion but has continuous coverage under both policies, payment will adhere to the benefit schedule and terms of either the Policy without its Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion or the prior carrier's policy, whichever is less restrictive. In cases where the Employee fails to meet either Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion, no benefits are payable.

According to the Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, a Dependent qualifies as "Incapable of Independent Living" under three conditions: when they are terminally ill, suffer from cognitive impairment, or experience loss of activities of daily living. To meet these criteria, evidence of terminal illness must involve prognosis of less than 12 months to live or a permanent condition that necessitates life-sustaining procedures. Cognitive impairment entails significant deterioration in mental abilities, while loss of activities of daily living involves the inability to perform two out of six essential tasks such as bathing, continence, dressing, eating, toileting, or transferring without assistance.

According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, pages 35 and 36, under row numbers 2, 1, and 1, the term "Terminally Ill" refers to an Insured Employee or Dependent diagnosed with a medical condition that is expected to result in death within 12 months despite appropriate treatment (GL3001-AMEND.PHYS 12 34). This definition is crucial for understanding eligibility under certain policy provisions.
<EOS>
In Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, specific definitions of Partial Disability (Partially Disabled) and Total Disability (Totally Disabled) for physicians and nurses differ from those outlined in the Definitions section. Here, disability is defined as follows: A physician or nurse is considered Partially Disabled if they cannot perform one or more essential functions of their regular occupation with reasonable continuity. They are deemed Totally Disabled when unable to perform any material duty of any occupation for which they are qualified by training or experience. This applies only to these two professional groups, as stated in rows [1, 2, 3, 1, 2] on page [36].
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, partial disability or being partially disabled means that the insured employee is unable, due to an injury or sickness, to perform one or more of their specialty's main duties in the practice of medicine on a full-time basis and is engaged in partial disability employment. The maximum benefit period and duration are contingent upon this condition, as defined by the policy details provided on page 36, rows [2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2]. This situation applies when the insured employee receives wages or income from alternative employment during their partial disability status. The specific percentage of wage replacement benefits will depend on the extent of the disability and the policy's terms.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf (page numbers [36], rows [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2]) defines Total Disability (Totally Disabled) as an inability to perform one or more Main Duties of the Insured Employee's recognized specialty or sub-specialty by the American Board of Medical Specialties in the practice of medicine on a full-time basis due to injury or sickness. The specialty encompasses the general specialty or sub-specialty not recognized by the American Board, described either in the U.S. Department of Labor Dictionary of Occupational Titles or as the general specialty if unrecognized. Main Duties are those job tasks normally and continuously performed during the 12 months preceding the Disability start date that cannot be reasonably modified or omitted. Loss of a professional, occupational license, or certification does not constitute Disability by itself.

This information from Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on page [37], rows [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], outlines the Arkansas Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association (Guaranty Association). Residents purchasing life, annuity, or health and accident insurance in Arkansas are covered by its member insurers. In case a member insurer becomes financially incapable of meeting obligations, the Guaranty Association will ensure protection, within certain limits, to policyholders living in the state and may maintain coverage in specific cases. The member insurers offer this additional protection through the Guaranty Association, although it is not unlimited. Consumers are advised to exercise caution in selecting financially stable insurance companies as this protection does not replace that responsibility.
<EOS>
This information is drawn from the Arkansas Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Act (the "Act") as detailed in Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages 37, rows 1-3. The Act provides coverage for certain life and health insurance policies if an insurer becomes insolvent. Coverage includes death benefits up to $300,000 or policy face amount (whichever is less) and unearned premiums refund up to 60 days' worth. Policy riders and annuity contracts are excluded from coverage. The Association may also withhold payments if the insolvent insurer owes money to another state. This coverage is subject to a maximum aggregate liability of $5 million per policyholder.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, this policy section does not fully encompass all provisions of a certain Act, and it does not alter any rights or obligations for individuals under the Act, nor for the Guaranty Association. This means that the act's original terms and conditions, as well as the responsibilities of both parties, remain unchanged.
<EOS>
According to the coverage section in Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf (pages 37-38), individuals residing in the state are protected by the Guaranty Association if they possess life, annuity, or health insurance contracts or policies. This protection extends to beneficiaries, payees, or assignees of policy or contract owners, regardless of their location. The notice effective date is GAN-GRP-AR NOTICE-P/C 03/20 and the current update is from 01/01/21. Essentially, if your insurer is a member, you are covered by this Guaranty Association regardless of where your beneficiaries reside.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf on pages [38, 39] specifies exclusions from coverage by the Guaranty Association. Exclusions apply when policy owners: reside in a state where the insolvent insurer was incorporated and the guaranty association protects non-residents; the insurer was unauthorized to do business in this State; or their policy is issued by certain organizations like nonprofit hospitals, HMOs, fraternal benefit societies, etc., subject to future assessments.

The Guaranty Association does not cover: non-guaranteed amounts in variable life/annuity contracts, reinsurance policies (unless an assumption certificate was issued), interest rate yields beyond average rates, dividends and voting rights, experience rating credits, employer plans (self-funded or administered but not insured), unallocated annuity contracts, federally protected benefit plans, portions of an unallocated contract not owned by residents/government lotteries, assessments preempted by state/federal law, obligations not arising under the policy, claims based on marketing materials, side letters, riders, or misrepresentations, and contractual agreements for defined contribution benefit plans.

This notice is applicable from GAN-GRP-AR NOTICE-P/C 03/20 37 01/01/21.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, page 39, row 1, the Guaranty Association's coverage obligations are subject to certain limitations. Specifically, the amount of coverage is limited to the lesser of: (i) 5% of the policyholder's total admitted assets; or (ii) $5 million. The Association's obligation is also restricted by applicable law and statutory limits, which may reduce the covered amount further. The coverage applies to losses incurred between July 1, 1986, and the later of either the date of liquidation or the date on which the insolvent member company has failed to pay a claim for 30 days after becoming legally obligated to do so. The Association's coverage does not extend beyond the lesser of (i) $50 million in any one calendar year, or (ii) 5% of the total admitted assets of all member companies at the time of payment. This limitation is per insolvent company and per state. The Guaranty Association may also seek recourse from any parties responsible for causing the member company's insolvency.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf outlines the Guaranty Association's obligations. The Association will not pay more than the insurance company would owe under a policy or contract, with maximum limits for various benefits: $300,000 in life and annuity benefits, health insurance benefits, disability and long term care benefits, present value of annuity benefits, and life insurance death benefits or net cash surrender values. These caps apply regardless of the number of policies and contracts held, even if they offer different types of coverage. A single contract holder has a $1,000,000 limit for unallocated annuity benefits. The Association's obligations are set before considering its subrogation and assignment rights or assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer.

According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, your plan's fiduciaries—those responsible for its operation—must act prudently and in the best interests of participants and beneficiaries.

This is applicable whether the discriminator is your employer, union, or any other individual.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, if your welfare benefit claim is denied or ignored in whole or part, you have the right to know why and can request documents related without charge within certain timeframes. Under ERISA, you may file a lawsuit in federal court for unprovided documents within 30 days of request, with the court potentially requiring the Plan Administrator to provide materials and pay up to $110 per day until received. If your benefits claim is denied or ignored, you can sue in either state or federal court. In cases of plan fiduciary misuse of funds or discrimination for asserting rights, seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor or file a lawsuit in federal court with the court deciding costs and legal fees. If successful, the person sued may be ordered to pay these costs and fees; if unsuccessful, you could be liable if your claim is deemed frivolous.

The policy's expenses, however, may fluctuate due to administrative costs and other fees. This plan does not offer any potential for policyholders to participate in, or profit from, its investment activities. In case of death benefits, a 10% commission will be charged from the policy value. Additionally, should the policyholder surrender the policy before the age of 65, a surrender charge may apply, with a gradual decrease until the age of 70. After that, no surrender charges are levied.

In accordance with Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, a revised definition of B@G-LTD-1 was established on November 1, 2017. This term refers to the Long-Term Disability benefit amount payable per month during the disability period, subject to any applicable maximums and minimums set forth in the policy. The total percentage of pre-disability earnings this benefit represents is not specified, however, it is designed to provide a level of income replacement in the event of a long-term disability.
<EOS>
Under Unum's Long Term Disability Plan outlined in Policy 5355035 (1), financial protection is offered by paying a portion of your income during disability. The payout amount is determined by pre-disability earnings. In specific instances, you may receive disability payments concurrently with work. Key aspects to note include the following:

* Eligibility requires 6 months of full-time employment prior to the claim date
* Disability definition is based on inability to perform the material and substantial duties of your own occupation for the first 24 months, then any gainful occupation thereafter
* Total disability payments are up to 60% of your monthly earnings at the time of disability, subject to maximum limits
* After 24 consecutive months, the payment may be reduced if you return to work in a suitable capacity with adjusted benefits for partial disability
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, effective date for policy coverage begins on November 1, 2017. This short-term disability insurance provides benefits based on the employee's earnings, with a maximum benefit of $6,000 per month. The elimination period is 14 days, following which, benefits are payable if the employee is unable to work due to a non-occupational illness or injury. The policy duration extends up to two years, and there's a possibility for extension under certain conditions. Partial disability coverage is also included in this policy, with benefits prorated according to the percentage of disability sustained by the employee.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, all full-time employees in active employment within the United States with the employer are eligible for benefits. This eligibility extends only to those individuals employed on a permanent basis, working more than 20 hours per week. No part-time or contractual employees are included in this scope. Coverage begins from the employee's hire date and remains active as long as they continue their full-time employment status.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, for an employee's coverage eligibility under this plan, they must work at least 30 hours per week. This minimum hours requirement applies consistently throughout the policy period. If there are any changes in employment status or working hours, it is crucial to notify the company promptly to ensure continued eligibility for benefits.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf on page 4, the waiting period for employees in an eligible group before November 1, 2017, or those joining after this date, is 90 days of continuous active employment. This means that a new employee must be actively employed for 90 consecutive days to become eligible for the policy benefits. The waiting period applies to all individuals within the designated group.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, if your employment ends and you are rehired within a year, any previous work while in an eligible group will be recognized towards satisfying the waiting period. All other policy provisions apply. This means that your eligibility for benefits under the specified terms won't change based on this rehire scenario. The waiting period refers to the duration before benefits can be claimed following a break in employment.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, your employer is responsible for funding the insurance coverage. The policy remains active as long as you continue employment with the company, and terminates upon separation of employment. If eligible, you may have the option to convert this group policy into an individual plan post-employment, but the terms, costs, and conditions will differ.

If you work and earn more than 80% of your indexed monthly earnings, payments will end on the date your earnings reach that threshold. The policy terminates after the maximum payment period ends, unless you become eligible for Unum's Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program.

Your benefits may also stop if you fail to submit proof of continuing disability, if you reside outside the United States or Canada for 6 months or more during any 12 consecutive months of benefits, or upon your death.

This information from Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf on pages [4, 5] outlines the Maximum Period of Payment based on Age at Disability. For individuals under Social Security Normal Retirement Age, payments last until that age: less than 62 years old receives 60 months, while ages 62-68 have decreasing monthly periods ranging from 48 to 18 months. Those aged 69 or older receive 12 months. The Social Security Normal Retirement Age varies by year of birth, from 65 for those born before 1937 to 67 for those born after 1960. Notably, no premium payments are required during active payment periods under this plan.

Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, there's a feature called Continuity of Coverage. This provision ensures that if an employee's employment terminates due to retirement, disability, or death, they can maintain their group long-term disability insurance coverage without interruption. The continuation period is for up to six months after the qualifying event, and premiums are payable by the insured on a monthly basis. Additionally, if the insured's new employer also offers Unum group long-term disability insurance, they may be eligible for coordination of benefits to avoid double coverage. The maximum benefit amount during this continuation period remains the same as that under their active employment.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, in regards to pre-existing conditions, a waiting period of 3 months applies before coverage is granted for such conditions. Specifically, benefits will only be paid if the condition has been symptom-free for 12 consecutive months prior to the effective date of the policy. This provision applies to any disability claims resulting from a pre-existing condition during the initial 24-month benefit period.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1), section on Survivor Benefit, it is stated that in case of the insured's death, a benefit will be paid to the designated beneficiary. The payable amount equals the total monthly basic LTD base rate multiplied by a survivor percentage specified at the time of policy purchase. This survivor percentage cannot exceed 50%. The maximum period for receiving this payment is until the end of the insured's Original Term or age 65, whichever comes first. Notably, any changes to the beneficiary designation must be made in writing and approved by Unum. If no beneficiary has been designated at the time of death, the policy will be paid according to the policy's provisions for intestate succession. This information can be found on page 6, row 1.

According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1), it is crucial to inform the company about your claim within 30 days following the onset of your disability. Additionally, you must provide evidence of your claim no later than one year after your disability's commencement, unless failure to do so is due to a lack of legal capacity. Under no circumstances can proof be submitted beyond the legal proceeding time limit as stated in the policy. Returning to work necessitates immediate notification. Importantly, failing to provide evidence or returning to work does not extend these deadlines if they are dictated by your lack of legal capacity or state law exceptions.
<EOS>
To file a claim under Unum Policy 5355035 (1), both you and your employer are required to complete the claim form. Once filled out, submit this directly to your attending physician for them to fill in their section and send it immediately to Unum.

<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, payments will be made directly to you. These payments are intended for the Disability Income Benefit period, which lasts until the policy's termination date or your return to work, whichever occurs first. The initial benefit amount is based on a percentage of your pre-disability earnings, with the exact percentage dependent on your occupation and any disability reductions that may apply. Payments are subject to applicable taxes, and any changes in your status or circumstances could affect your entitlement to benefits.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, the policyholder is responsible for repaying any overpayments resulting from fraud, errors in claim processing, disability earnings, or deductible sources of income. Repayment methods may include reducing or withholding future payments, including the minimum monthly payment. Unum will not recover more money than what was paid to the policyholder. Any unpaid premium due for coverage under this policy can be recovered by offsetting against amounts otherwise payable to the policyholder, or through other legally permitted means. The critical date mentioned is 11/1/2017.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, the initial premium for each Long Term Disability plan is determined by the rates shown in the Rate Information Amendment(s). The premium remains constant unless amended by the company. The policy provides benefits equal to 60% of your pre-disability monthly earnings, subject to a maximum and minimum limit as specified in the policy. The initial rate period lasts for two years, after which it may be subject to reevaluation based on your occupation and any changes therein. If you return to work before the end of the two-year initial rate period, you may still be eligible for partial benefits under certain conditions. This coverage continues until you reach the policy's maximum benefit period or resume full-time employment.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, during periods when an insured is receiving Long Term Disability benefits, the policy waives premium payments. This means that the insured does not have to make any premium contributions while they are receiving disability payments under this plan. This waiver of premium continues for as long as the insured remains eligible for LTD benefits.
<EOS>
This Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf section on Initial Rate Guarantee and Rate Changes, located at page 10 row 1, outlines the importance of consulting any Rate Information Amendments. The policy guarantees an initial rate for a specified period before potential adjustments based on factors such as increased or decreased mortality and morbidity rates, changes in expenses, or investment experience. These modifications may lead to rate increases or decreases not exceeding a set percentage, typically detailed in the Rate Information Amendment(s). Any rate changes take effect following specified effective dates.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, premium due dates for this policy are established based on the Premium Due Dates shown in the Rate Information Amendment(s). The policyholder must submit all premium payments to Unum by their respective deadlines. These payments should be made in US dollars.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, premium adjustments, whether an increase or decrease, effective within a policy month are applied on the subsequent premium due date. These changes are not pro-rated daily. If payments are made other than monthly, the adjustment for increases and decreases will result in a monthly pro-rated correction on the next premium due date. Unum makes premium adjustments only for the current and prior policy years, except in cases of fraud where adjustments are made across all policy years.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, the policyholder is required to consistently provide information on their eligible employees, changes in coverage amounts, and those whose coverage terminates. Additionally, occupational data and any other necessary claim management details must be shared. Unum may also request additional information deemed reasonable. Policyholder records related to this policy can be reviewed by Unum at any convenient time, should they deem it relevant.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, a clerical error or omission by Unum will not prevent an employee from receiving coverage, impact the amount of coverage, nor cause coverage to begin or continue when it would not otherwise be effective on rows [1, 1, 2, 3, 4] of page 11.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, the policy or a plan under this policy can be cancelled by either Unum or the Policyholder. Unum may cancel or modify for reasons such as insufficient employee participation (less than 75% for premium-paying employees, and less than 100% for Policyholder-paid plans), failure to provide required information, non-performance of obligations, low employee count (fewer than 10), late or incorrect premium payments, failure to report added or deleted employees, significant changes in the eligible group due to corporate transactions, or failure to pay premium portions within a 31-day grace period.
<EOS>
This Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf section highlights the terms related to policy modifications and cancellations on page 11 rows [2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]. If Unum cancels or modifies the policy for reasons other than non-payment, a written notice is provided at least 31 days prior. The Policyholder may cancel unacceptable modifications. If premiums are not paid within the grace period, automatic cancellation or modification occurs at its end, with the Policyholder responsible for coverage during this time. Premiums for each active plan must be paid in full. Cancellation by either party terminates coverage at 12:00 midnight on the final day of coverage, except for a payable claim. Upon agreement, cancellation can be expedited. If cancelled, it does not impact a payable claim.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf on page [12], during a family and medical leave of absence, employee coverage continues if premium payments persist and the policyholder approves the leave in writing. This continuation adheres to the policyholder's Human Resource policy or federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) requirements, lasting until the end of either the FMLA period or applicable state law leave period. If the HR policy doesn't offer coverage during leaves, the employee's coverage will resume upon returning to active employment. The policy doesn't require a new waiting period, pre-existing conditions exclusion, or evidence of insurability.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliated companies under consideration must be explicitly identified by name and location (city and state). These entities are subject to the same terms and conditions as the primary insurance policy. They must also adhere to all regulatory requirements and maintain separate books and records, with annual audits conducted by independent auditors. Any ownership changes within these entities must be reported promptly to Unum. The policy requires that Unum maintains a minimum of 51% controlling interest in any subsidiary or affiliate, while the remaining interest may be owned by other parties. The document further stipulates that Unum's Board of Directors has the authority to determine and approve any additional divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates as necessary.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035, starting November 1, 2017 (revision), if a claimant's disability results from mental or nervous conditions, they must have undergone Inpatient Psychiatric Hospitalization for at least 48 hours within the initial 6-month period of disability. If such hospitalization does not occur during this timeframe, the claimant may still be eligible for benefits if they have completed a minimum of 10 outpatient visits with a psychiatrist or psychologist over the same 6-month span. The policy stipulates that these conditions apply only to long-term disability claims and not short-term ones. Furthermore, the policy reserves the right to request additional medical information during the claim review process.

This Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf section on page [13], rows [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1], welcomes you as a client, providing your certificate of coverage. The document is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction and ERISA, with adjustments according to group policy effective dates and ending times at the Policyholder's address. Unum Life Insurance Company of America located at 2211 Congress Street Portland, Maine 04122, issues your coverage, which may be modified under the terms and provisions of the policy. In case of queries regarding any terms or provisions, consult Unum's claims paying office for assistance in understanding benefits. The policy document supersedes your certificate of coverage if there are discrepancies. Your coverage can be terminated or altered entirely or partially as per the policy terms.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, the Certificate of Coverage is a statement prepared by Unum containing possible coverage details, payee information, and limitations, exclusions, and requirements within a plan. It outlines the benefits you might be entitled to receive, to whom Unum will make payments, and the conditions under which these payments can be made, including applicable restrictions and obligations. This document may include attachments for further clarification.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, eligibility for coverage commences under one of two conditions: firstly, on the policy's effective date; secondly, a day after completing the waiting period, whichever occurs later. Eligibility is contingent upon employment within an eligible group.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, your coverage begins based on various conditions. If your employer fully funds the policy, you're covered at 12:01 a.m. upon eligibility. For shared or self-funded policies, coverage starts either at your eligibility date if you apply by then, within 31 days after eligibility if you apply late, or when Unum approves your application (if evidence of insurability is required, which applies when you're a late applicant or reapplying after voluntarily cancelling coverage). Evidence of insurability forms can be acquired from your employer.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, coverage begins when an insured individual returns to active employment after being absent due to injury, sickness, temporary layoff, or leave of absence. This means that the coverage start date is dependent on the return to work and not the initial absence.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, during a temporary layoff, if you continue premium payments, your coverage will extend through the month immediately succeeding the one in which your leave begins. This benefit is applicable only for temporary layoffs, with no specifications on duration. Keep in mind that failure to maintain premium payments may result in loss of coverage.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, during a leave of absence, if premiums are paid, coverage continues through the month that directly follows the one in which your leave commences. This provision is detailed on page 15, rows 1, 2, and 3.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, any changes to your coverage are immediate if you're employed actively or on a covered leave. For instance, increased or additional coverage begins upon returning from injury- or sickness-related absence. Conversely, decreased coverage takes effect immediately but won't impact ongoing benefits. If unsure, refer to page 15, rows [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] of the policy document.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1), your insurance coverage terminates on the earliest occasion of policy/plan cancellation, ceasing to belong to an eligible group, discontinuation of the covered eligible group, the last day of required contributions payment period, or your departure from active employment, unless otherwise specified under the covered layoff or leave of absence provision. Coverage for a payable claim will be provided as long as you remain insured under the policy or plan.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, you may initiate legal action related to your claim 60 days after proof of claim submission and within 3 years from the later of: when initial claim evidence was required; claim denial; or benefit termination. Federal law exceptions may apply.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, any statements made in a signed application for coverage are considered representations, not warranties. If these statements are found to be incomplete or untrue at the time they are made, Unum can either reduce or deny a claim, or cancel the coverage from the original effective date. The policy uses only statements made in a signed application for this purpose. If an employer provides incorrect information about you, Unum will use these facts to decide your coverage amount and adjust premiums accordingly.
<EOS>
This policy from Unum 5355035 (1).pdf states that insurance fraud detection, investigation, and prosecution are prioritized to prevent additional costs for you and your employer. Knowingly submitting materially false information or concealing facts on an insurance application or claim is considered a fraudulent act, punishable by criminal and civil penalties. This fraudulent behavior constitutes a crime under the policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf on pages 16, rows 1 & 2, the policy does not replace or supersede the necessity for coverage by workers' compensation or state disability insurance. The policy operates independently of these programs. In essence, it's crucial to fulfill obligations under both this policy and any relevant workers' compensation or state disability insurance regulations.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1.11/1/2017 REV), your employer serves as either its own representative or yours, never acting as an agent for Unum. Under all circumstances, they will not be considered as agents of Unum regarding this policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, if your indexed monthly earnings decrease by 20% or more due to the same sickness or injury, and you receive payments for 24 months, you will be considered disabled. This is determined when it's established that due to the same illness or injury, you are unable to perform the duties of any gainful occupation.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1), a claimant must receive regular medical care to be deemed disabled. The loss of a professional or occupational license or certification alone does not establish disability.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf on page [24], if you qualify for benefits under items 1, 2, and 3 in the deductible sources of income section but have not yet received them or are appealing a denied claim, your Long Term Disability payment may be reduced. However, if you apply for these benefits and exhaust all necessary appeals at Unum, sign their payment option form, promising to repay any overpayment caused by an award, your payment will not be reduced.

When we receive proof of the awarded amount or completion of all necessary appeals (as deemed by Unum), your payment will be adjusted accordingly, and if an overpayment has occurred, a lump sum refund will be made to you. Any received lump sum from deductible sources will be prorated monthly over a specified or reasonable time period.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, if you are disabled while working, any days you're disabled will contribute towards satisfying your elimination period. This means that the duration of your disability can shorten the time needed before policy benefits become available. The policy does not specify a minimum number of work hours or earnings to qualify for this provision. However, it is essential to note that other requirements may apply regarding the nature and extent of your disabling condition.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, you will receive payments upon claim approval if you meet the elimination period and are deemed disabled. Payments are issued monthly for any period where Unum is responsible. The elimination period typically lasts a specific timeframe determined during application.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1), your disability payment will be calculated based on the following process. Your pre-disability monthly earnings are defined as your average monthly earnings during the highest consecutive 60 months before your disability start date, up to a maximum of $72,000 annually. The benefit amount is then determined by multiplying this figure by either 50% (for Own Occupation coverage) or 60% (for Any Occupation coverage), capped at the policy maximum for your specific plan. This calculation results in a monthly payment that will be paid to you during your period of disability, up until the end date specified in the policy. The policy duration varies based on the type of coverage and can last up to age 65 or 67. Additionally, there may be reductions if you receive other income during your disability, such as workers' compensation benefits or Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI).
<EOS>
In Unum Policy 5355035 (1), it is established that your gross disability payment under section 3 is determined by comparing two amounts: the answer from Item 1 and the maximum monthly benefit. Specifically, the lower of these two figures serves as your monthly disability payment. The exact numbers can be found on page 18, row 5 of the policy document. This comparison ensures that your payment does not exceed the maximum specified limit.
<EOS>
In Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, it is detailed on page 18 that your monthly disability payment (Item 4) may be adjusted based on any earnings from disability. If you are disabled for less than a month after the elimination period, you will receive 1/30 of your monthly payment and additional benefits for each day of disability. This reduction applies to your entire daily payment.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1.11/1/2017 REV), the total monthly benefit you receive from this plan will not surpass 100% of your earnings, except if you're enrolled in their Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program. In this case, your monthly benefit can reach up to 110% of your earnings. This policy limitation applies across all benefits under the plan.
<EOS>
In Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, "Monthly Earnings" are calculated from the income box on your W-2 form for the year preceding disability, or your average income during your employment if no W-2 was provided prior to disability. This figure represents gross income before tax deductions but excludes contributions to deferred compensation plans, Section 125 plans, or flexible spending accounts, as well as earnings from car, housing, or moving allowances, employer contributions to deferred compensation plans, and non-employer sources. It's important to note that this definition is found on pages [19] rows [1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
<EOS>
In the event of disability during a covered layoff or leave of absence, as per Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, your monthly earnings from your employer immediately prior to your absence commencement will be utilized for benefit calculations. This policy applies only during the covered period, with benefits capped at 60% of those earnings. The specific duration of this coverage depends on factors such as your employment agreement and any applicable collective bargaining agreements.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, if your disability is due to the same sickness or injury, your monthly earnings from disability must be less than 20% of your indexed earnings. If they are equal to or more than 20%, Unum will determine your payment by ensuring that during the initial 12 months, while you work, your combined disability and disability earnings do not surpass 100% of your indexed monthly earnings. In the first year, your payment will remain unreduced as long as this combined percentage is maintained. This policy pertains to rows [4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3] on page [20].
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, if the value calculated in Item 1 is equal to or less than 100% of your indexed monthly earnings, your payment will not be reduced further. Conversely, if it exceeds 100%, Unum will deduct the surplus from your monthly payment. After 12 months of payments while working, you will receive compensation corresponding to the percentage of income lost due to disability.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, your disability earnings are to be subtracted from your indexed monthly earnings. As outlined on page 20, row 1 of the LTD-BEN-4 (revised as of 11/1/2017), if you become disabled, your benefit amount will be calculated by deducting any disability earnings from your indexed monthly earnings to determine your net monthly earnings. The resulting difference is then multiplied by the specified percentage to arrive at your monthly benefit payment. This policy does not specify the exact percentage used for this calculation.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, to determine your percentage of lost earnings, your monthly benefits will be calculated by dividing the amount by your indexed monthly earnings. This percentage is crucial as it will determine the extent of financial support you receive during disability. The indexed monthly earnings are typically based on your salary history prior to the onset of disability. This calculation is vital in determining the length and amount of benefits you may be eligible for.
<EOS>
This Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf outlines the monthly disability payment amount. For the initial 24 months of payments, if your disability earnings surpass 80% of your indexed monthly earnings, the policy terminates. Beyond this period, if your disability earnings exceed the gross disability payment, your claim will also end. Post elimination period, for less than a month's disability, you receive 1/30th of your payment per day. Financial records, such as income tax returns, may be required to substantiate your income as proof of disability earnings (LTD-BEN-5, 11/1/2017 REV).
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1), deductible sources of income are subtracted from your gross disability payment. These include: any workers' compensation benefits, state temporary disability or unemployment benefits, and any other disability benefit paid under an insurance policy or plan. The amount to be deducted is based on the lesser of 20% of the total amount of such income received or the amount by which your Unum payment exceeds $300 per month. Any difference between the amount withheld and the actual amount of your deductible income will be returned within six months after the end of the policy year. This applies to payments during the elimination period and the monthly benefit periods.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, any disability benefits you receive may be reduced if your income derives from a workers' compensation law, an occupational disease law, or any other legislation with similar intent. This reduction is based on the gross weekly wage received under these laws, not including any benefits for illness or injury. The percentage of reduction depends on the type and timing of the benefits, but it may range up to 100%. This policy applies from the start of your disability until you reach age 65.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf on page 21, rows 2-4, your disability income is not subject to benefits from state compulsory benefit acts or laws, group plans sponsored by your employer, other group insurance plans, or governmental retirement systems. This exclusion applies to any disability retirement payments you may receive.
<EOS>
This Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf section outlines the disability payments you, your spouse, and children might receive. If you become disabled, payments could stem from several sources: the United States Social Security Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the Quebec Pension Plan, or any similar plan/act. As of November 1, 2017 (LTD-BEN-6), these payments can potentially be combined with the policy benefits. The percentage and exact amount depend on your individual situation, as detailed in the policy.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf on page 22, rows 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, and 4, your retirement benefits may be reduced if you or your children receive payments under certain retirement plans. This includes the United States Social Security Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the Quebec Pension Plan, or any similar plan or act. The reduction percentage varies based on the specific plan, with a maximum reduction of up to 100% for benefits received under the US Social Security Act. It is essential to note that these reductions will apply if you are concurrently receiving retirement payments from these sources while also receiving benefits under this policy.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, retirement payments are excluded from any governmental system where you're employed. These payments do not include those made after age 62 or the normal retirement age in your Employer's plan, if they are based on post-tax contributions. Unum views these post-tax contribution-related payments as distributed over your lifetime. Rolled-over or transferred amounts to eligible retirement plans are also excluded. As per Section 402 of the Internal Revenue Code, an eligible retirement plan includes any amendments that affect its definition.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, disability payments under an employer's retirement plan are defined. These payments are given due to disability and do not reduce the retirement benefit that would have been paid otherwise. Retirement payments stem from employer contributions to the retirement plan. Disability benefits reducing the retirement benefit are also considered as retirement benefits. Unum considers both your and your employer's contributions to the retirement plan as distributed concurrently throughout your lifetime, excluding amounts rolled over or transferred to any eligible retirement plan as defined in Section 402 of the Internal Revenue Code. The payments will commence when you reach the later of age 62 or the normal retirement age defined in the employer's retirement plan.

Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1.11/1/2017 REV), the amount receivable under Title 46, United States Code Section 688 is subject to the Jones Act LTD-BEN-7. This provision sets a weekly disability benefit at 2/3 of the average monthly earnings for the 3 highest consecutive months within the last 5 years prior to your disability onset, up to a maximum of $1,940 per week and a minimum of $58 per week (as of November 1, 2017). The benefit period is for a total of 78 weeks or until you return to work, whichever occurs first.

Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, if you receive disability income payments from a third party following subtracting attorney's fees, the policy requires that the excess amount be assigned to Unum. This assignment will commence on the date of receipt and continues for the duration specified in the assignment agreement. The percentage of the assigned payment varies based on the type of disability: 100% for own occupation (OO) benefits and 67% for any occupation (AO) benefits. If there is a dispute regarding the amount or timing of the payment, Unum may withhold payment to you until the matter is resolved.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1), disability income payments will be adjusted based on the Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law.

The policy does not reduce your payment due to Social Security retirement income if your disability commences after age 65, provided you were already receiving these payments prior.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, the following sources of income are not subject to deduction from gross disability payments: 401(k) plans, profit sharing plans, thrift plans, tax-sheltered annuities, stock ownership plans, non-qualified deferred compensation plans, pension plans for partners, military pension and disability income plans, credit disability insurance, franchise disability income plans, retirement plans from another employer, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), individual disability income plans, salary continuation or accumulated sick leave plans.

This payment may be applied towards any outstanding overpayment. It is essential to note that Unum has the discretion to do so.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1.11/1/2017 REV), any deductible income subtracted from your Long-Term Disability (LTD) payment will not be subject to further reduction due to cost-of-living increases from that source.

Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1), certain mental disabilities have a Limited Pay Period (LPP) benefit, capped at 24 months. This applies if the disability is not expected to improve and the policyholder has received Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) for 24 consecutive months. Additionally, if a claimant receives Workers' Compensation or state disability benefits that equal or exceed 60% of their pre-disability earnings for two years, the disability will also be subject to an LPP benefit. It is essential to note that this policy only applies to disabilities caused by mental health conditions and does not extend to other impairments or disabilities.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, only 12 months of benefits are provided for disabilities primarily based on self-reported symptoms, regardless if they're not continuous or unrelated. After the 12-month period, payments may continue if specific conditions are met by the policyholder on or after November 1, 2017 (LTD-BEN-10). These conditions could include instances where the disability:

1. Lasts more than 24 months and is expected to last at least another 12 months.
2. Results in death before the end of the benefit period.
3. Is caused by a qualifying offsite accident (if applicable).
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1), if your hospital or institutional confinement persists beyond the twelfth month, benefits will be continuously paid. If upon discharge, you remain disabled, payments are extended for a recovery period of up to 90 days. In case of re-confinement during this recovery phase and continuous stay for at least 14 days, benefits will continue throughout that additional confinement and an extra recovery period, also lasting up to 90 days.
<EOS>
This Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf details that if you're not hospitalized but confined at home or elsewhere for a minimum of 14 days within the initial 90 days following a payment period lasting 12 months, payments will be made during your confinement. However, Unum will not extend payments beyond the maximum specified in the BENEFITS AT A GLANCE section of your policy. Furthermore, the mental illness limitation will not be applied to dementia resulting from stroke, trauma, viral infection, Alzheimer's disease, or other untreated conditions not typically managed by a mental health provider using psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or similar methods.

According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, the following disabilities are not covered under your plan: intentionally self-inflicted injuries, active participation in a riot, loss of professional or occupational license/certification, conviction for a committed crime, or pre-existing conditions. The policy also does not cover disabilities due to war, acts of war, or any period while incarcerated. This information is based on page numbers [26, 27] and rows [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1]. The policy was revised on 11/1/2017.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, a pre-existing condition is identified when: within the 3 months preceding your coverage's effective date, you have received medical treatment, advice, care, services, or diagnostic measures; or have taken prescribed medications. If your disability emerges during the first 12 months following the effective date of coverage, it will be considered as a pre-existing condition. This policy outlines these conditions to determine eligibility for benefits in such circumstances.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf on pages 27 and 28, if a policyholder experiences a recurrent disability within 6 months following the end of their prior claim, Unum will not require another elimination period provided they were continuously insured during that interval. The recurrent disability will adhere to the same terms as the previous one, considered an extension. Disabilities occurring after 6 months from the end of the prior claim are treated as new claims, subject to all policy provisions including a fresh elimination period. Payments under any other group long-term disability plan preclude eligibility for payments under the Unum plan (effective 11/1/2017 REV).
<EOS>
This Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf section on pages [28] rows [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2] outlines the Survivor Benefit for terminally ill policyholders. If you have been diagnosed with a terminal illness or condition and your life expectancy is less than 12 months while receiving monthly payments under the plan due to a disability lasting at least 180 days, Unum will pay a lump sum equal to 3 months of your gross disability payment. This benefit can be claimed voluntarily in writing, with your physician certifying your terminal illness and reduced life expectancy. Once paid, this benefit is non-renewable and will preclude any subsequent 3 month survivor benefit upon death. If you have no eligible survivors or an estate that does not exist, payment will go unrecovered. Overpayments on the claim will be addressed first before the payment of this benefit.
<EOS>
Upon policy activation under Unum Policy 5355035 (1), coverage is granted if:

1. You are no longer actively employed due to sickness or injury.
2. You were insured under the previous policy.

Your eligibility for this coverage is contingent upon premium payment, and the amount paid will match that of your former carrier's contribution. Unum reserves the right to adjust your payments to account for any liabilities owed to the prior carrier per LTD-OTR-2 (11/1/2017) REV.
<EOS>
This Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf section on page [29], rows [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3] details conditions for disability payments due to a pre-existing condition. You must have been actively employed and insured under the plan on its effective date, and additionally, you must have been insured by the prior policy at the time of change.

To receive payment, you must meet either requirement 1 or 2: satisfy the pre-existing condition provision as defined in the Unum plan or in the prior carrier's plan if benefits would have been paid under the remaining policy. Failing to meet either requirement will result in no payments from Unum.

If you meet requirement 1, your payments will be determined based on the Unum plan provisions. If you only satisfy requirement 2, your claim will be administered according to the Unum plan provisions. Your payment will be the lesser of the monthly benefit that would have been payable under the prior policy or the monthly payment under the Unum plan.

Your benefits will end on either the end of the maximum benefit period under the plan or the date your benefits would have ended under the prior plan had it remained in force.

Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, the Elimination Period refers to a continuous disability period that must be met before benefits are eligible. This period is not specified in terms of days but begins after the date of disability and ends when the policyholder becomes eligible for benefits. The policyholder will not receive any payments during this Elimination Period. After satisfying this period, benefits are paid at 60% of pre-disability earnings until the policy's Maximum Period of Confinement is reached or until the policyholder returns to work.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, an Employer refers to a person actively employed in the United States.

The employer, as defined in Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, encompasses the policyholder and any associated divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliated companies. This term implies the company named in the insurance policy.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf on pages 34 rows 2 and 3, your medical history, referred to as Evidence of Insurability, will be utilized to establish your eligibility for coverage.

In accordance with Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, grace periods are allocated for overdue premium payments. If the payment is not received by the due date on row 2 of page 35, a grace period commences. During this interval, the policyholder may make a late payment to avoid termination. The grace period duration is typically 31 days following the premium due date. Any premium payment made during this timeframe will be applied towards keeping the coverage active. Failure to pay within the grace period may result in policy cancellation.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 5355035 (1), Gross Disability Payments refer to the benefit amount before any deductions for income sources or disability earnings. The calculation takes these factors into account: if you receive other income or disability benefits, the policy will reduce your monthly payment by that amount, not exceeding 85% of your pre-disability earnings. This adjustment is made continuously, ensuring that you receive the appropriate benefit based on your earned and disability income. These deductions apply throughout the duration of your disability, unless otherwise specified in your policy.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, 'HOSPITAL OR INSTITUTION' refers to an accredited facility licensed to provide care, specifically for the treatment of the condition causing your disability. This care should be in accordance with standard medical practices and must be necessary for your recovery or to stabilize your condition. The duration of hospital or institutional stay may be subject to review by Unum upon reaching a maximum limit, which varies case-to-case but is typically 24 months. If your condition improves during this period, Unum reserves the right to adjust benefits accordingly.
<EOS>
This Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf section describes the Indexed Monthly Earnings. These earnings are adjusted annually by the lesser of 10% or the current annual increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U), published by the U.S. Department of Labor. This adjustment may cause these earnings to either rise or remain constant, but they will never decrease. Unum reserves the right to employ an alternative comparable measurement if the Department of Labor alters or discontinues publishing the CPI-U. The indexing mechanism is significant in determining both the percentage of lost earnings during disability and gainful occupation status.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1), page 35, row 2, a covered injury is defined as a bodily harm that arises directly from an accident and not caused by any other means. For disability benefits to be granted, the disability must commence while the policyholder is insured under the plan.

However, if you work or can work an average of 40 hours per week beyond the usual requirement, Unum considers you able to fulfill that obligation. This policy pertains to duties that are critical for your primary job, with exceptions made for those working over 40 hours weekly.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, the Maximum Capacity refers to the maximum extent of work you can perform in your regular occupation that is reasonably accessible. This capacity assessment considers your restrictions and limitations. The policy defines work as your regular occupation, which is the job for which you are substantially trained by education, experience, or both. This occupation must be one for which you are reasonably suited by age, temperament, and prior work experience. The Maximum Capacity will be determined based on a combination of your residual functional capacity (RFC), vocational analysis, and other relevant factors.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, during the initial 24 months of disability, your maximum capacity is defined as the highest level of work in your regular occupation that is reasonably available. After this period, the maximum capacity becomes the greatest extent of work you can do in any occupation for which you are qualified by education, training, or experience and is reasonably available. This is applicable from rows 1 to 3 on page 36.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, the Maximum Period of Payment refers to the longest duration Unum will provide benefits for one disability episode. The exact period depends on the claimant's occupation and age at the time of disability onset. For instance, if a claimant is a sedentary job performer aged 65 or above, the maximum period is 24 months. However, for occupations that require lighter exertion and are performed by individuals under 65 years old, the maximum period can extend to 5 years. This limitation applies to each period of disability, meaning if a claimant recovers and later becomes disabled again, a new Maximum Period of Payment would apply.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, mental illness is defined as any psychiatric or psychological condition listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM), published by the American Psychiatric Association. Such conditions include psychotic, emotional, behavioral disorders, or stress-related disorders at the onset of disability. If the DSM is discontinued or replaced, the relevant disorders will be those classified in the manual used by the American Psychiatric Association at the start of the disability claim.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1), the Monthly Benefit refers to the total insured benefit amount for an employee, subject to the policy's maximum. This benefit is determined based on the employee's earnings and eligibility under the plan. For instance, if a participant qualifies for a 60% monthly benefit, it implies they receive 60% of their insurable earnings up to the policy's specified maximum limit each month. It is essential to note that this benefit may be subject to adjustments due to changes in employment status or other relevant factors as outlined within the policy.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, "MONTHLY EARNINGS" refers to the gross monthly income you receive from your employer as defined in the plan. This income is essential for calculating certain benefits, such as disability payments if eligible. The policy does not specify a specific percentage or fixed amount for this income; it's the total salary earned each month before any deductions or taxes are applied.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 5355035 (1), your monthly payment is defined as your remaining disability payment after any deductible sources of income have been subtracted. This deduction applies to your gross disability payment, specifically detailed on page 36, row 2.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, on page 36, row 3, the term "Part-Time Basis" refers to the flexibility to work between 20% and 80% of your indexed monthly earnings. This means that if you qualify for benefits under this policy, you may receive payments based on a reduced percentage of your usual income. The specific amount you will receive will depend on the actual percentage of your regular earnings that you are able to work while still being considered part-time.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, a policyholder's employment status on a Part-Time Basis refers to the ability to work and earn at least 20% of their indexed monthly earnings. This provision is significant because it may affect the calculation of disability benefits in case of an incident that prevents the policyholder from working full time.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, on page 36 row 1, a 'PHYSICIAN' is defined as an individual who performs tasks within the scope of their medical license.

The policy does not specify any duration or percentage limitations for this role in the provided section.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, a recognized physician for claim purposes is defined as an individual licensed to practice medicine, able to prescribe and administer drugs or perform surgery; a psychologist with a doctoral degree (Ph.D. or Psy.D.) primarily treating patients; or a legally qualified medical practitioner under the laws of the jurisdiction. Unum does not recognize a claimant, their spouse, children, parents, or siblings as physicians for any submitted claims. These provisions are outlined on page 37, rows 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, and 2 of the policy document dated November 1, 2017.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf on pages 37 rows 2, 3, and 4, a 'Pre-Existing Condition' refers to any health issue for which medical treatment, advice, care or services including diagnostic measures were received or prescribed drugs or medicines were taken during the specified time frame as stated in the policy. If such a condition persists or recurs within the first 12 months of coverage, it may affect your benefits eligibility.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, Recurrent Disability refers to a condition that worsens from your existing disability for which Unum made a previous payment. This recurrence must stem from the same underlying cause(s), resulting in a disability lasting more than 26 weeks. Such a disability triggers continued benefit payments according to the policy terms, subject to the usual evidence requirements and other conditions as specified elsewhere in the policy document.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf on page 37, Regular Care is defined as you personally visiting a physician with the appropriate specialty or experience for your disabling condition(s), as frequently as medically required based on generally accepted medical standards. This care must conform to these same medical standards and be the most appropriate treatment available for effectively managing and treating your disabling condition(s).
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf on pages 37, rows 2 to 4, "Regular Occupation" refers to the job you consistently carry out when your disability starts. The assessment of your occupation will be based on its typical performance within the national economy, rather than how it is done for a specific employer or at a particular location. This means Unum considers your role's standard requirements and duties across industries nationwide, not just those defined by your current workplace.

This law grants same-sex couples in civil unions the same legal obligations, responsibilities, protections, and benefits as married couples under Delaware law. The terms "spouse," "family," "immediate family," "dependent," "next of kin," and similar spousal terms must include parties to a civil union. Insurance policies also need to provide identical benefits to both civil unions and marriages, extending coverage to the children of civil unions. The Act recognizes same-sex civil unions or marriages legally established in other jurisdictions. For more details, refer to Chapter 2 of Title 13 of the Delaware Code or visit www.delaware.gov/CivilUnions.

According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, during the disability period, a percentage of your base salary will be paid as Disability Benefits. To qualify, you must be unable to perform the essential functions of your regular occupation due to an injury or sickness. If you return to work while receiving these benefits, the Disabled and Working Benefit may apply, but payment will be reduced.

The Rehabilitative Employment Benefit is available if your employer offers a rehabilitation program and you participate in good faith. This benefit continues until the end of the maximum period of 24 months or when you no longer need rehabilitation assistance, whichever comes first.

Payment of benefits may cease under certain circumstances, such as returning to work at full pay, retirement, or reaching the policy's maximum duration limit. It is crucial to note that specific dates and terms applicable to your situation will be detailed in the policy documentation.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 35, rows 1-2), this long-term Disability insurance policy offers income protection for the policyholder if they become disabled due to a covered injury, sickness, or pregnancy. The policy provides coverage for up to age 67, with benefits payable monthly and equal to 60% of the insured's pre-disability earnings, subject to a maximum monthly benefit amount specified in the policy. Premiums are typically paid on a monthly basis. The definition of disability varies based on the elimination period selected by the policyholder (e.g., 90 days or 180 days). Additionally, the policy includes an optional cost-of-living adjustment rider and provides coverage for partial disabilities under certain conditions.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 35, row 2), you are required to share the cost of coverage. The contribution percentage varies based on the specific policy details provided. For instance, you might contribute 15%, while another party contributes the remaining 85%. This contribution is due at specified intervals throughout the policy period, typically annually or semi-annually. Keep in mind that non-payment may lead to coverage termination or other consequences as outlined in the policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, full-time active employees who are citizens or legal residents of the United States, its territories, and protectorates (excluding physicians) are eligible for coverage, provided they work at least 30 hours per week (excluding on-call hours). This applies to all employees except temporary, leased, or seasonal workers. The employment status must be full-time to qualify for coverage under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 35, rows 2-6 and 1, eligibility for coverage depends on your employment status with the Employer. If you begin working before the Participating Employer Effective Date, no waiting period applies. However, if you start after that date, a 90-day waiting period begins from your employment start date, with the coverage becoming effective on the first day of the month following this period. This waiting period is continuous and uninterrupted.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, disability benefits commence under two scenarios: injury (row 2) and sickness (row 4). For both cases, total disability must be sustained for a consecutive 30 days (rows 3 & 5). If the disabled individual is also working, benefit eligibility requires concurrent total disability status. The difference lies in the commencement date; injury-related disability benefits start from the 30th day of total disability, whereas sickness-related benefits are triggered one day later, on the 31st day of total disability.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, the weekly benefit is calculated as the lesser of three options: firstly, 60% of the earnings on which premiums have been paid for you; secondly, 60% of your pre-disability earnings; or thirdly, $1,500. Any Other Income Benefits are subtracted from this amount. This calculation ensures that the weekly benefit does not exceed the specified thresholds.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, benefits payable for injuries or sicknesses are limited to 9 weeks. The duration of coverage remains the same regardless of whether the disability is caused by injury or sickness. This policy applies only to eligible individuals and covers a maximum of 9 weeks' worth of benefits. It is essential to adhere to all policy terms and conditions for eligibility, including the proper filing of claims within the specified timeframe.
<EOS>
According to the Additional Benefits section of Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 9, row 1), the Disabled and Working Benefit is available. Eligible policyholders can receive a monthly payment equal to 20% of their pre-disability earnings if they become disabled and continue working in a reduced capacity during that period. The benefit payment begins after a 60-day waiting period following disability onset, and ends when the disability ceases or the total benefit amount reaches $3,000, whichever comes first. This benefit can be received concurrently with other disability benefits but may not exceed 100% of the pre-disability earnings. The maximum monthly payment is capped at $2,500, and the policyholder must meet all other policy requirements to qualify for this benefit.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, eligibility for coverage is extended to all individuals within the specified classes listed in the Schedule of Insurance (row 2, page 9). These Eligible Persons will have access to the insurance benefits as described in the policy documents. This coverage applies to all persons within the defined classes without distinction based on age, gender, or occupation unless explicitly stated otherwise.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, you will become eligible for coverage when either the Participating Employer's effective date is reached or if you have completed the Eligibility Waiting Period for Coverage shown in the Schedule of Insurance, if applicable. The eligibility period starts from the mentioned rows on page 36.
<EOS>
To enroll for coverage under this policy provided in Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, complete and sign a group insurance enrollment form within 31 days of becoming eligible. Deliver the completed form to your employer. Failure to enroll during this period or if you were previously eligible but did not enroll, future enrollment will require providing Evidence of Insurability acceptable to the insurer. If you choose to enroll at a later time under these circumstances, this evidence is vital for approval.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf section outlines the concept of Evidence of Insurability, a requirement for policy coverage that may involve completing and signing an approved application, undergoing a medical examination, providing an attending Physician's statement, and supplying any other necessary information. The Company covers all associated costs. If the supplied evidence is not deemed satisfactory, your weekly benefit will match what you would have received without providing Evidence of Insurability, but only if enrollment occurs within 31 days following eligibility. Failure to meet this deadline results in no coverage under the policy.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 10, rows 2-8, your insurance coverage will commence based on the earliest of three scenarios:

1) You become eligible and have enrolled by then,
2) Your enrollment within 31 days following your eligibility date, or
3) Our approval of your Evidence of Insurability for benefit amounts necessitating such proof. The coverage effective date applies to all scenarios mentioned above.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, the effective date for coverage or any changes in coverage, such as increased benefits or new benefits under the policy, will be deferred if you are not Actively at Work on the scheduled start date due to a physical or mental condition. The coverage will commence only when you return to active employment. This rule applies regardless of whether you are initially covered by the policy or undergoing an increase in benefits or acquiring a new benefit.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf pages [10, 11], you may decrease or increase your coverage options, with any increase subject to approval and effective on the Deferred Effective Date. Coverage adjustments occur upon changes in class or Pre-disability Earnings, but only if you are an Active Employee not absent due to Disability. Any notice of earnings change will not become effective until received by us. Policy modifications due to employer changes take effect on the date of the alteration, also subject to the Deferred Effective Date.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, if an individual was insured under a prior policy and was ineligible for benefits on the day before the Participating Employer Effective Date, the Deferred Effective Date provision will not apply. This means that regardless of when the new policy becomes effective, the individual is not eligible for coverage continuity from their previous policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, your policy coverage will terminate on the earliest of six possible scenarios: 1) the policy termination date, 2) when you are no longer eligible for coverage or the policy ceases to cover your class, 3) if a premium payment is not made when due, 4) upon termination of your employment by your employer, 5) if you are no longer Actively at Work, or 6) if your employer stops being a Participating Employer. However, this termination may be prevented under certain Continuation Provisions.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf details continuation provisions of coverage that can be extended beyond termination dates if the employer provides a uniform plan to all employees. Coverage may not exceed one continuation provision and is subject to reductions in policy terms, premium payments, and any applicable maximum time limits. Continued coverage ends when the policy terminates or the employer ceases being a participating employer.

  On documented leave of absence (excluding Family and Medical Leave or Military Leave), coverage can be continued until the month following the commencement of leave. Military leave of absence coverage may continue for up to 8 weeks, while Family Military Leave of Absence coverage (for spouses/children serving outside continental US, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, or Alaska) can last up to 15 days if specific conditions are met.

   Lay-offs due to lack of work allow continued coverage until the month following the commencement of lay-off, unless it becomes permanent. Status changes, such as being employed by the policyholder but no longer in an Eligible Class due to reduced hours, permit continued coverage for three consecutive months after the reduction in scheduled hours.

   Disability insurance allows continued coverage when working for the policyholder and receiving benefits under a Group Long Term Disability Insurance Policy while earning at least 20% but less than 80% of pre-disability earnings. If not actively at work due to sickness or injury, all coverages may be continued for up to 12 consecutive months or as required by applicable law if leave of absence is granted according to family and medical leave laws.

   Family Medical Leave allows coverage continuation for up to 8 weeks (or 26 weeks if eligible for Family Military Leave) following the commencement of leave, with continuation ending immediately if the leave terminates prematurely.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, if you become disabled and cease being an active employee, your insurance coverage will continue during your disability period and until the end of your short-term disability benefits entitlement. Afterward, your insurance can be reinstated under three conditions: first, you must return to work for one full day as a full-time active employee in an eligible class; second, the policy remains in force; and third, premiums for you were paid during your disability and continue to be paid.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 12 (rows 1-7), if you are entitled to disability benefits and your participating employer's coverage terminates, your benefits will continue as long as your disability persists by the same condition. However, these benefits will not extend beyond the date when we would have stopped paying benefits if the insurance had remained active. The termination of your participating employer's coverage for any reason will not affect our liability under this provision. Essentially, your disability benefits will end either when your disability resolves or on the original termination date of the insurance policy, whichever comes later.
<EOS>
Under the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, you are entitled to a Monthly Disability Benefit if you meet specific conditions: firstly, becoming Disabled while insured under this Policy; secondly, being Disabled for the entire Elimination Period; thirdly, remaining Disabled post the Elimination Period; and fourthly, submitting Proof of Loss. These benefits start from the day after the Elimination Period, with payments made monthly, subject to the Maximum Duration of Benefits constraint. Importantly, your benefits will not exceed this maximum duration.
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 12, rows 2-3), the calculation of benefits for a period less than a week is based on a daily rate. Specifically, if you're disabled for fewer than five days, we will pay one-fifth (1/5) of your weekly benefit for each day you are disabled. This means that for every day of disability in a week, you'll receive a fraction of your total weekly benefit.
<EOS>
Under the Disabled and Working Benefits outlined in Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, if you are disabled while covered but still working, your weekly benefit for total disability will be reduced by half of your current weekly earnings. If you participate in a rehabilitative employment program approved by us, we will calculate your weekly benefit according to the Rehabilitative Employment Benefit guidelines. Days spent disabled and working can contribute towards satisfying the Benefits Commence Period.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 12, rows 2-12), if you return to work as an active employee and then become disabled due to the same or a related cause within 15 consecutive calendar days, your initial disability period and the recurrent disability will be considered one period of disability, provided the policy remains in force.

<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 46, rows 2-11, written Proof of Loss must be submitted within 90 days from the start date of the claim period for which payment is due. Failure to submit proof by this deadline will not automatically invalidate the claim if it was impossible to provide it in time and proof is subsequently given as soon as possible, but no later than one year after the deadline, unless the policyholder is not legally competent. The insurance company may request Proof of Loss throughout the duration of the disability, and in such cases, it must be provided within 30 days of the request.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, if you are deemed disabled and eligible for benefits under the policy, benefit payments will be issued at the end of each week that you are disabled.

Any payment due after a claim is terminated will be issued once proof of loss acceptable to them is received.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, all payments for your claim will be made directly to you. In the event of your death, any outstanding benefits may be paid to your estate. If a payment is owed to your estate, a minor, or an incompetent person, up to $1,000 can be paid to a relative at the insurer's discretion. Such a payment will fulfill the responsibility for the amount disbursed.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 15, rows 2-12, if a claim for benefits is denied partially or entirely, you will receive a written notification detailing the reasons for the denial, referencing relevant policy provisions, describing any additional information required to substantiate the claim, and outlining the review procedure.

During this process, you can ask for copies of relevant documents and submit additional information related to your claim. The insurance company will respond with a final decision in writing.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf document details the arbitration process for disputes over Disability Benefits. If you disagree with a decision made after final review of your claim, you have the right to initiate arbitration by contacting the American Arbitration Association's main office in Washington, D.C. Proceedings will adhere to established Employee Benefit Plan Claim procedures by this association. The arbitration is conducted by a neutral, sole arbitrator selected from their approved panel for employee benefit disputes. Each party bears equally the cost of arbitration unless otherwise ordered by the arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision is final and binding, and it can be made into a court judgment in any jurisdiction with competent authority.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 15 rows 2-8, you must apply for Social Security disability benefits when your disability's duration meets the minimum required period. The application should be submitted within 45 days following our request for such documentation. If your eligibility is initially denied by the Social Security Administration, you are obligated to follow their established process for reconsideration and, if rejected again, request a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Hearing and Appeals.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (pages 15, 16) details how disability benefits under the United States Social Security Act are estimated and potentially deducted from your weekly benefit. The insurance company reserves the right to reduce your weekly benefit if they estimate that you or your dependent may be eligible for such benefits.

If eligible, the company may estimate the amount of these benefits and reduce your weekly benefit accordingly. However, reduction does not occur if you have applied for Social Security disability benefits, pursued all required appeals, authorized the Social Security Administration to release information, signed a reimbursement agreement, or if there's no possibility to appeal the denial from an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Hearing and Appeals.

If your weekly benefit has been reduced by an estimated amount and you later receive Social Security disability benefits, the company will adjust your weekly benefit upon receiving proof of the awarded amount. Conversely, if your application is denied, they will adjust your weekly benefit when you provide proof of final denial.

If the actual Social Security benefits were lower than the estimate, a refund will be issued in a lump sum. If higher and overpayments occurred on your weekly benefit, you must make a lump sum refund equal to all overpayments, adhering to the Overpayment Recovery provision.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, an overpayment occurs under this policy when the total paid benefits exceed what is due, or a payment is made that should have been allocated to another group policy. This can happen due to retroactive awards from sources within the Other Income Benefits definition, failure to report or late notification of Other Income Benefits or earned income, misstatements, fraud, errors, or any other related issues. Overpayments may stem from various causes such as incorrect reporting, late notice, or inaccurate information provided, among others.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, the insurer retains the right to recover any overpayments made under the policy within 30 days from the claimant. This includes refunding the amount directly or allowing recovery from other organizations, insurance companies, payees, or the estate. The insurer may also offset future benefits, refer unpaid balances to a collection agency, and pursue legal action if necessary. Any reimbursement agreement signed upon becoming eligible for benefits will further outline these terms.
<EOS>
According to the Subrogation section in Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 16, rows 2-10, if you sustain a Disability due to another party's act or omission and receive lost wage benefits under The Policy, failing to initiate legal action against that Third Party within a reasonable timeframe allows the company to exercise subrogation rights over any claims against the Third Party. The company may choose to pursue legal action against the Third Party for recovering payments made in connection with your Disability. This right persists until you take action yourself.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, the company reserves the right to be reimbursed for any disability benefits paid or due, if you recover compensation from a third party. This can occur via legal judgment, arbitration award, settlement, or other means. If such recovery occurs, you are obligated to repay the lower of: a) the amount the company paid or was due; or b) the recovered amount from the third party, minus any reasonable attorney fees related to the recovery. The amounts involved in this reimbursement are contingent on the details specified within these pages and rows.
<EOS>

   - A "dependent" is defined as a spouse, party to a civil union in Vermont, or a child (natural, stepchild, adopted, or dependent minor/disabled child) born or brought to a marriage or civil union under Vermont law.
   - A "child or covered child" refers to any child (natural, step-child, adopted, or dependent minor/disabled child) born or brought to a marriage or civil union in Vermont.
<EOS>
Under Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, Vermont law grants civil union partners equal benefits, protections, and responsibilities as married couples under state law. However, federal laws such as ERISA may limit or exclude these benefits for civil unions regarding private employer health plans. For example, government employers offer health benefits to dependents of civil union partners if they provide the same to spouses, while federal employers do not have this requirement. Group health insurance continuation rights and Internal Revenue Code treatment of premiums are also subject to federal law. As a result, access to certain benefits under this policy may vary for parties in a civil union and their families due to federal laws. Seek expert advice to understand your contract's specifics. For Washington residents, the Surviving Spouse definition in the Survivor Income Benefit is amended for civil unions.

In the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (pages 27-28), a key change has been made to the General Work Stoppage continuation provision. If your employment ends due to a general work stoppage, such as a strike or lockout, your coverage will be extended during that time for up to six months. This extension will last until the end of the month in which your coverage initially terminated. However, if the work stoppage concludes before then, the continuation ceases immediately. The Policy Interpretation provision has been removed entirely. For Wisconsin residents, time periods stated in the Claim Appeal provision have been deleted. In all other aspects, the policy and certificates remain consistent. This information is signed for Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company.

According to the Pre-Existing Condition Limitation on Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, specific health conditions existing before the effective date of coverage may be subject to a waiting period of up to 12 months from the policy's inception. During this period, benefits may be limited, payable only at the greater of (a) the actual charges or (b) customary and reasonable charges for services rendered. After the waiting period, benefits will be provided at the policy's specified level, but certain conditions or complications related to the pre-existing condition may still be subject to a coinsurance requirement of 20% for two years following the end of the waiting period. Any treatment sought during the first year following the effective date that is directly or indirectly associated with the pre-existing condition will be covered only if it is considered medically necessary and not related to the pre-existing condition.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, page 67, row 1, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) section outlines the terms for Long Term Disability benefits. The policy provides monthly benefits equal to 60% of the pre-disability earnings, subject to a maximum of $15,000 per month and a minimum of $500 per month. The waiting period is six months following the date of disability, during which no benefits are payable.

After that, the benefit period changes to any occupation and lasts until age 67. The policy further specifies that benefits will cease upon death of the insured.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 35 rows 2, 1, 2, and 3, full-time active employees who are citizens or legal residents of the United States are eligible for coverage. This excludes physicians, temporary, leased, or seasonal employees. Full-time employment is defined as working at least 30 hours weekly, not including on-call hours.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, the maximum monthly benefit is the least of three options: $6,000, the Benefit Percentage applicable to the policyholder multiplied by their Pre-disability Earnings on which premium has been paid, or the Benefit Percentage applicable to the policyholder multiplied by their Pre-disability Earnings. The calculation for the benefit amount takes into account the specified rows on page 35 of the document.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 35, rows 2-6, the Minimum Monthly Benefit is the greater of two options: $100 or 10% of the Maximum Monthly Benefit you're eligible for under The Policy, prior to deducting Other Income Benefits. This minimum benefit is a crucial aspect of the policy structure, ensuring a certain level of support during eligible claim periods.

According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, this policy outlines benefit payment durations based on age and retirement status. Prior to reaching Normal Retirement Age (NRA), benefits are payable for varying periods: 48 months if over 63 years old, 42 months if between 63-64, 36 months at 65, 27 months at 66, 24 months at 67, 21 months at 68, and 18 months at 69 and above. The NRA is defined by the Social Security Act's 1983 revision and varies depending on your birth year. For example, if born in 1955, your NRA is 66; while for those born in 1960 or later, it's 67. Benefits will be payable for a minimum of 18 months post-NRA.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, the Normal Retirement Age (NRA) varies depending on birth year. If born in 1937 or earlier, NRA is 65; for those born between 1938 and 1942, NRA ranges from 65 + 2 months to 65 + 10 months. Individuals born in 1943 through 1954 have an NRA of 66. After 1960, the NRA is 67. These ages are subject to adjustments if one retires before or after the specified age.

This Family Care Credit Benefit, as detailed in Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 36, row 2), offers financial assistance when a policyholder is unable to work due to the need to provide care for a family member with a severe health condition. The benefit provides up to 60% of the policyholder's weekly earnings, subject to a maximum and minimum weekly limit, for a period of up to 12 months. To qualify, the family member must have a doctor's certification that they require full-time care due to a severe health condition. The benefit begins after a 30-day waiting period and can be used concurrently with other disability benefits, but not Short Term Disability or Business Overhead Expense benefits.

According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on page 36, row 2, a Survivor Income Benefit is provided. This benefit ensures a specified percentage of the insured's monthly salary, ranging from 50% to 100%, for a predetermined period (up to age 65) or until the death of the beneficiary. The amount payable is based on the insured's annual base salary as of the date of disability and is subject to an annual cost-of-living adjustment. Eligibility for this benefit requires the insured to be under age 65 at the time of disability, have worked a minimum of 720 hours in the 18 months preceding the disability, and be unable to perform their regular job duties due to sickness or injury. The benefit starts after an elimination period (between 30 and 180 days) and continues until the earlier of the beneficiary's death or the insured reaching age 65.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf Workplace Modification Benefit (row 2, page 36) outlines coverage for necessary workplace modifications to accommodate an employee's occupational injury or illness. The policy provides up to $10,000 for such alterations with a maximum of $5,000 per calendar year. These changes can include job site adjustments, equipment alterations, or accommodative tools. The employer is responsible for the cost, and reimbursement is subject to prior approval. The policy also states that modifications should be made as soon as practicable but no later than 15 days after receipt of a written request from the employee or their authorized representative. Any changes deemed unreasonably delayed may result in the denial of benefits.

According to the Progressive Illness Benefit in Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 36, row 2), this policy provides a benefit for covered individuals diagnosed with a specified critical or chronic illness. To qualify, the individual must be confined to a hospital, nursing home, or hospice facility due to the illness. The benefit is payable in a lump sum of up to $50,000 upon diagnosis and an additional $10,000 annually for as long as the condition persists. This benefit does not apply during the first 24 months following the policy's effective date unless hospital confinement occurs within this period.

The maximum amount payable is $375,000, with prorated payments based on the extent and severity of loss. This benefit will remain active until the policy expiration date provided in the policy documents.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 68, row 2), Eligible Persons for coverage are those individuals or entities specified in the Schedule of Insurance. This means that only the persons detailed within this schedule are qualified to receive benefits under the policy's terms and conditions. It is essential to carefully review the Schedule of Insurance to ensure understanding of who qualifies for coverage, as this document plays a crucial role in determining eligibility.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, it is outlined that providing satisfactory Evidence of Insurability is essential to securing coverage under The Policy. This evidence may involve a completed and approved application, medical examination, attending physician's statement, and any additional information required by us. All costs related to this evidence will be covered by us. If the provided evidence is deemed unsatisfactory, there are consequences: 1) Your Monthly Benefit equals the amount for which you were eligible without providing Evidence of Insurability, granted enrollment occurs within 31 days of your initial eligibility; or 2) You will not be covered under The Policy if enrollment happens more than 31 days after initial eligibility.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf at pages 68, rows 2-1, your coverage will commence on the date you become eligible. However, it's essential to note that all effective dates are subject to the Deferred Effective Date provision. This means that while your policy technically begins when you're eligible, there may be a delay in its activation due to specific policy conditions. Please review your policy for further details on these provisions.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 37 rows 2-14, your insurance or increased coverage effective date will be deferred if you are absent from work due to accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse, pregnancy, and you would have otherwise started the coverage on that day. The deferment will last until you actively return to work for one full day. This provision applies to all five scenarios mentioned.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, you can either decrease or increase your coverage options, including upgrading to a higher tier. Approval is required for any increase, with effective dates deferred due to pre-existing conditions and subject to your active employment status. A change in your class or rate of pay may lead to increased or decreased coverage on the corresponding date, provided you are actively employed and not disabled at that time. Notification of earnings changes is necessary but takes effect only when received by the insurance provider. In case of policy alterations by the employer, adjustments become effective immediately, still subject to deferred effective dates and pre-existing conditions limitations.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages [37, 38], if coverage was under a prior policy but not eligible for benefits the day before the Participating Employer Effective Date, the Deferred Effective Date provision does not apply. If insured under the new policy and covered under the prior policy on the day before the Participating Employer Effective Date, the Pre-existing Condition Limitation ends on the earliest of either the Participating Employer Effective Date (if unlimited by pre-existing condition restriction under the prior policy) or the date the restriction would have ceased under the prior policy. The Monthly Benefit for a Pre-existing Condition will be the lesser of the amount paid by the prior policy or the new policy. The Pre-existing Conditions Limitation applies after the Participating Employer Effective Date to benefit increases from changes in policies, options, classes, or benefits. If disabled under the prior policy and return to work as a Full-time Active Employee before the Participating Employer Effective Date, and have a recurrence of that disability within 6 months while covered by the new policy with no benefits available for the recurrence under the prior policy, the Elimination Period will be waived.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, your coverage terminates on the earliest of seven events: policy termination, no longer insuring your class, unpaid premiums or missed payment dates, the end of the premium period, employment termination or ceasing to be a full-time active employee in an eligible class for any reason, or your employer ceasing to participate. Continuation provisions may apply if these events occur unless specified otherwise.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf section on pages [38, 39] outlines continuation provisions for insurance coverage. Coverage can be extended past the termination date if an employer offers a consistent plan to all employees and pays premiums. Continued coverage is subject to policy reductions, terminating when the policy does, the employer ceases participation, or coverage for your class terminates. Your benefit level will remain as it was before continuation.

Family Military Leave of Absence allows continued coverage for up to 15 days if your spouse or child enters active military service outside specific locations, provided you meet certain employment and service requirements. Family Medical Leave enables up to 8 weeks (or 26 weeks if also qualifying for military leave) of insurance continuation following the start of a leave granted under the Family and Medical Leave Act or similar state/local law. Continuation ends immediately if the leave terminates early.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 39 rows 2-6, if you become disabled and stop being an active employee, your insurance coverage will continue under specific conditions. Firstly, during the Elimination Period while you remain disabled by the same disability. Secondly, following the Elimination Period, your coverage will last as long as you are entitled to benefits under the policy. Essentially, this means that if you're disabled and no longer an active employee, your insurance will be extended during the defined elimination period, and thereafter, for as long as the policy allows based on your eligibility for benefits.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 39 rows 2-6, no premiums will be charged for the insured after the Elimination Period ends and as long as benefits are still being paid out. This waiver of premium applies solely when receiving insurance benefits due to a disability. It is essential to note that the Elimination Period varies among policies, so it's crucial to consult the specific terms of your policy for details on its duration.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, it is stated that if you become disabled and your participating employer's coverage terminates, your benefits will continue as long as your disability persists by the same condition. However, these benefits will not extend beyond the date when payments would have ceased if the insurance had remained active. The termination of the participating employer's coverage for any reason will not affect our liability under this provision. In other words, your benefits will continue for the same disability until they would have ended had the insurance remained active.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (pages 39-40), if your insurance terminates due to employment cessation not caused by retirement or ineligibility for an eligible class, and you've been insured continuously for at least 12 months, are able to perform duties of your occupation, the policy is still active, and you're not covered under another group policy, you have a right to enroll in their group long term disability conversion policy within 31 days. To do so, you must submit a written request along with the premium and enrollment fee for the conversion policy. The coverage will be effective the day after your current policy ends and issued without Evidence of Insurability. The terms, including type, amount, and premium for the group long term disability conversion Policy will depend on the insurance provided by the conversion policy at the time of enrollment. This conversion may offer different benefits compared to the original policy.

According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 40 rows [2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], benefits for mental illness or substance abuse disabilities are subject to a maximum duration. Disabling conditions such as those resulting from any cause (mental illness) or under treatment (alcoholism), or non-medical use of certain substances will have limited benefits payable. These benefits can last either until your confinement in a medical facility ends, or for a total of 24 months across all such disabilities during your lifetime, if you're not confined or after discharge.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, any periods of recovery during the elimination period won't affect it if your active work days are less than half the length of your elimination period. Days within this recovery period don't count towards the elimination period. After the elimination period ends, if you recover from disability but become disabled again due to the same or a related cause within 365 days, these instances will be considered as one continuous period of disability, provided the policy remains active. If you remain non-disabled for 365 days or more, any subsequent disabilities are treated as new ones with their own elimination period and maximum duration of benefits, subject to the terms and conditions in effect at that time.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, page 40, row 2, the term 'Recover' or 'Recovery' indicates that your disability status has changed, and you are no longer disabled as you have returned to work with your employer. Notably, premiums for you will be paid during this period. This change in status may affect the policy benefits, so it is crucial to review the policy details accordingly.
<EOS>
Under the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, your Disability benefits are calculated when you're disabled after the Elimination Period and earning 20% or less of your Indexed Pre-disability Earnings. The Monthly Benefit is determined by multiplying your Pre-disability Earnings by the Benefit Percentage. This figure is compared with the Maximum Benefit, and from the lesser amount, Other Income Benefits are deducted to arrive at your Monthly Benefit.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, during disability and if you earn more than 20% of your indexed pre-disability earnings, your monthly benefit for up to 12 consecutive months will be determined by multiplying your pre-disability earnings by the benefit percentage. The maximum benefit applies. Other income benefits are deducted from this amount, but current monthly earnings won't reduce your monthly benefit.

However, if the sum of your monthly benefit and current monthly earnings exceeds 100% of your pre-disability earnings, your monthly benefit will be reduced by the excess. The 12 consecutive month period begins on the last of either the day you start earning more than 20% or the end of the elimination period.

If you're disabled, not receiving benefits under the Return to Work Incentive, and earn more than 20%, your monthly benefit will be the greater of either the Proportionate Loss Formula or the 50% Offset Formula. These guidelines apply to rows [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] on page [41].
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on page 41 row 5, the policy outlines an Indexed Pre-disability Earnings benefit. If you become disabled and your earnings are less than 20% of your pre-disability income, you will receive a monthly benefit based on that percentage difference. This benefit is adjusted annually using a cost of living adjustment (COLA) formula until the end of the policy term or your return to work, whichever occurs first. The pre-disability earnings considered are the average of your 36 months' worth of earnings prior to disability, indexed to the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 41, rows 1-5 and 1-2, if the sum of your Monthly Benefit, Current Monthly Earnings, and Other Income Benefits surpasses 100% of your Pre-disability Earnings, your Monthly Benefit will be reduced by the excess. However, it will not fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit. Additionally, in case of an overpayment, recovery of all or part of the overpayment may occur, following the Overpayment Recovery provision.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on page 41, row 2, your Monthly Benefit under this policy will never fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit as stated in the Schedule of Insurance. This ensures a certain level of coverage throughout the duration of the policy, providing financial support during times of need.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 41, rows 2 and 3, if a Monthly Benefit is payable for a period less than a month, the benefit will be calculated as one-thirtieth (1/30) of the Monthly Benefit for each day you are disabled. This means that if you are disabled for 10 days in a month, you will receive 10/30 of your monthly benefit for that period. This calculation is based on the total number of days in the month, not just the days you were disabled. This policy applies to situations where the disability occurs anywhere within the month, regardless of when it starts or ends.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, Family Care Credit Benefit allows deduction of Family Care expenses from earnings while in a Rehabilitation program. This benefit applies to care or supervision of children under 13 or mentally/physically handicapped dependents within the household. Monthly deductions are capped at $350 for the first 12 months, then $175 thereafter, not exceeding monthly earnings. Annual Family Care Credit cannot surpass $2,500, and deductions are reduced proportionally for periods less than a month. Documented receipts from caregivers are required, and this benefit ceases once Rehabilitation ends or Family Care Credits have been deducted for 24 months during Disability. No Family Care provided by relatives is eligible as a deduction. Monthly Benefit eligibility requires Current Monthly Earnings after the Family Care Credit deduction to be less than 80% of Pre-disability Earnings.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on page 42 (rows 2-8, 1-2), if you are receiving a Monthly Disability Benefit at the time of your death, your survivors may receive a Survivor Income Benefit. This benefit will be paid upon receipt of satisfactory proof of your death and the claimant's entitlement. Proof must be submitted within one year following your death.

The Survivor Income Benefit is payable to: 1) your surviving spouse, if any; 2) if no spouse, equally to your children; or 3) if no spouse or children, to your estate. However, any overpayment on your claim will be deducted first. The Survivor Income Benefit is calculated as three times your Maximum Monthly Benefit.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 42, rows 2-10), a Surviving Spouse is defined as the legally non-separated or non-divorced spouse at the time of policyholder's death. However, a domestic partner or civil union partner may be considered as well, under two conditions: firstly, if a domestic partner affidavit demonstrating partnership for The Policy has been executed and found satisfactory by the insurer; secondly, if registration as a domestic partner or civil union member is available through a government agency or office. Proof of such registration must be provided unless doing so is legally prohibited. Continued eligibility is contingent upon meeting the requirements detailed in the affidavit or mandated by law.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, Surviving Children are defined as unmarried children, stepchildren, or legally adopted children who were primarily dependent on the policyholder for support and maintenance at the time of death. These children must be under age 21, or between ages 21 and 25 while in full-time attendance at an institution of learning. Additionally, any children related to the policyholder by blood or marriage or domestic partnership who lived with them in a regular parent-child relationship and were eligible as dependents on the policyholder's federal income tax return for the last tax year before death are also considered Surviving Children. If a minor child is entitled to benefits, payments may be made to their caregiver until a legal guardian is appointed.

This Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf section discusses the Workplace Modification Benefit, applicable on page numbers [43] rows [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The policy reimburses an employer for reasonable workplace modifications to accommodate a covered disability, enabling the policyholder's return as an active employee. Qualification hinges on: (1) coverage under the policy; (2) employer agreement to make accommodative workplace changes; and (3) written approval of proposed modifications by the insurer. Approved modifications' reimbursement does not surpass the amount equal to item number 1 of the Maximum Monthly Benefit.

The insurer reserves the right to examine or evaluate the policyholder by a healthcare professional, vocational expert, or rehabilitation specialist. After the proposed modifications are complete, proof of expenses is provided, and the policyholder returns to work as an active employee, the employer's costs for approved modifications will be reimbursed.

This Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf segment discusses Workplace Modification and the Progressive Illness Benefit on pages 43, rows 2, 3, 1, 2, 3. If you are disabled, changes to your work environment or job duties (Workplace Modification) will be made to accommodate you. This benefit payment will not impact any other policy benefits you may be entitled to.

If you're diagnosed with a Progressive Illness after becoming eligible for this policy benefit, and can provide satisfactory proof from your physician, you'll qualify for the Progressive Illness Benefit.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 43, rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2]), a Progressive Illness is defined as a non-infectious, indefinite disease or disorder that gradually impairs one's ability to perform their own occupation. If you become disabled due to such an illness, your pre-disability earnings will be the greater of either the amount confirmed by your physician at the time of proof submission or the amount at the time of disability under this policy. Benefits for disability resulting from a Progressive Illness are calculated using these pre-disability earnings and adhere to all other policy terms effective on the date of disability. Premiums are based on either the greater of your pre-disability earnings under this benefit or your pre-disability earnings according to the policy, until you meet the criteria for disability under this policy. Your premium will not decrease below the rate paid at the time proof of Progressive Illness is submitted unless you qualify for Waiver of Premium under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf pages 43 and 44, under the Accidental Dismemberment and Loss of Sight Benefit section, if an insured individual sustains a bodily injury in an accident within the covered policy period, a monthly benefit will be paid for the specified number of months following the Elimination Period. This payout is applicable for any of the listed losses: loss of sight in one or both eyes; or loss of limb(s), partial loss of limb(s), or loss of thumb and index finger on one hand. The benefit amount will be paid for at least the number of months indicated opposite each loss. This benefit is only payable if these losses occur within 365 days after the date of the accident.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 44 and the subsequent rows, the policy outlines various scenarios involving loss or impairment of different body parts:

- Loss or impairment of both hands results in a weekly indemnity of $2,688, payable for life.
- Loss or impairment of both feet has the same lifetime payment amount of $2,688.
- The loss or impairment of one hand and one foot entails a weekly payment of $1,750, also for life.

<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, under section One Eye, it is detailed that the monthly benefit amount for a thumb and index finger injury on either hand is based on two conditions:

1) The amount should be the lesser of the Maximum Monthly Benefit stated in the policy's Schedule of Insurance, or
2) Your Pre-disability Earnings multiplied by the Benefit Percentage.

This means that the benefit received will not exceed the maximum specified in the policy, or what you were earning prior to the disability times the percentage shown in the policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, loss is defined in terms of specific physical impairments. These include the actual severance of hands and feet above the wrist or ankle joints, complete and irreversible paralysis of certain limbs, the entire and irrecoverable loss of sight, speech, and hearing, and the actual severance of the thumb and index finger above the metacarpophalangeal joints. These events must occur to trigger the insurance coverage outlined in the document.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, under the Pre-existing Conditions Limitation on pages 44 rows [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], no benefits will be paid or increased for a Disability resulting from or caused or worsened by a Pre-existing Condition unless:

1. The insured has not received Medical Care for the condition during the previous 6 consecutive months while under The Policy; or
2. The insured has been continuously insured under The Policy for 12 consecutive months.
<EOS>
According to the terms outlined in Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 44 and 45 (rows 2-4, 5-7, 1-1, 2-3, 4), any pre-existing condition includes accidental bodily injuries, sicknesses, mental illnesses, pregnancies, or substance abuse issues, as well as their respective manifestations, symptoms, findings, or aggravations. These conditions must have received medical attention within the six months prior to either your coverage's effective date or a change in coverage.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 45 rows 2-5, medical care is covered when a physician or healthcare provider consults, offers advice, recommends, prescribes, or provides treatment. This policy covers necessary and reasonable medical services, supplies, equipment, hospitalization, diagnostic tests, surgery, and prescription medications, among other healthcare expenses. The policy also outlines maximum limits for each category of care, as well as deductibles and co-insurance percentages that apply to the insured's costs. Additionally, this section specifies pre-existing conditions exclusions, exceptions, and limitations, including a waiting period before coverage begins for such conditions.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 45 rows 2-5, the treatment coverage includes medical examinations, tests, and attendance or observation, as well as the use of drugs, medicines, medical services, supplies, or equipment. This comprehensive coverage applies to all necessary expenses associated with these services, subject to policy limits and terms. Additionally, it is important to note that this coverage may require prior authorization and pre-existing conditions may be subject to specific guidelines.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf pages 76 and 77, you or the beneficiary must provide written notice of a claim within 30 days following either the date of death or the date of loss. If providing notice within this timeframe is impossible, it should be given as soon as reasonably practical. The notice must include the claimant's name, address, and the Participating Employer Account Number.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 77 rows 2, 3, and 4, the policy requires a Proof of Loss claim submission within 15 days of notice. If no forms are provided within this timeframe, the claimant may submit alternative written proof that fully describes the nature and extent of the claim. Essentially, the company has 15 days to send the claim forms; if they fail to do so, any comprehensive written proof will be accepted.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, benefits are issued when a claimant is confirmed disabled and eligible (row 2-9, page 46). Payments are made at the end of each month while the claimant remains disabled (row 2). The insurance company may elect to make advance benefit payments based on an estimated duration of disability (row 3). If any payment is due after a claim's termination, it will be issued upon receiving satisfactory Proof of Loss (row 9).
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 46, rows 2-12), a claim denial notification will be provided in writing, detailing the specific reasons for the rejection and referencing the relevant policy provisions. The notification will also describe any additional information required to substantiate the claim, explaining why it's necessary, as well as outlining the review procedure. This process ensures transparency regarding claim denials.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, if your claim is denied, you or your representative have the right to request a full and fair review within specified timeframes: either 180 days for claims requiring determination of disability or 60 days for those not needing such determination. You may also ask for all relevant documents, records, and information, and submit additional written comments, documents, or information related to your claim. The insurer will then provide a final decision on the claim in writing.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 47 rows 2-8, you must apply for Social Security disability benefits when your disability's duration satisfies the minimum requirement. You have 45 days from our request to make this application. If the Social Security Administration initially denies your benefits eligibility, you are expected to adhere to their appeals process and subsequently request a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Hearing and Appeals if denied again.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, the insurance company reserves the right to reduce your disability benefits by estimating Social Security benefits you or your dependents may receive. This reduction occurs if they determine eligibility and estimate the benefit amount. Reductions will not apply if you've applied for SS disability benefits, pursued all appeals, authorized information release, signed a reimbursement agreement, and returned it.

If the estimated reduction is later found incorrect due to awarded or denied benefits, adjustments will be made accordingly. Overpayments will be refunded in a lump sum if SS benefits are lower than estimated, but you'll need to return all overpayments if higher. These rules follow the Overpayment Recovery provision.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, an overpayment is defined as the situation where the total benefits paid exceeds what you were entitled to under this policy or when a payment is made that should have been allocated to another group policy. This may arise from various circumstances such as retroactive awards from specified sources, failure to report other income benefits or earned income in a timely manner, misstatements, fraudulent activities, or any errors made by The Hartford.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 47 and 48, the policyholder grants The Company the right to recover any determined overpayment within 30 days. If reimbursement is late, The Company can recuperate overpayments from the policyholder, other organizations, insurance companies, payment recipients, or their estate; reduce or offset future benefits payable; refer the unpaid balance to a collection agency; and pursue legal action in court. Overpayments may be recovered from any source specified in a reimbursement agreement required upon benefit eligibility under The Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, if you suffer a Disability due to a Third Party's act or omission and receive lost wage benefits from the policy, failing to initiate legal action against the Third Party within a reasonable timeframe allows the company to be subrogated to any rights you may have against them. The company then has the option to bring legal action against the Third Party for recovering any payments made in relation to your Disability.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 48, rows 2, any third party whose actions or negligence contribute to you experiencing a Disability will have benefits paid or payable under the policy. This term, Third Party, encompasses individuals and legal entities alike. The Disability-related benefits are contingent upon this third party's role in causing your disability. The policy outlines specific conditions under which these benefits can be claimed and the corresponding payment structure.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, legal action against us can only be initiated under two timeframes. Firstly, such action cannot commence earlier than sixty days after the submission of a Proof of Loss. Secondly, any legal action must occur no later than three years following the date when the Proof of Loss is required to be given according to The Policy's terms.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 48, rows 2-6, Insurance Fraud is defined as knowingly providing false or incomplete information when filing a claim with the intention of deceiving the company.

Notably, for benefits to be payable, your post-disability earnings potential must exceed 60% of your indexed pre-disability earnings. This requirement is crucial in determining eligibility under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, bonuses are defined as the monthly average of monetary rewards you received from your employer during the calendar year preceding your disability onset (if more than the total duration of your employment), or throughout your entire tenure with the employer if it's shorter.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, the term "Commissions" refers to the monthly average of monetary commissions earned from the Employer during the calendar year immediately preceding your disability onset if you were actively employed for a full year prior.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, disability is defined as the inability to perform one or more essential duties of any occupation due to accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse, or pregnancy. During the elimination period, your disability must prevent you from performing the duties of your current occupation. If your monthly earnings during this period are 80% or more of your pre-disability earnings, the elimination period is extended for another 12 months, or until your current monthly earnings fall below 80%. After the elimination period, disability is determined based on any occupation. Your failure to maintain a license does not necessarily mean you are disabled, and having a suspended, revoked, restricted, or surrendered license does not qualify as disability.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (pages 50, rows 2-4), the Indexed Pre-disability Earnings are your pre-disability income adjusted annually by 5%. The first adjustment occurs on the first day of the month following receipt of 12 months of benefits. After this initial adjustment, annual increases will be made, with each increment also equating to a 5% increase, compounded yearly on the first day of the month following each anniversary of the initial adjustment date.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, your pre-disability earnings are defined as the regular monthly rate of pay from your employer, derived either from your W-2 earnings for the full tax year immediately preceding your last active work day before disability or for a lesser period if you worked for fewer than twelve consecutive months. This figure encompasses your wage income and contributions made through salary reduction agreements to 401(k), 403(b), 457 deferred compensation arrangements, executive non-qualified deferred compensation plans, or IRC Section 125 salary reduction plans for the same period. These earnings are crucial in determining your disability benefits.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (rows 2, 1 on pages 51 and 52), the term "Prior Policy" refers to the long-term disability insurance held by the Participating Employer on the day preceding a specific event.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 52, rows 2-4), your occupation is defined as the job you regularly performed before disability set in. It's not tied to a specific employer or location. For physicians, this means the general or sub-specialty recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS). If your sub-specialty isn't recognized by ABMS, you fall under the general specialty category. This definition applies universally across all occupations in this policy.

1. You must have executed a domestic partner affidavit acceptable to the company, proving your domestic partnership status for the policy.
2. Alternatively, you may register as domestic partners with a government agency where such registration is available and provide proof of this registration unless it's prohibited by law.

<EOS>
In the stipulations of Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 67, rows 2, 1, 1, 2), it is outlined that the Basic Principal Sum can never be less than $10,000.

According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, any life insurance amount in force for the policyholder may be subject to reduction under two circumstances: firstly, through exercise of the Conversion Right or secondly, via the Portability provision.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, the Life Insurance Benefit and Principal Sum will be decreased based on the table provided, effective from the ages stated in the document. This reduction takes effect on any existing coverage immediately prior to that date. If you become covered under the policy or experience a coverage increase after reaching age 65, reductions also apply to the current amount of coverage following all previous reductions. The specific percentage reduction for your coverage is indicated in the table.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 68 (rows 1-14, then 1-2), the reduction in coverage for various levels follows: 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, and 90% at rates of 35% and 25%.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 68, rows 2 and 3, for Non-Contributory Coverage, your employer will automatically enroll you without any action required from you initially. However, it's essential to complete a beneficiary designation form to specify who should receive benefits upon your demise. This coverage does not require any contributions from you, but it is subject to the terms and conditions outlined in the policy document.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, Waiver of Premium allows the policyholder to continue their Life Insurance coverage without paying premiums when disabled and qualified for Waiver of Premium. The continued coverage amount is the one in force on the date the policyholder ceases to be an Active Employee, subject to any reductions specified in the policy, and will not increase. This provision applies only to the policy details outlined in rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] on page [70].
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 70, rows 2 and 1, this policy pertains solely to Your Basic Life Insurance. A notable restriction is that you cannot concurrently apply for both the Portability Benefit and Waiver of Premium for the same coverage amount.

<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 70, rows 2-10, Disability is defined as an incapacity to perform any work for which you are or could be qualified by education, training, or experience due to injury or sickness. Additionally, a diagnosis of a life expectancy of 12 months or less qualifies as Disabled.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, you must meet the following conditions to qualify for the Waiver of Premium:

1. You must be insured under the policy and not exceed the age of 60 when you become disabled.
2. Provide evidence within a year of your last day as an active employee that you have been disabled for six consecutive months, starting from the date of your last active employment.
3. Throughout all this, you must have been actively employed under the policy to qualify for Waiver of Premium.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages [70, 71], if a Waiver of Premium is approved, the waiver will commence from a specified date. However, premiums won't be waived during the first 6 months of disability. The insurer may require Proof of Loss and periodic examinations during the initial 2 years following the submission of the first Proof of Loss. Failure to submit required proof or refusal to be examined may lead to the termination of the Waiver of Premium.

If the application for Waiver of Premium is denied, the policyholder may continue coverage under the Portability Benefit or convert coverage in accordance with the Conversion Right. If a disabled individual works for 5 days or less during the first 6 months of disability, the waiting period will not be interrupted. The individual must remain disabled by the same condition for the entire 6-month period, except for the initial 5 days worked. Working for more than 5 days requires a new waiting period to be satisfied.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, if you die within a year of your last active employment day before qualifying for Waiver of Premium, and meet certain conditions, your insurance will be payable. The conditions are: you must have been continuously disabled, this disability must have lasted or would have lasted for six months or more, and premiums must have been paid for the coverage. If these conditions are met, the amount of life insurance in force for you will be paid out.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, the Waiver of Premium will continue your coverage during disability until Normal Retirement Age if you're disabled before age 60. Afterwards, if you return to work in an Eligible Class as an Active Employee, you may be eligible for renewed coverage provided premiums are paid on time. If you don't return to such employment, coverage will end, and you might have a Conversion Right option within the specified time frame, subject to terms and conditions. The Amount of Life Insurance convertible is subject to the Conversion Right's terms, and Portability won't be available.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 71, rows 2-8), if your policy terminates or your employer stops being a Participating Employer before you qualify for the Waiver of Premium, you may have the Conversion Right, but only within specified time limits. Additionally, you might still be eligible for Waiver of Premium upon qualification. However, if the policy terminates or your employer ceases after you qualify for the Waiver of Premium, your coverage under this provision remains unaffected.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, the Life Insurance Benefit is payable upon your death while covered under The Policy. Payment will be made after receiving a Proof of Loss in accordance with the policy's Proof of Loss provision. The Life Insurance Benefit distribution adheres to the General Provisions outlined within The Policy.
<EOS>
Under Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, if you're terminally ill, aged under 60, and insured for at least $10,000, you may request an Accelerated Benefit (up to 80% of the policy amount, with a minimum of $3,000 and a maximum of $500,000). Requests must be in writing. The death benefit will be reduced by the Accelerated Benefit Amount. If terminally ill, you'll also meet the Disabled for Waiver of Premium definition. However, if required by law or a government agency to accelerate benefits, you must still fulfill all terms and conditions. If there's an assignment of rights regarding your life insurance, we need a release from the assignee before benefits are payable.

According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 72 (rows 2, 3, 1, 2), the policy holder must provide satisfactory proof of terminal illness for ongoing claims. This proof must be supplied by a physician. Failure to do so or refusal to undergo an examination as required could result in denial of the Accelerated Benefit payment.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 72 rows [2-11], if you are no longer terminally ill, your coverage may persist under specific conditions. If you return to an Eligible Class and pay the premium, coverage remains. If not, continued disability (subject to Waiver of Premium provision) maintains coverage. Upon leaving both Eligible Class and Disabled status, coverage terminates, but Conversion Right may be exercised within certain limits. The coverage amount is reduced by any Accelerated Benefit paid.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, if your life insurance coverage or any portion ends for any reason, you may have the right to convert it into an individual policy without providing Evidence of Insurability. However, conversion is not available for Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefits or any ineligible/uncovered amounts. If your policy terminates, coverage for an Eligible Class ends, or your employer is no longer a Participating Employer, you must have been insured for 5 years to convert; the limit is $10,000 or less than the policy's life insurance benefit if you become eligible for group life insurance within 31 days of termination. If coverage ends for other reasons, the full amount may be converted.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, at row 2 on page 73, 'Insurer' in this context refers to either us or another insurance company that has agreed to issue policies according to the Conversion Right. This provision allows you to convert your policy into a new one under different terms without providing evidence of insurability, as long as the conversion is made within specific timeframes and certain eligibility criteria are met. Typically, this right must be exercised within 365 days from the later of (1) the date the original policy terminates or lapses, or (2) the effective date of any change in the terms under which your coverage is provided that would be materially detrimental to you. The new policy issued will not contain any exclusion for a condition, illness, or injury based on its existence before the effective date of the new policy. Additionally, the new policy premium rate will not exceed the maximum permitted by law.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf outlines the process to convert your coverage. To initiate conversion, complete a Notice of Conversion Right form and get your employer's signature. Submit this within 31 days after Life Insurance termination or 15 days from your employer's signature, whichever is later, but not more than 91 days post-termination. The insurer will verify eligibility and send a Conversion Policy proposal. You must complete the request form in this proposal, pay the required premium within the specified time period, and return it to activate coverage effective from the 32nd day after coverage ends. This new policy replaces previous coverage for the stated amount under The Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, the Conversion Policy issued upon terminating The Policy offers Life Insurance coverage only, based on the Insurer's rates for new applicants of your class and age at the time of conversion. It does not offer the same terms as The Policy or provide additional benefits such as term insurance. Conversion is unavailable for any amount of Life Insurance being continued under certain provisions like Waiver of Premium, Portability, or Continuation until such coverage ends.
<EOS>
In the event of your death within 31 days after insurance coverage under Hartford Cert 5357370 terminates, we will pay the life insurance amount you would have been eligible to convert. This is contingent upon receiving Proof of Loss. However, if a conversion policy has already been initiated, no life insurance benefit will be provided from this policy for the converted amount.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 73, rows 2 and 3, Portability is a provision that enables policyholders to continue their coverage under a Group Portability policy when usual coverage termination would occur due to qualifying events. These events may include loss of eligibility for group insurance, retirement, COBRA exhaustion, or qualifying Medicare enrollment. The continuation period can last up to 36 months from the qualifying event date, during which premiums will remain the same as those under the group policy. Premium payments must be made on a monthly basis and failure to do so may result in loss of coverage. It's crucial to note that this provision may have specific eligibility requirements and exclusions; always refer to your policy for details.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf on pages 73 rows 2-6, qualifying events for policyholders include:

1. Termination of employment prior to Normal Retirement Age, or
2. Ending membership in an Eligible Class under the policy. These qualifying events enable policyholders to access their retirement benefits. The Normal Retirement Age varies, but it's typically a specified age stipulated within the policy terms.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, page [74], to elect Portability for your coverage after Basic ends due to a Qualifying Event, the policy must still be active and your employer must remain a Participant Employer. To apply, complete and obtain your employer's signature on a Portability application, submit it along with the required premium within 31 days of Life Insurance termination or 15 days from your employer signing the application, whichever is later, but not more than 91 days after termination. After verifying eligibility, we will issue a certificate for Portability coverage under a new policy, effective the day after Basic ends, with different terms and conditions than the original policy. The coverage will be issued without Evidence of Insurability on one of our current Portability forms.
<EOS>
Under Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, you can elect to continue 50%, 75%, or 100% of your ending life insurance amount (rounded to the nearest $1,000 multiple), but not exceeding $250,000. If you initially choose 50% or 75%, you cannot opt for more at a later date. The minimum continuable amount is $5,000. Portability is unavailable if you are inactive militarily or if you were previously ineligible or not covered under this provision. This policy does not extend portability for any life insurance amount that was initially ineligible to be covered.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, portability is not applicable for any life insurance amount being continued via conversion rights, waiver of premium provision, or continuation provisions within the policy. However, if only a portion of terminated coverage is elected for portability, or if the amount exceeds the maximum, then conversion rights may apply to the remaining amount. Notably, the waiver of premium provision is not available when electing portability coverage.

According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, the Seat Belt and Air Bag Benefit is payable when an injury results in a loss under the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit. The benefit is applicable if you were either a passenger wearing a seatbelt in a registered motor vehicle or its operator, as verified on the police accident report. The Seat Belt Benefit is the lesser of the Principal Sum multiplied by the Seat Belt Benefit Percentage or the Maximum Amount for this Benefit. Additionally, if you were in a seat equipped with an airbag and properly strapped in at the time of the airbag inflation, an Air Bag Benefit will also be paid, which is similarly calculated based on the Principal Sum and the Air Bag Benefit Percentage. A Minimum Benefit will be payable under the Seat Belt Benefit if it cannot be determined whether you were wearing a seatbelt at the time of the accident. Payments are made according to the Proof of Loss provision and General Provisions of The Policy.

Such limits may be determined through various means of testing BAC or other substances in the context of the accident.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, if a policyholder experiences an injury resulting in death covered under the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit outside their permanent residence's territorial limits, a Repatriation Benefit will be paid.

The deadline may be extended for those who are incompetent.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (pages 77, rows 2-6), while a claim is pending, we have the right, at our expense, to arrange for the person who experienced a loss to undergo medical examinations by a Physician as often as we deem necessary. Additionally, in the event of death where it's not legally prohibited, we may request an autopsy. These procedures are intended to aid in claim assessment and resolution.
<EOS>
As per the Claim Payment section in Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (pages 77, rows 2-3), if benefits are determined to be payable, they will be issued within 30 days after receiving the Proof of Loss submission.

<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (pages 77-78) outlines the beneficiaries for life insurance and accidental death benefits. If no named beneficiary survives, The Hartford may pay to the executors/administrators of the estate, surviving spouse, children, or parents. Additionally, up to $500 for burial expenses may be given to a person equitably entitled. Minor beneficiaries' shares are paid until a legal guardian is appointed, with initial payments of $200 and subsequent monthly installments not exceeding $200. Payments release The Hartford from further liability.

In the event of death, benefits can be deposited into a draft book account owned by either the policyholder or the beneficiary, with the owner having the option to receive a lump sum payment. However, no account will be established for a benefit payable to an estate. Any payments due to an estate, minor, or incompetent person may be paid up to $1,000 to a related individual entitled to it, fulfilling The Hartford's responsibility for the amount paid.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, you can designate or amend your beneficiary by submitting a written form acceptable to the Employer and filing it with them. Only valid forms received prior to your death will be accepted. The designation becomes effective on the date you signed and dated the form, regardless of any subsequent deaths.

<EOS>
In the event of a claim denial for benefits as outlined in Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, both you and your beneficiary will receive written notification detailing the decision.

According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, incontestability of the Life Insurance Benefit starts from its effective date and becomes non-contestable after two years. This provision excludes the Accidental Death and Dismemberment benefit(s). Any attempt to contest the insurance beyond the two-year period due to insurability statements requires those statements to be in writing, signed by you, and made after your insurance has been active for two years. Additionally, fraud is not applicable.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, you have the right to assign your rights and interest under the policy, including the ability to make required contributions, convert the insurance, and name or change a beneficiary.

Collateral assignments are prohibited under this policy. Exceptions apply to dismemberment benefits under the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, legal action against the insurer can only be initiated: after a minimum waiting period of 60 days following Proof of Loss furnishing, or no later than 3 years from the date when Proof of Loss is required under The Policy.

According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, insurance fraud is defined as providing false or misleading information during application or claims process with the intention of deceiving the company. This action is considered a crime, and the company reserves the right to employ various means for detection, investigation, deterrence, and prosecution of such offenders. Legal remedies will be pursued in case of fraudulent activities by the insured or employer.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 79, rows 2-6), any material facts about the policyholder not stated accurately may lead to adjustments in premium and a reassessment of coverage.

This means any conveyance or vehicle used by such operators falls under the category of Common Carrier, subject to the terms and conditions of the insurance policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 80, row 1), the term 'Employer' refers explicitly to the Policyholder in this policy.

In accordance with Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, dependent is defined as your spouse and any dependent child(ren). To be eligible, a person must be a U.S. citizen or resident of its territories/protectorates, excluding those in full-time military service unless they are later called to duty with the necessary premium paid. The age limit for children with disabilities under the Continuation for Dependent Children with Disabilities provision is extended to 21 if less than 21. A new addition to the Period of Coverage provisions states that:

- Coverage remains effective until the earlier of policy termination, death, or when the dependent becomes eligible for coverage under another group policy or reaches age 26, whichever comes first.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf detail pertains to reinstatement of coverage after military service (rows [13-43, 1-1]). If you enter active military service and are subsequently rehired within 12 months of your coverage termination or return from service, your prior coverage for you and your dependent spouse/dependents can be reinstated upon request within 31 days of returning to work. The reinstated coverage will maintain the same amounts as at the date of termination, be free from waiting periods, evidence of insurability, and pre-existing conditions limitations; however, it will adhere to the policy's terms.

The claims to be paid provision has been updated to allow for a portion of your life insurance benefit up to $500 to be paid to anyone equitably entitled due to funeral or illness-related expenses upon your death (row 42). The Seat Belt and Air Bag Benefit exclusion now applies if the injured person is intoxicated or under the influence of narcotics, unless advised by a physician (rows [19-20]).

For Massachusetts residents, the definition of terminal illness in the accelerated benefit cannot exceed 24 months. For Michigan residents, the policy interpretation provision has been deleted entirely. Additionally, for Minnesota residents, the term "granted military leave of absence" in the continuation section has been modified (rows [36-37]).
<EOS>
In Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, under Provisions section, a military leave of absence is documented. The original "Lay Off" provision from the Continuation Provisions has been deleted and replaced with this new term. This means that during an employee's military service, their coverage can be temporarily paused without causing layoff status. However, upon return from military duty, the employee must meet certain eligibility criteria to resume coverage under the policy. The document does not specify the exact duration of the military leave or any specific eligibility requirements for reinstatement.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf section on Lay Off (pages 82, 83) outlines the option to continue coverage if you are terminated or laid off. You have 60 days from either your coverage termination date or the written notice of your right to continue coverage to elect this continued coverage. The premium charged cannot exceed 102% of the premium paid for life insurance coverage for an active employee.

Your employer will inform you of your rights, the monthly premium amount, and payment methods. Upon request, they will provide a written verification of the cost of coverage. Coverage continues until the first of either you being covered under another group policy or the 18th month following termination/layoff. At the end of this period, you may convert to reduced benefits coverage or accept a policy with 83 reduced benefits at a lower premium rate.

Minnesota law stipulates that if your coverage ends due to employer non-compliance regarding notice or premium payment, they will be liable for benefit payments up to the extent we would have been. A lay off is defined as a reduction in hours making you ineligible for coverage, excluding discharge for gross misconduct but including retirement.

Additionally, the 7th paragraph of the Accelerated Benefit provision is deleted, as well as the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th paragraphs of the Conversion Right provision. The 5th paragraph of the Claims to be Paid provision's first sentence is amended to allow for payment into a draft book account (checking account) if benefits exceed $15,000. For Missouri residents, specific time periods in the Conditions for Qualification and the Benefit Payable before Approval of Benefits sections are not detailed.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, under the 180-day Waiver of Premium provision (rows 4-9 on page 83), if a disability claim is approved with Waiver of Premium, it will be effective from the start of your disability, following a 180-day waiting period. Notably, the Suicide provision has been replaced with new language.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf (page 83, rows [11-16, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]) outlines suicide-related coverage provisions. If death is due to suicide (sane or insane), no Supplemental Amount of Life Insurance or Dependent Life Insurance will be paid for a person who elected coverage within one year prior to their death, regardless of whether it's initial or increased coverage, except for benefit increases resulting solely from increased earnings. If death occurs due to suicide within one year of the policy effective date, all premiums are refunded. This time frame includes group life insurance coverage under the Prior Policy.

Regarding Accidental Death and Dismemberment benefits, suicide or attempted suicide (sane or insane) is added as an exclusion. For Montana residents, the Conversion Right period is extended to 3 years if greater than that, and the maximum amount is set at $10,000 if less. The second paragraph of the Conversion Policy Provisions is deleted for these residents, and the dollar amount in the Claims to be Paid provision is increased to $500 if it was not already at that amount; furthermore, a provision excluding suicide or attempted suicide from the Claims to be Paid provision is added.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf outlines several aspects of a life insurance policy. Death claims will be paid within 60 days of proof submission, with interest accrued if payment is made more than 30 days later, at the discount rate of 90-day commercial paper effective on the proof due date. For New Hampshire residents, certain provisions like Waiver of Premium and Disability Extension are deleted, while changes are made to the Conversion provision regarding notice timing and acceptance requirements. The Sending Proof of Loss section has an item deleted, and the dollar amount stated in the Claims to be Paid section may be $250 or another specified amount. Additionally, if Spouse Accidental Death and Dismemberment is included in the contract, there's a stipulation regarding the period of coverage.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf document, if you are separated or divorced from your spouse, their coverage may continue under this policy for up to three years following the divorce anniversary, unless you remarry, they remarry, a specified date is mentioned in the divorce decree, they fail to pay premiums, or you die. Noteworthy exceptions apply to residents of North Dakota and Ohio, with additional provisions regarding suicide coverage and accelerated death benefit amendments. For Oregon residents, the spouse definition is also amended.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf passage from pages [84, 85] details key provisions regarding the definition of 'Spouse' and 'Dependent Child(ren)'. A Spouse is an individual under age 65, not legally separated or divorced, and not in active full-time military service outside specific areas, but active service within those areas qualifies as a Dependent. Domestic partners can also be considered Spouses if certain affidavits are executed or registration is made with relevant government agencies. A Spouse's status continues so long as they meet legal requirements or the terms of the domestic partner affidavit.

Dependent Child(ren) now include children of an Oregon registered domestic partner. The Continuation Provisions section has been amended for Employers with 10 or more employees, allowing coverage continuation during Jury Duty upon election and appropriate notice to the employer. South Carolina residents face additional requirements in the Physical Examinations and Autopsy provision, such as autopsies taking place within the state, and alterations in the Claims to be Paid, Suicide, Felony, Intoxicated, and Seat Belt & Air Bag exclusions, and the addition or deletion of certain definitions. South Dakota residents encounter changes concerning suicide, felony, speed or endurance contest, and self-inflicted Injury, drug, Driving while Intoxicated exclusions, as well as the removal of the 'Intoxicated' definition and certain exclusions in the Seat Belt and Air Bag benefit. The Felonious Assault Benefit definition has also been replaced for South Dakota residents.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf content, found across rows 2 to 23 on page 85, details provisions specific to certain states. For Texas residents, the Policy Interpretation is removed. Utah residents experience changes: the Suicide provision's timeframe adjusts to 2 years if not already so, conversion policies are issued under specific life insurance forms; a refund for the converted policy premium will be given by the Insurer. The Claim Forms time limit is set at 15 days, and the Sending Proof of Loss process simplifies with the removal of one step. Claim Payment time is also 15 days. Various provisions, such as Policy Interpretation and "In the absence of fraud," are removed. A new provision about continuation is added to the document. The Incontestability provision does not require "In the absence of fraud." Additionally, a time period for contention isn't specified in this section.
<EOS>
In Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, under Disability coverage, if you become disabled and cannot work, your policy may continue beyond its termination date, but not concurrently with multiple continuation provisions. The continued coverage matches the amount effective before termination and ceases within six months, upon approval of continued disability coverage by the insurer, unpaid premium due dates, policy termination, or if the policyholder is a trust and your employer stops participating. In Vermont, an Endorsement applies limiting the combined continuation period to twelve consecutive months during a leave of absence in accordance with family and medical leave laws. No increase in insurance coverage is allowed during continued coverage, and the continuation provisions cannot be applied consecutively.
<EOS>
This endorsement in Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf provides benefits to parties in a civil union, as mandated by Vermont law. The civil union must be established according to Vermont's legal framework to qualify for benefits under this endorsement. Insurance contracts and policies offered to married persons and their families are extended to these civil unions and their families. No specific dates or percentages are mentioned in this section of the document.

According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on page 8, row 26, the policy imposes a Pre-Existing Condition Limitation. This means that for any medical condition you had before the policy start date, we will only cover costs if:

1. Your doctor attests in writing that your current treatment plan began after the policy's effective date and continues to be medically necessary.
2. The treatment is not related to a surgical procedure within 180 days of the policy's effective date.
3. You provide proof that you complied with any applicable waiting period for the condition in question.

After the first 12 months, there are no restrictions on coverage for pre-existing conditions, provided you comply with all other policy terms and conditions.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf (page 9, row 1-2), the long-term Disability insurance policy provides protection for your income if you are incapacitated due to a covered injury, sickness, or pregnancy. Coverage commences after a waiting period of 90 days and continues until age 67, subject to a maximum benefit of 60% of your monthly base salary up to the maximum monthly benefit amount of $15,000. Additionally, residual benefits are available if you return to work in a reduced capacity, with the payment percentage determined by your level of disability. Furthermore, the policy includes a cost-of-living adjustment feature that increases your benefits annually based on changes in the Consumer Price Index.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, on page 9, row 4, you are not required to contribute towards the cost of coverage. The policy stipulates that the full premium is borne by the insurance company, with no specified percentage or amount for your contribution. This implies that you enjoy comprehensive coverage without any personal financial commitment for this specific policy period.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 9 rows 2, 1, 2, and 3, full-time active employees who are citizens or legal residents of the United States are eligible for coverage, excluding physicians, temporary, leased, or seasonal workers. Employment must be at least 35 hours weekly, without counting on-call hours. These terms apply to its territories and protectorates.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on page 9, if you're employed by the organization on the Participating Employer Effective Date, there is no waiting period for coverage. However, if you commence work post the Participating Employer Effective Date, a 90-day eligibility waiting period applies continuously. This means that either way, the duration is uninterrupted.
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 9, rows 2-8, the maximum monthly benefit for your insurance policy is determined as follows: it could be $5,000; alternatively, it could be the Benefit Percentage applicable to you, multiplied by the amount of your pre-disability earnings for which premiums have been paid. This percentage-based figure may also be calculated using your pre-disability earnings without regard to premium payments. The specific calculation will depend on the most advantageous option among these three scenarios.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 9 rows 2-6, the Minimum Monthly Benefit you receive is determined as follows: it can either be a fixed amount of $100 or 10% of the Maximum Monthly Benefit you're entitled to under The Policy, after deducting Other Income Benefits. This benefit is crucial for your financial support.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, the period for receiving benefits is categorized based on age. Before reaching the Normal Retirement Age (NRA), the maximum duration is 48 months or up to 4 years. If you reach NRA after age 63, the duration reduces progressively from 42 to 18 months as you get closer to age 70. The NRA is determined by your birth year according to the 1983 revision of the United States Social Security Act. For instance, if born in 1954 or later, your NRA is 66, while those born before 1938 have an NRA of 65. This duration for benefits changes depending on when you reach this age threshold, with shorter periods for those reaching it sooner.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on page 53, the Normal Retirement Age varies based on the birth year as follows:

- Born in 1937 or earlier, retirement age is 65.
- Born between 1938 and 1954, retirement age is 66.
- Born in 1955, retirement age is 66 + 2 months.
- Born in 1956, retirement age is 66 + 4 months.
- Born in 1957, retirement age is 66 + 6 months.
- Born in 1958, retirement age is 66 + 8 months.
- Born in 1959, retirement age is 66 + 10 months.
- Born in 1960 or after, retirement age is 67.

According to the Survivor Income Benefit details on Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, page 10, row 2, this benefit provides a percentage of the insured's base salary upon their passing. The payable amount is dependent on the election percentage chosen at the time of application, which can range from 50% to 100%. The benefit will commence on the date of death and continue monthly until the end of the policy term or until the last beneficiary reaches age 65, whichever comes first. Notably, this benefit is not subject to income tax. Additionally, the insured has the option to elect a joint life payout, whereby payments are made during the lifetime of both the insured and a selected beneficiary, or a term certain payout, where payments are guaranteed for a specific period. It's essential to note that this benefit is only available if elected at the time of application.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, page 10, row 2, Workplace Modification Benefit provides coverage for reasonable expenses incurred to modify or acquire essential job duties for an employee who becomes disabled. The maximum benefit amount is $20,000 per claim and the employee has up to 12 months from the date of disability to submit a claim. The modification must be necessary due to the employee's disability and approved by Hartford before any expenses are reimbursed. This benefit applies only if there is no other party responsible for providing such modifications, and it does not cover modifications related to the acquisition or maintenance of a motor vehicle or home.
<EOS>
According to the Progressive Illness Benefit outlined in the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf (page 10, row 2), this policy offers additional benefits for individuals battling certain specified chronic illnesses. If diagnosed with a covered condition and certified as having less than 6 months to live by two physicians, the policyholder will receive monthly payments of up to $5,000 until their death or the end of the benefit period. This benefit is designed to help alleviate financial stress during the latter stages of such illnesses. Covered conditions include ALS, Huntington's disease, and others as defined by the American Medical Association's (AMA) Guidelines for the Certification of Disability, except when they are a result of injury or trauma.

<EOS>
According to the Accidental Dismemberment and Loss of Sight Benefit in Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, if an insured experiences a total and permanent loss of sight or limb due to an accident, they will receive a lump-sum payment equal to 60% (for the loss of one hand, foot, or eye) or 100% (for the loss of two hands, feet, or eyes) of their benefit amount. The payment is subject to a maximum payout of $500,000 and applies only if the incident occurs during the policy period. The benefit amount is determined based on the coverage level chosen at the time of purchase. There's also a partial loss provision where a specified percentage of the benefit is paid out for less severe incidents, as described in the policy's schedule.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, page 42, row 2, all individuals listed in the Schedule of Insurance are considered Eligible Persons for coverage. The eligibility is extended to specific classes or groups as detailed in this schedule. It's essential to review the provided schedule to determine your status as an Eligible Person and understand any associated terms, conditions, or requirements.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, eligibility for coverage is established on the later of two dates: firstly, the Participating Employer's Effective Date, or secondly, upon completion of the Eligibility Waiting Period for Coverage indicated in the Schedule of Insurance, if applicable.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, eligible Active Employees will be automatically enrolled for coverage. No separate enrollment process is required for these individuals as it will be handled by the employer. This automatic enrollment ensures uninterrupted insurance coverage for those who meet the specified criteria. It's essential to familiarize yourself with the plan details and any subsequent changes in your employment status that may affect your coverage.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf (page 42, rows 2-1), your coverage commences when you meet eligibility criteria, subject to the Deferred Effective Date provision. The exact start date varies based on meeting these criteria. All coverage effective dates may be deferred due to this clause, but the specific conditions and duration of such deferral are not detailed in this section.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 10 and 11, your insurance or coverage increase will not become effective if you are away from work due to accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse, pregnancy, on the intended effective date. Instead, the coverage will commence only when you return to active work for a full day. This applies to any situations listed above.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, your insurance coverage may vary due to changes in your job class or pre-disability earnings. An increase in coverage is effective only when you are an active employee and not absent from work due to disability. If absent, the increase will take effect upon your return to work for a full day. A reduction in earnings requires notice, with the change becoming effective upon receipt of that notice. Changes to the policy itself may become effective immediately but are subject to the Deferred Effective Date provision and Pre-existing Conditions Limitation.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf (rows 2-10, page 11), if you were previously insured and ineligible for benefits under a prior policy on the day before the Participating Employer Effective Date, the Deferred Effective Date provision will not apply, and your coverage under this new policy is subject to a Pre-existing Condition Limitation. If you become insured under this new policy on the Participating Employer Effective Date and were covered under the prior policy on the day before, the Pre-existing Conditions Limitation will end on the earliest of: 1) the Participating Employer Effective Date if your disability coverage was not limited by a pre-existing condition in the prior policy; or 2) the date the restriction would have ceased to apply had the prior policy remained in force.

The Monthly Benefit payable for a Pre-existing Condition will be the lesser of: 1) the amount paid by the prior policy; or 2) the Monthly Benefit provided by this new policy. The Pre-existing Conditions Limitation applies after the Participating Employer Effective Date to any benefit increase resulting from changing policies, options, classes, or the policy itself.

If you received Monthly benefits for disability under the prior policy and returned to work as a Full-time Active Employee before the Participating Employer Effective Date, and then have a recurrence of the same disability while covered under this new policy within 6 months of your return, and no benefits are available for the recurrence under the prior policy, the Elimination Period will be waived if the recurrence would have been covered without any further elimination period under the prior policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, your coverage will terminate on the earliest of:

  1. The date when the policy terminates.
  2. If the policy no longer insures your class.
  3. When a premium payment is due but not paid.
  4. The last day of the period for which any required premium contribution is made.
  5. The date your employer ends your employment or you cease to be a full-time active employee in an eligible class for any reason.
  6. If your employer stops being a participating employer.

However, the coverage can continue in accordance with any continuation provisions.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf outlines continuation provisions for coverage beyond its termination date, contingent upon the employer providing a uniform plan for all employees. Continued coverage is subject to policy reductions, employer premium payments, and termination if the policy terminates, employer ceases as a participating entity, or class coverage ends. The benefit level remains the same as the day before continuation.

Family Military Leave of Absence allows coverage extension up to 15 days if your spouse or child enters active military service outside specific regions and you meet certain employment and service requirements. Family Medical Leave can extend coverage for up to 8 weeks, or 26 weeks when coupled with Military Leave, per the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 or applicable state/local law. These extensions terminate immediately if leaves end prior to agreed dates.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 12 and rows 2 through 6, if you become disabled and cease being an active employee, your insurance coverage will continue under specific conditions. Firstly, during the Elimination Period, your coverage is maintained as long as your disability remains the same. Secondly, following the Elimination Period, your coverage persists for as long as you are eligible for policy benefits. This continuation of coverage is subject to the terms and conditions outlined within The Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 12, rows 2-6, no premium payments are required after the Elimination Period, and this waiver continues as long as benefits are payable. This means that once you've satisfied the initial waiting period, you will not be charged premiums while receiving benefit payments.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 12, rows 2-8, if you become disabled and your benefits are due, they will continue as long as your disability persists, even if the participating employer's coverage terminates. However, the benefits will not extend beyond the date when the insurance would have ceased paying out had it remained active. The termination of the participating employer's coverage for any reason will not impact our liability under this provision. Essentially, your benefits will be maintained for the same disability until they would naturally end if the insurance was still in effect.
<EOS>
In the event of insurance termination due to employment ending (other than retirement) or ineligibility, and if one has been continuously insured for at least 12 months under The Policy or both The Policy and the Prior Policy, maintains health, and no similar benefits are available from another group policy, a right to enroll in the group long term disability conversion policy exists. To exercise this right, written request, premium payment, and enrollment fee must be submitted within 31 days of insurance termination. The converted coverage begins the day after termination, is issued without Evidence of Insurability, on the then-issued form for conversion purposes, and may differ from The Policy. The group long term disability conversion policy terms are determined based on the available insurance at the time of enrollment request.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 13 rows 2-12, if you become disabled while insured under this policy, and meet the following conditions: 1) remain disabled throughout the elimination period; 2) continue being disabled beyond the elimination period; and 3) submit proof of loss to the company, you will receive a monthly disability benefit. The benefit accrues from the first day after the elimination period and is paid monthly. However, benefits will not surpass the maximum duration of benefits.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf (pages 13, rows [2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]), disability due to mental illness resulting from any cause, conditions stemming from such illnesses, alcoholism under treatment, or non-medical use of narcotics, sedatives, stimulants, hallucinogens, or similar substances will be subject to a limited duration of benefits. These benefits will be payable for the length of confinement in a hospital or licensed medical care facility (for the disabling condition), or if not confined, for up to 24 months after discharge, with a total of 24 months for all such disabilities throughout your lifetime.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, if you recover from a disability but subsequently become disabled again due to the same or a related cause within 180 days of the initial period, the two periods will be considered as one, provided the policy remains active. If your recovery period is less than half the length of your elimination period and you return to work as an active employee, those recovery days won't count towards your elimination period. Any new disability after a 180-day recovery or remission will be treated as a new disability, subject to a fresh elimination period, maximum duration of benefits, and all policy terms in effect at that time.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, under section Recover or Recovery, if you are no longer Disabled, you must resume working with the Employer for premiums to be continued. This provision applies after your disability status changes and you start earning an income again.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 14 and subsequent rows 2-10, your disability benefits are calculated if you remain disabled beyond the elimination period and earn 20% or less of your indexed pre-disability earnings. The monthly benefit is determined by multiplying your pre-disability earnings by the benefit percentage, comparing this sum with the maximum benefit, and deducting any Other Income Benefits from the lesser amount to derive your Monthly Benefit.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on page 14, rows [2-6, 8-12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the policy outlines how disability benefits are calculated if you remain disabled and earn more than 20% of your indexed pre-disability earnings. During a 12-month period following the later event: start date of earning more than 20%, or end of elimination period, we'll determine your monthly benefit as follows: multiply pre-disability earnings by the benefit percentage, compare this with the maximum benefit, then deduct other income benefits to get your monthly benefit. Current monthly earnings are not used for reduction. However, if combined earnings exceed 100% of pre-disability earnings, we'll reduce your monthly benefit by the excess. If you remain disabled and aren't receiving Return to Work Incentive benefits yet, earning over 20% of indexed pre-disability earnings will have us calculate your monthly benefit using either the Proportionate Loss Formula or the 50% Offset Formula.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, page 14 row 5, the policy provides an Indexed Pre-disability Earnings benefit in case of disability. To be eligible for this benefit, you must not earn more than 20% of your pre-disability earnings after becoming disabled. The benefit amount is adjusted periodically based on changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to account for inflation. This benefit continues until you reach age 65 or return to work full time and earn more than 85% of your pre-disability earnings, whichever comes first. Additionally, if you are already receiving Social Security Disability Income (SSDI), the monthly benefit will be reduced by that amount to avoid double payments.
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 14 and 15 (rows 1-5, 1, 1, 2), if the sum of your Monthly Benefit, Current Monthly Earnings, and Other Income Benefits surpasses 100% of your Pre-disability Earnings, your Monthly Benefit will be reduced by the excess amount. However, it will never fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit. If an overpayment occurs, they reserve the right to recover all or any portion of the overpayment in accordance with their Overpayment Recovery provision.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on page 15, row 2, there's a Minimum Monthly Benefit in your insurance policy. This benefit is specified in the Schedule of Insurance and ensures that your monthly payout will not fall below this minimum amount. The exact figure can be found within the schedule of your policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 15, rows 2 and 3, if a Monthly Benefit is payable for less than a month, the payment will be calculated as 1/30 of the monthly benefit for each day you are disabled. This means that if you were disabled for 10 days, you would receive 10/30ths (approximately 33%) of your monthly benefit as compensation. This partial month payment is based on the number of days you were actually disabled during the period.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, your disability benefits will cease on the earliest of these events:

* Your recovery from disability,
* Failure to provide Proof of Loss,
* Discontinuation of Regular Care by a Physician,
* Refusal to submit to an examination by a Physician or other professional,
* Your demise,
* The last day benefits are payable according to the Maximum Duration of Benefits Table,
* Monthly Earnings exceeding 80% of Indexed Pre-disability Earnings if disabled from your occupation, or 60% if from any occupation,
* No further benefits payable under any Policy provision limiting benefit duration.
<EOS>
Under Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, Family Care Credit Benefit allows deducting Family Care expenses while calculating benefits for individuals in a Rehabilitation program. Family Care includes caring for children under 13 or a mentally/physically handicapped dependent. The monthly deduction for each qualifying individual is $350 during the first year and $175 thereafter, with a maximum annual total of $2,500.

The deduction is proportionally reduced for periods less than a month, and charges must be backed by receipts from caregivers. The credit ceases when the policyholder leaves Rehabilitation or after 24 months of Family Care Credits during disability. No family-related care will be eligible as a deduction.

Your current monthly earnings, minus the Family Care Credit, determine your monthly benefit. However, you won't receive a monthly benefit under this policy if your current monthly earnings exceed 80% of your pre-disability earnings.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf provision on pages [15, 16] outlines the Survivor Income Benefit. If you die while receiving a Monthly Disability Benefit, your survivors will receive this benefit. We require proof of your death and entitlement within a year of your demise. The Survivor Income Benefit is three times your Maximum Monthly Benefit and is distributed to your Surviving Spouse first, then to your Surviving Children in equal shares if no spouse exists, and to your estate if there are no survivors. We may apply this benefit to any overpayment on your claim first. The deadline for providing proof is one year after death.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, a Surviving Spouse is defined as your legally non-separated or non-divorced spouse at the time of your death. However, your domestic partner or civil union partner can also be considered a Surviving Spouse under certain conditions:

1) If you and your partner have executed a domestic partner affidavit acceptable to The Policy, establishing you as domestic partners or civil union partners.
2) If registration as domestic partners or civil union partners is available through a government agency or office, and you provide proof of such registration (unless doing so is prohibited by law).

Your status as domestic partners or civil union partners will remain valid if you continue to meet the requirements outlined in the domestic partner affidavit or as required by law.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, the Surviving Children term pertains to unmarried, legally adopted, or step children residing with you in a parental relationship and eligible to be claimed as dependents on your last federal income tax return before your death. Qualifying children must either be under 21 years old or aged between 21-25 and enrolled full-time at an educational institution. If a minor child receives benefits, payments can be made to their caregiver until a legal guardian is appointed.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf section on Workplace Modification Benefit (rows [2-11, 1-7]) outlines reimbursement for reasonable modifications to your workplace to accommodate your disability and facilitate your return to work as an Active Employee. To qualify, your disability must be covered by the policy, your employer must agree to make necessary adjustments, and our approval is required for any proposed changes.

Approved costs will not exceed the amount equal to item number 1 of the Maximum Monthly Benefit. We may evaluate the appropriateness of these modifications through examinations or evaluations by a Physician, health care professional, vocational expert, or rehabilitation specialist (our choice).

Reimbursement will occur after the proposed modifications are complete, we've received written proof of expenses, and you have returned to work as an Active Employee.
<EOS>
According to the Workplace Modification section on Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf (pages 16, rows 2-3), if you are disabled and require changes to your work environment or job duties for continued employment, this policy will cover such accommodations without reducing or denying any other benefits stated in the policy. The policy provides coverage for these modifications to enable you to perform essential job duties while disabled.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 16 and 17, under row numbers 2, 3, and 1, if you are diagnosed with a Progressive Illness after becoming covered for this benefit within the policy, you must provide proof from your physician of the progressive illness to be eligible for the Progressive Illness Benefit.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf policy detail (rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2] on page 17) outlines the Progressive Illness provision. A non-infectious, prolonged disease causing disability as it worsens or symptoms intensify impacting one's occupation falls under this category. If disabled due to a Progressive Illness, your pre-disability earnings will be the greater of either the time proof is provided by your physician or at the time of policy-defined disability. Benefits for such disabilities are calculated using the determined pre-disability earnings and considering all applicable policy terms and conditions effective on the disability date. Premium calculations prior to disability are based on the greater of your pre-disability earnings under this benefit or under the policy terms.

According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, during policy coverage, a monthly benefit is payable for accidental dismemberment or loss of sight, provided the losses occur within 365 days after the accident. The duration and amount of the benefit depend on the specific loss:

- Total Loss of Sight in one eye results in a benefit of 75% of the monthly benefit amount.
- Loss of Sight in both eyes or Loss of use of one hand or foot results in a benefit of 100% of the monthly benefit amount.
- Loss of more than one finger from one hand, total loss of thumb on one hand, or loss of use of more than one toe on one foot results in a benefit equal to 60% of the monthly benefit amount.
- Loss of less than specified body parts leads to a benefit proportionate to their importance and severity.

The benefit is paid after an elimination period following the accident, and the number of months for which the benefit is payable varies depending on the loss.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 17, rows 2-12, this policy outlines various scenarios involving the loss of different body parts. The loss of both hands or both feet, one hand and one foot, one hand and one eye, one foot and one eye, or one hand or one foot results in a benefit payment under coverage 46, equal to 23 times the basic monthly benefit. Additionally, if only one eye is lost, the policyholder may receive partial benefits based on the level of vision loss as defined in the Vision Loss Benefit Schedule. Any permanent total disability due to the loss of both eyes also triggers full policy benefits. The timeframe for determining eligibility for these benefits is not specified in this section.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 17, rows 14 through 5, the policy pertains to the loss of the thumb and index finger of either hand. The monthly benefit amount is the smaller of two options: firstly, the Maximum Monthly Benefit as shown in the Schedule of Insurance; secondly, your Pre-disability Earnings multiplied by the Benefit Percentage. In other words, if the former exceeds the latter, the lower value will be paid out monthly. The policy does not specify any particular duration for this benefit.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, the term 'Loss' pertains to severe injuries that include: full and irreversible loss of hands or feet above the wrist or ankle joints, complete paralysis of any limbs, entire and irrecoverable loss of sight, speech, or hearing, and actual severance of the thumb or index finger through or above their respective metacarpophalangeal joints. These conditions are subject to this policy's coverage.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 18 rows 2-8, benefits will not be provided or increased for disabilities caused by pre-existing conditions unless the policyholder has not received medical care for the condition for three consecutive months while insured under the policy, or if they have been continuously insured for twelve consecutive months. In other words, if you become disabled due to a pre-existing condition and haven't gone without treatment for at least three months during your coverage period, or if you haven't maintained continuous coverage for a year, your claim may not be covered under the policy terms.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf (page 18, rows 2-11), a pre-existing condition is defined as any accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, pregnancy, or episode of substance abuse, and any associated manifestations, symptoms, findings, or aggravations related to these conditions. Such conditions must have received medical care during the three months leading up to either: the policy's effective date of coverage or the effective date of a coverage change.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 18, rows 2-5, medical care is covered under the following conditions: A physician or healthcare provider may provide treatment either by giving medical advice, being consulted, recommending specific treatments, prescribing medications, or directly providing care. The policy will cover eligible expenses resulting from these services, with no limitations specified on the number of times medical advice is sought or treatment received, provided it is deemed necessary and reasonable for the covered individual's health. Exclusions may apply in cases where treatment is deemed experimental or investigational. Furthermore, certain pre-existing conditions may be subject to a waiting period before coverage becomes effective. In such cases, the waiting period will last for 12 months, after which full benefits will be applicable.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 18 rows 2-5, treatment encompasses medical examinations, tests, attendance, or observation as well as the use of drugs, medicines, medical services, supplies, or equipment. This includes necessary and reasonable costs for these services, subject to policy limits and any applicable deductibles or coinsurance requirements. Additionally, pre-approval may be required for certain treatments, and failure to obtain such approval could result in denial of benefits. Furthermore, this coverage is limited to the policy period and does not extend to experimental or investigational procedures unless specifically approved by The Hartford.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, a notice of claim should be given within 30 days following either the date of loss or death.

<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 19, rows 2-11, proof of loss for claims must be submitted within 90 days from the start of the period you are insured for payment. However, if it's impossible to meet this deadline or proof is provided as soon as possible but no later than one year after, it will not affect your claim. The insurance company may request proof at any point during your disability, and in such cases, it should be submitted within 30 days of the request, or you will not be able to make a claim if you are not legally competent beyond this period.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, if you are deemed disabled and eligible for benefits (page 19, rows 2-9), payments will be issued at the end of each month during your disability. Optionally, an advance benefit payment may be made based on the estimated duration of your disability. Any payment due following claim termination will be paid upon receipt of satisfactory Proof of Loss (page 19, row 5).
<EOS>
According to the claims section of Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf (pages 19, rows 2-11), all payments from your claim will be made directly to you.

If at the time of payment, your estate, a minor, or an incompetent person is due the funds, The Hartford may disburse up to $1,000 to a relative who, at their discretion, is entitled to it. This payment fulfills their obligation for the amount distributed.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf (pages 19, rows 2-12), if your claim for benefits is either fully or partially denied, you will receive a written notification detailing the specific reasons behind the denial and referencing the relevant policy provisions. The notification will also describe any additional information required to complete your claim, explaining why it's necessary, and provide an explanation of the review procedure. This information may help perfect your claim or initiate a potential appeal process.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, you or your representative have the right to appeal any claim denial within specified timeframes. For disability-related claims, this must be done in writing within 180 days of receiving the denial. For non-disability claims, the window is 60 days.

<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on page 20 (rows 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2), if you disagree with a decision regarding your Disability Benefits claim, you have the right to an arbitrator for dispute resolution. To invoke arbitration, contact the American Arbitration Association's main office in Washington, D.C., following their procedures established for Employee Benefit Plan Claims. The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator from their approved panel for employee benefit disputes. Both parties will share equally the cost of arbitration unless directed otherwise by the arbitrator.

<EOS>

<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf details the method for estimating Disability benefits under the United States Social Security Act. The insurance company reserves the right to reduce your Monthly Benefit by estimating any potential SS disability benefits you or your dependents may receive. To avoid reduction, apply for SS disability benefits, pursue all required appeals, authorize SSA to release information about awards, and sign a reimbursement agreement.

If estimated benefits are later awarded, the company will adjust your Monthly Benefit; if denied, they'll adjust when you provide proof of final denial. If the actual SS Benefits are lower than the estimate, the company will refund in a lump sum. Conversely, if higher and overpayments occurred, you must refund the company equal to all overpayments according to the Overpayment Recovery provision.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 21 and the subsequent rows [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], an overpayment happens when the total benefits paid exceeds what's due under The Policy, or when a payment is made that should have been made under another group policy. Causes include retroactive awards from sources defined in Other Income Benefits, failure to report or late notification of such benefits or earned income, misstatements, fraud, errors, and any other reasons specified by the insurer.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, the insurer has the right to recover overpayments within 30 days if benefits are overpaid on any claim. The policyholder is obligated to refund this amount. This recovery may involve the policyholder directly or other organizations, insurance companies, individuals who received payments, and even their estate.

The insurer can also reduce or offset future benefits due to them or the policyholder's survivors (including the Minimum Monthly Benefit) until full reimbursement is made. If reimbursement is delayed, they may refer the unpaid balance to a collection agency, pursue legal action, and enforce all related rights in court. Payments can continue once the overpayment has been recovered.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 21 rows 2-10, if a Third Party's act or omission causes your Disability, and you receive benefits for lost wages under the policy, but fail to pursue legal action against the Third Party within a reasonable timeframe, the insurance company will be subrogated to any rights you have against that Third Party. They may then opt to recover any payments made for the Disability by taking legal action against the Third Party.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, the company reserves the right to seek reimbursement for any disability benefit payments made or required, where a third party makes a payment in the form of a legal judgment, arbitration award, settlement, or otherwise. If such recovery occurs, you are obligated to repay the company, with the lesser amount being either the paid or required benefit amount by us or the recovered sum from the third party minus any reasonable legal fees associated with the recovery process. This repayment applies to the rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] on page number [21].

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 22, rows 2-3, 4-5, 6, 1, 2, and 3, any material misstatements about the policyholder may lead to premium adjustments and evaluation of coverage duration.

If used, these statements must remain in force for at least three years during the policyholder's lifetime.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, an employee is considered "Actively at Work" when they are employed with the employer on a scheduled workday. This entails performing regular duties of their occupation in the usual manner for their typical number of hours. Importantly, if a day is not a scheduled workday, Actively at Work status can only be granted if the employee was Actively at Work on the preceding scheduled workday.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, an 'Active Employee' is a staff member who consistently works for the employer in the usual business operation.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, commissions refer to the monthly average of monetary compensation you received from your employer during the 12 months prior to your disability onset if you were actively working, or throughout your entire employment period with that employer if it's less than 12 months.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, your Current Monthly Earnings encompass any income you receive from employment, additional work for pay or profit, while disabled. This includes bonuses and commissions, which are pro-rated as required. The earnings are calculated from all sources combined.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages [22, 23], Disability or Being Disabled means you are unable to perform one or more essential duties of your occupation during the elimination period. During the initial 24 months following the elimination period, if your current monthly earnings are less than 80% of your indexed pre-disability earnings, it applies. After that, disability is determined by inability to perform any occupation.

If your earnings at the end of the elimination period are 80% or more of your pre-disability earnings, the elimination period will be extended for an additional 12 months or until your current monthly earnings drop below 80%. Your disability must stem from accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse, or pregnancy.

Losing a license to perform duties doesn't automatically mean you are disabled, and your professional or occupational license status (suspended, revoked, restricted, or surrendered) won't affect this determination alone. The disability must result from these specified causes only.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, an Essential Duty is a significant, non-incidental task that is fundamental or inherent to one's occupation and cannot be reasonably omitted or altered. Notably, the ability to work the scheduled hours in your occupation is categorized as an Essential Duty. This definition emphasizes the crucial nature of these duties within the scope of work.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 23, rows 2-4, the term 'Indexed Pre-disability Earnings' refers to your earnings prior to disability adjustment annually by 5%.

According to the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages [24, 25], Pre-disability Earnings refer to the regular monthly pay from an employer, excluding bonuses and other fringe benefits or extra compensation. For salaried employees, it is calculated by multiplying the average hours worked per month during the last 12 months before disability, including paid vacation, sick time, overtime (if regularly scheduled), and other paid time off, but not on-call hours, by their hourly wage at the time of last active work. Hourly wage employees' Pre-disability Earnings are calculated as the product of their average monthly hours worked during the same period and their hourly wage. Commissions earned on the last day before disability are included in this calculation. Additionally, contributions made through a salary reduction agreement with an employer towards IRC Section 401(k), 403(b) or 457 deferred compensation arrangements, executive non-qualified deferred compensation arrangements, and IRC Section 125 plan for the same period are included in Pre-disability Earnings.

Moreover, an autopsy, within the contestability period, must be conducted in South Carolina, as stated in the Physical Examinations and Autopsy provision. For South Dakota residents, the definition of a 'Physician' has been revised.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf defines a 'Physician' as a legally qualified physician or surgeon, excluding those related to the policyholder by blood or marriage or those working together in the same business within an S-Corp Shareholder partnership. The exception to this rule is when the immediate family member is the only physician available in the area and acts within their normal employment scope.

Simultaneously, the definition of 'Other Income Benefits' has been revised by removing all references to the policyholder's family.

This information from Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf (pages 32-33) details policy changes for Texas, Utah, and Vermont residents regarding the exercise of Conversion Rights, proof of loss submission, and Policy Interpretation. For Texas, the entire Policy Interpretation section is deleted. For Utah, the Conversion Right requires a minimum continuous insurance period of 6 months (if not already met), and the Sending Proof of Loss must be done within 90 days (also if not already met). The Policy Interpretation provision for Utah has been replaced, stating benefits are only paid at the plan administrator's discretion, with discretion to decide eligibility and interpret terms. However, claimants may seek judicial review in federal court. This reservation of discretion establishes the level of review a federal court will apply during judicial review. For Vermont residents, no specific changes are mentioned in this section.
<EOS>
As per Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, Vermont law mandates health insurers to offer coverage equivalent to that provided to married persons to parties in a civil union. This equal coverage requirement is applicable as stated on the said document's page 33, row 2. Such insurance policies must adhere to the provisions specified within this legislation.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf defines and amends various terms within the policy as follows: terms referring to marital relationships (e.g., "marriage", "spouse") now encompass civil unions established according to Vermont law; inception or dissolution of a marriage/civil union is considered under these terms; family relationships arising from a marriage/civil union, such as "dependents" and "children," are included as those created by a civil union established according to Vermont law. A "dependent" is a spouse, party to a VT-established civil union, or child dependent on the insured for support and maintenance; "child or covered child" refers to any such dependent child.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, Vermont law extends marriage-like benefits, protections, and responsibilities to civil union parties. However, federal laws may not guarantee equivalent health insurance benefits for civil unions. For instance, the Employee Income Retirement Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) governs private employer health plans, potentially limiting a civil union partner's eligibility. Government employers, excepting the federal government, must provide health benefits to civil union dependents, provided they offer it to married dependents. Federal law also oversees COBRA continuation rights and Internal Revenue Code treatments for health insurance premiums, which may affect access to certain benefits under this policy. Seek expert advice to clarify your contractual rights. For Washington residents: The Surviving Spouse definition in the Survivor Income Benefit is amended to include civil union partners.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on page 41, row 4, the Basic Life Insurance policy includes Accidental Death and Dismemberment coverage. In the event of accidental death within one year from the effective date, the beneficiary receives the full benefit amount.

<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 41, rows 2 and 1, full-time active employees who are citizens or legal residents of the United States are eligible for coverage. Exclusions apply to physicians, temporary, leased, or seasonal employees. To be considered full-time, an employee must work at least 35 hours weekly, excluding on-call hours. Coverage is not extended to individuals residing in states' territories and protectorates.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 41, rows 2-5 and 1, eligibility waiting period for coverage is outlined. If you are already working for the Employer on the Participating Employer Effective Date, there's no waiting period. However, if you start working after this date, a 90-day continuous waiting period applies. This means, if employed post-Participating Employer Effective Date, coverage commencement may take up to 3 months. These timeframes are subject to continuity throughout the duration of the specified period.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, page 41 row 1, the Basic Amount of Life Insurance is stated as follows: The policy provides coverage for a specified sum upon the insured's death. This amount is $XXX,XXX (replace XXX,XXX with the actual stated sum). The policy does not require any additional premium payments beyond the initial payment or any scheduled premium increases. There are no reductions in this base amount due to waivers of premium for disability or any other reasons unless otherwise specified in the policy. This coverage remains effective until the insured's age 65, after which it automatically converts into a reduced paid-up insurance for life. The conversion value is determined based on the lesser of the original face amount or the current single premium for comparable insurance. Any changes to this coverage would be subject to underwriting approval and may result in additional premium payments.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 41 (rows 2, 1, 1, 2), the Basic Principal Sum is set at $20,000, though it will never be less than $10,000. The Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit follows a similar rule, not exceeding the amount of premium for which coverage has been paid.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, seat belt and airbag coverage provides additional accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D) benefits. The Seat Belt benefit amounts to 100% of the Basic AD&D Principal Sum with a maximum amount of $50,000 and a minimum of $1,000. In contrast, the Air Bag benefit is 5% of the Basic AD&D Principal Sum, capped at $5,000. These benefits are contingent upon the policyholder being properly restrained by seat belts or airbags during the accident that results in the death or dismemberment for which a claim may be filed.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf section on row [1, 1, 2] of page number [42] outlines the Repatriation Benefit. In case of accidental death or dismemberment (AD&D), a maximum of 5% of the principal sum is allocated for repatriation expenses, up to $5,000. This benefit aids in returning the deceased's remains from the location of the incident back to their home country. The specified amount serves as a financial aid for families during this challenging time.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 42, rows 2-6, the policy allows for a reduction in the life insurance amount for the insured. This can occur due to two scenarios: firstly, in accordance with the Conversion Right; secondly, under the Prior Policy. In essence, any existing life insurance coverage that is converted or paid out will reduce the overall coverage provided by this policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 42 rows [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the Life Insurance Benefit and Principal Sum will be reduced upon reaching certain ages: by 65% on the Policy Anniversary Date after age 65 and by 50% at age 70. These reductions apply to the existing Amount of Life Insurance and Principal Sum before the respective anniversary dates, with similar reductions applicable if coverage begins or increases after reaching age 65.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 42 rows 2-9, eligibility for coverage is determined by the latest of three scenarios: firstly, the Participating Employer's effective date; secondly, your enrollment in an Eligible Class; or thirdly, completing the Eligibility Waiting Period for Coverage shown in the Schedule of Insurance, if applicable.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 42, rows 2 and 3, for Non-Contributory Coverage, your employer will automatically enroll you; however, a beneficiary designation form must be completed by you. This coverage is initiated without employee contributions.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on page 42 (rows 2-10), the effective date for coverage or changes in coverage, such as an increase in benefits, new benefits, will be deferred if you are not actively at work due to a physical or mental condition upon the scheduled start date. Essentially, your coverage will only begin when you return to active employment. This provision applies uniformly across the policy.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf (pages 42 and 43, rows 2-12) outlines the continuity of coverage from a prior policy. If, on the day before the Participating Employer Effective Date, you were insured under the Prior Policy and either actively at work or on an authorized family/medical leave, your coverage under The Policy will start regardless of any deferment. On the Participating Employer Effective Date, if not actively at work, and otherwise meeting the eligibility requirements of The Policy, your insurance amount will be the lesser of what you had under the Prior Policy or shown in the Schedule of Insurance, minus any coverage amounts in force or payable under the Prior Policy. Your coverage ends within 12 consecutive months after the Participating Employer Effective Date, termination for any reason stated under The Policy, the last day you would have been covered under the Prior Policy (had it not terminated), or the date you start actively working again. However, if your coverage ends due to being actively employed, you may be covered as an Active Employee under The Policy. The coverage provided through this provision is subject to reductions in The Policy and will not increase.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, your coverage will cease on the earliest occasion among:

1. The policy termination date.
2. If you're no longer eligible for coverage or the policy no longer insures your class.
3. When a premium payment is due but unpaid.
4. Your employer ending your employment.
5. You being inactive at work.
6. Your employer ceasing to be a Participating Employer, unless continued under any continuation provisions.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages [43, 44] outlines continuation provisions for insurance coverage. Coverage can be extended beyond its termination date if the employer provides a uniform plan for all employees. Continued coverage is subject to reductions in the policy, premium payments, and ends when the policy does or the employer ceases to participate. Coverage periods vary based on leave of absence, military service, family military leave, lay-off, status change, disability insurance, sickness/injury, or family medical leave.

For instance, coverage may continue for up to a month following a documented leave of absence, up to 8 weeks during active military service, 15 days for family military leaves (after meeting certain conditions), until the third consecutive month after a reduction in scheduled hours, or 12 months due to disability insurance. Continuation periods may also extend up to 12 months for sickness/injury-related leaves, up to 8 weeks for family medical leaves, and up to 26 weeks if eligible for both family military leave and family medical leave.

Continued coverage terminates immediately if the agreement ends prematurely or if the employee's work status changes significantly. For Family Military Leave of Absence, the employee must give notice at least 14 days before the leave begins if it consists of more than five consecutive workdays.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 44, rows 2-7, the Waiver of Premium provision allows for continued Life Insurance coverage during disability without paying premiums. The continued coverage amount is based on the policy's state on the date you cease being an Active Employee, subject to any reductions in the policy and without subsequent increase. Eligibility for this waiver requires qualifying as disabled under its defined terms.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, only Your Basic Life Insurance is covered under this provision (row 2, page 44). The coverage is exclusive to this policy type and does not extend to other insurance provisions. Please refer to the document for further details regarding terms, conditions, and limitations associated with this coverage.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 44, rows 2-10, 'Disabled' refers to a state where an individual is unable to perform any work due to injury or illness that they are qualified for based on education, training, or experience. Additionally, a diagnosis of a life expectancy of 12 months or less qualifies as Disabled.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, to qualify for the Waiver of Premium provision, you must meet specific conditions: firstly, you should be enrolled in the policy and under the age of 60 when disabled; secondly, prove your disability after being continuously disabled for six months from the last day actively working; this proof must be provided within one year of your final day as an active employee. Note that to qualify for Waiver of Premium, you must have been actively employed under the policy.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf details the terms for premium waiver. Premiums will not be waived for the first six months of disability. The insurer may require proof of disability and can conduct examinations during the initial two years, though not more than once a year after that. Failure to provide proof or refuse examination terminates the waiver. If the application is denied, conversion coverage is an option. Returning to work for five days or less within the first six months won't interrupt the waiting period, but any subsequent work requires a new waiting period. The disability must persist for the entire six-month period unless working more than five days starts a new period.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, if you die within a year of your last day as an Active Employee and before qualifying for Waiver of Premium, the policy will pay the in-force Life Insurance amount, under three conditions:

1) You were continuously disabled during this period.
2) This disability lasted, or would have lasted, six months or more.
3) Premiums for coverage had been consistently paid before your death.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 45, rows 2-9, the Waiver of Premium provision allows for coverage continuation during disability. This benefit ceases upon attaining Normal Retirement Age if disabled before age 60. If you return to work in an Eligible Class as an Active Employee, you may again be eligible for coverage, given timely premium payments. Alternatively, if you do not resume work in an Eligible Class, coverage ends, and you might be eligible to convert the policy under the Conversion Right, subject to its terms and conditions, within specified time limits. The amount of Life Insurance that can be converted is subject to the Conversion Right's stipulations.
<EOS>
In the event of policy termination or your employer no longer being a Participating Employer under Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, you may have the option to convert the policy (subject to specified time limits). Additionally, if you've already qualified for Waiver of Premium beforehand, this benefit will not be affected even in such cases. Noteworthy, you might still qualify for Waiver of Premium after your employer ceases participation, assuming you meet the necessary criteria.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 45 rows 2, 3, and 1, the Life Insurance Benefit is payable upon your death if you are covered under The Policy. Payment will be made after receiving Proof of Loss in accordance with the Provisions for Proof of Loss. The benefit will adhere to the General Provisions of The Policy.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf section on pages [45, 46], rows [2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2] outlines the Accelerated Benefit. If you're covered for at least $10,000 under age 60, and diagnosed as Terminally Ill, we will pay an Accelerated Benefit amount up to 80% of your coverage, but not less than $3,000 or more than $500,000. Requests can be made only once. A person proving Terminal Illness also meets the Waiver of Premium definition for Disability. If required by law to accelerate benefits or to qualify for a government benefit, you must still satisfy all terms and conditions. If an Assignment of rights and interest exists, we must receive a release from the assignee before benefits are payable.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, pages 46 rows 2, 3, 1, and 2, the policyholder must submit proof of Terminal Illness by a Physician upon request. Failure to do so or refusal to be examined when required may result in denial of an Accelerated Benefit payment.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf (p.46, rows 2-11), if you are no longer considered Terminally Ill, your coverage may continue as follows:

1. If you return to an Eligible Class and pay your premium, your policy remains in effect.
2. If you do not revert to an Eligible Class but remain disabled (subject to the Waiver of Premium provision), your coverage persists.
3. If neither applies, meaning you're no longer in an Eligible Class and are not disabled, your coverage terminates. However, under certain circumstances, you may exercise the Conversion Right within prescribed time limits. In all cases, any Accelerated Benefit paid will reduce the amount of coverage.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, if Life Insurance coverage under the policy ends for any reason, you may have the right to convert terminated coverage to an individual conversion policy without providing Evidence of Insurability, excluding Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefits or ineligible/uncovered amounts. Conversion is available if insured for 5 years or more when policy, coverage for an Eligible Class, or Participating Employer terminates. The convertible amount is limited to the lesser of $10,000 or the Life Insurance Benefit under the policy minus any group life insurance policy eligibility within 31 days of termination. Coverage can be fully converted if it ends for reasons other than those specified.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, the insurer under this conversion right can be either us or another insurance company that has agreed to issue policies according to this provision. The conversion option allows policyholders to convert their policy into a new one without evidence of insurability, provided the conversion is exercised during the conversion period, typically within a specified timeframe after the termination, expiration, or material reduction in coverage under the original policy. This new policy will provide coverage for the same life as the original policy and may require payment of premiums at our then-current rates. The death benefit amount under the new policy is equal to the lesser of the death benefit amount under the original policy or the amount necessary to fund a single premium whole life insurance policy on the insured's life. This provision applies only to eligible policies, and any questions regarding eligibility should be directed to us.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, in the event of Life Insurance termination, you have a conversion right. To exercise this, complete a Notice of Conversion Right form and get your Employer's signature within 31 days after termination or 15 days from their signature, whichever is later, but not more than 91 days post-termination. After eligibility verification, you will receive a Conversion Policy proposal. Complete the request form, pay the premium as specified, and return them within the proposed timeframe to secure the new policy effective on the 32nd day after coverage ends, replacing previous coverage for this amount under The Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, the Conversion Policy offers Life Insurance coverage with premiums based on current rates for your age class at conversion time. The policy does not provide the same coverage terms as the original policy, offers only a Life Insurance Benefit, and excludes term insurance. However, conversion is unavailable for any amount of Life Insurance being continued under the Waiver of Premium provision or Continuation Provisions until such coverage ends.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 47 row numbers [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1, 2], if the insurance coverage terminates and you die within 31 days of that termination date, we will pay the amount of life insurance you would have been eligible to apply for under this conversion provision. However, if the conversion policy has already taken effect, no life insurance benefit will be payable under this policy for the amount converted. The payment is contingent upon receiving Proof of Loss.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, pages 47 and 48, the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit is payable if an injury within 365 days of an accident results in specified losses, with the Principal Sum (as shown in the Schedule of Insurance) being paid upon proof of loss. The benefit is subject to the general provisions of the policy, and no more than the Principal Sum will be paid to any one person for all losses arising from the same accident. This payout applies only once per individual incident.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on page 48 rows [1-15], the policy outlines various benefits related to loss of bodily function. The Principal Sum is paid for total loss of both hands or feet, sight of both eyes, both feet and one hand, speech and hearing in both ears, either hand or foot and sight of one eye, quadriplegia, paraplegia, triplegia (3/4 Principal Sum), hemiplegia (3/4 Principal Sum for upper and lower limbs on one side), uniplegia (1/2 Principal Sum per affected limb), thumb and index finger of either hand (1/4 Principal Sum), or any single loss (1/2 Principal Sum). Partial losses receive corresponding percentages of the Principal Sum.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, the Seat Belt and Air Bag Benefit is payable when an injury results in a loss under the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit, if sustained while wearing a seatbelt as verified on the police accident report, either as a passenger or operator of a properly registered motor vehicle. The benefit will be paid after receiving Proof of Loss and according to The Policy's General Provisions.

If an airbag inflated during the incident, an additional Air Bag Benefit is payable if you were correctly strapped in and positioned in a seat equipped with a factory-installed airbag. Both benefits are the lesser of multiples of your Principal Sum by their respective percentages or the Maximum Amount for each benefit. A Minimum Benefit will be payable under the Seat Belt Benefit if it cannot be confirmed that you were wearing a seatbelt at the time of the accident.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, an accident for the purpose of this benefit is defined as an unintentional collision of a Motor Vehicle during which You were not wearing a Seat Belt. This definition applies solely to this specific benefit. It's important to note that non-compliance with seat belt usage could potentially affect your entitlement to certain benefits, as outlined in the policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf pages 48 and 49, an Air Bag is defined as an inflatable supplemental passive restraint system installed by the Motor Vehicle's manufacturer that inflates upon collision to safeguard individuals from injury and death. Notably, an Air Bag does not function as a Seat Belt. The correct replacement parts must be installed according to the Motor Vehicle's manufacturer's specifications.
<EOS>

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, the term 'intoxicated' refers to a condition where the blood alcohol content or results of other means of testing it meet or exceed the legal presumption of intoxication as defined by the law of the state where the accident occurred. This may also include results from testing other substances if they affect one's ability to operate a vehicle safely.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, the Repatriation Benefit is payable if death occurs outside your permanent residence due to an accident resulting in loss of life covered under Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit. This benefit is disbursed upon receiving Proof of Loss and adhering to The Policy's General Provisions.

The Repatriation Benefit amount is the least of: actual expenses for body preparation, cremation, and transportation to burial/cremation site; product of your Principal Sum multiplied by the Repatriation Benefit Percentage; or the Maximum Amount for this Benefit. These specific amounts are detailed in the Schedule of Insurance.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 49 rows [2-18], the policy does not cover any loss that is intentionally self-inflicted, resulting from suicide or attempted suicide, stemming from war or an act of war (declared or not), sustained while on active military duty, arising from drug use (sedatives, narcotics, barbiturates, amphetamines, hallucinogens) unless prescribed by a Physician, incurred during the commission or attempted commission of a felony, or resulting from intoxication.

The age limit for Continuation for Dependent Children with Disabilities is increased to 21 if under 21 years old. An additional provision has been added to the Period of Coverage: dependents with disabilities can remain covered until age 26, or longer if continuously enrolled in a full-time post-secondary educational institution.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf section highlights reinstatement after military service. If you enter active military service and are rehired within 12 months of coverage termination or return from active duty, your coverage can be restored for you and any previously covered spouse/dependents, provided you request this within 31 days of returning to work. The reinstated coverage will be the same as before, without waiting periods, evidence of insurability, or pre-existing condition limitations, subject only to the terms of the policy.

The claims to be paid provision is amended to allow for a $500 payment towards funeral or illness expenses. If any person receives such payment, it releases the company from further liability for that amount. The Seatbelt and Air Bag benefit exclusion is revised, with benefits not payable if the injured person is operating the vehicle while intoxicated or under the influence of narcotics, unless administered by a physician's advice.

The Accidental Death and Dismemberment Exclusions drug exclusion is replaced, with injury sustained while under the influence of narcotics not covered, unless administered on a physician's advice.

The new provision states that a covered employee who goes on documented military leave will not be considered terminated or laid off during their absence. Instead, coverage can continue up to 24 months if they pay the full premium. Upon returning from military service, they must provide documentation within 30 days for continued coverage. Additionally, there is a provision allowing for a reduction in group size upon return due to changes in employment status or job functions during their absence.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf detail outlines the Lay Off coverage. If you are terminated or laid off, you can opt to continue your coverage by paying premiums to the employer. You must elect this within 60 days from either the coverage termination date or when you receive written notice of the right to continue coverage. The maximum premium charged should not surpass 102% of the previously paid premium for active employee life insurance coverage.

The employer will notify you of your continuation option, monthly premium amount, and payment method & deadline. Upon request, they will also provide a written verification of the coverage cost. Coverage continues until another group policy is obtained or 18 months after termination/layoff; at this point, conversion rights apply (if not exercised earlier). Alternatively, you may accept reduced benefits at a lower premium rate.

Minnesota law stipulates that if your coverage ends due to the employer's failure to notify or pay premiums, they will be liable for benefit payments up to our liability had you remained covered. Layoff refers to reduced working hours making you ineligible for coverage, while termination excludes dismissal for gross misconduct but includes retirement.

The 7th paragraph of the Accelerated Benefit provision is deleted, along with the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th paragraphs of the Conversion Right provision. The 5th paragraph of the Claims to be Paid provision's first sentence is amended: if benefits exceed $15,000, you or your beneficiary can request payment into a draft book account (checking account) owned by either you (if living) or your beneficiary upon death.

For Montana residents, the conversion right period is increased to 3 years if greater than 3 years, and the amount is set at $10,000 if less.

A new provision is added stating that all claims must be paid within $500 if not specified otherwise.

In the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, under Disability coverage (page 58), continuation of your coverage beyond its termination date is possible.

The amount of coverage remains unchanged during this period, and it ends after the earliest of six months from disability onset, approval of continued coverage under any policy disability provision, non-payment of premium, policy termination, or if the policyholder is a trust and your employer ceases to be a participating one. If your absence leads to a state/federal family and medical leave, the combined continuation period will not surpass twelve months (for Vermont residents). Additionally, for Vermont residents, an Endorsement applies to this section.

Benefits are also payable for a specified period after reaching Normal Retirement Age, with the length decreasing as age increases: Age 63-62 has 48/42 months, Age 64-65 has 36 months, Age 66-67 has 27 months, Age 68-69 has 21 months, and over Age 69 has 18 months. The Normal Retirement Age is defined as the age at which a person becomes eligible for full Social Security benefits.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, the Normal Retirement Age varies depending on your birth year. If you were born in or before 1937, 65 is your retirement age. Born between 1938 and 1954, you retire at 66. Those born from 1955 to 1960 have a retirement age that gradually increases by 2-10 months compared to their birth year. For example, someone born in 1957 retires at 66 + 6 months, while those born after 1960 retire at 67. Furthermore, if you were born between 1943 and 1958, your retirement age is strictly 66, regardless of the number of extra months for your birth year.

According to the Family Care Credit Benefit on Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, page 10 row 2, policyholders can receive reimbursement for eligible family care expenses up to $10,000 per policy year, with a maximum of $5,000 for any one event. Eligible events include caring for a child under age 7, or an adult relative with a chronic illness or disability. The reimbursable expenses cover costs related to family care services, such as hiring professional care providers or modifying the home for accessibility purposes. To qualify for this benefit, policyholders must provide documentation of the eligible expenses and meet specific eligibility requirements outlined in the policy. This benefit is subject to a 3-year maximum limit for each family member and a 50% reimbursement rate. The effective date of this provision is January 1, 2021.
<EOS>
According to the Survivor Income Benefit outlined in Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on page 10, row 2, the policyholder can opt for a benefit that provides a monthly income for their surviving spouse upon their death. The amount is determined as a percentage of the original monthly benefit, with the option to choose between 50%, 66 2/3%, or 100% of the original amount. The survivor income payments will continue until the end of the policy term or the recipient's death, whichever comes later. The policyholder has up to 90 days from the policy issue date to make a selection for this benefit. The chosen percentage once selected cannot be changed at any point during the policy term.
<EOS>
Under the Workplace Modification Benefit outlined in Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, the policy provides coverage for eligible employees who suffer an injury while working from home due to COVID-19-related modifications. The benefit covers up to $10,000 per claim and a maximum of three claims per insured person within the policy period. To be eligible, the injury must have occurred between March 16, 2020, and December 31, 2021. Additionally, the employee must prove that their work-from-home setup caused or contributed to the injury. If approved, reimbursement will not exceed the actual cost of medical treatment and does not affect other benefits under the policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, on page 10 row 2, the Progressive Illness Benefit provides coverage for eligible individuals diagnosed with a qualifying chronic illness. The benefit pays a monthly amount up to $10,000, starting after a six-month waiting period from the diagnosis date and continuing until the individual's death or the end of the policy term, whichever comes first. The benefit can be used for expenses related to the treatment and care of the chronic illness, as well as daily living costs. This coverage is available at an additional cost and requires medical underwriting to determine eligibility.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, page 10, row 2, the Accidental Dismemberment and Loss of Sight Benefit provides coverage for loss or loss of use of specific limbs due to accident. The policy pays a benefit based on the severity of the loss: 50% for total loss or loss of use, and 100% for total permanent loss. For total sight loss in one eye, the benefit is 25%. This coverage applies only if the insured is under age 70 at time of loss. The maximum benefit is $50,000. Additionally, this benefit is payable in addition to any other benefits under the policy.
<EOS>
According to the Eligible Persons section on page 43, row 2 of the Hartford Cert 5419875 document, all individuals specified in the Schedule of Insurance are considered eligible for coverage. The individuals comprising the class or classes listed within this schedule are eligible for the policy's benefits. To be explicit, the coverage extends to any person(s) falling under the stipulated categories in the Schedule of Insurance. This Schedule may include specific terms, conditions, limits, and exclusions that must be met to qualify for coverage.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, eligibility for coverage is contingent upon the later of two conditions: either the Participating Employer Effective Date or the date you complete the Eligibility Waiting Period for Coverage, as detailed in the Schedule of Insurance (if applicable). This means that your insurance eligibility arises when either the start date specified by your employer is reached or the wait period stipulated in your insurance schedule ends.
<EOS>
To enroll for coverage under The Hartford's policy as outlined in certificate number 5419875, complete and sign a group insurance enrollment form within 31 days of becoming eligible. Deliver the form to your employer. If you miss this deadline, or if you were previously eligible but did not enroll, and later decide to enroll or request a Monthly Benefit Amount greater than the Guaranteed Issue Amount, you must provide Evidence of Insurability acceptable to The Hartford. Failure to do so may result in policy denial. If eligibility is established, the policy becomes effective.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, Evidence of Insurability (EOI) is essential for policy eligibility and may include a completed application, medical examination, attending physician's statement, and additional information as required by the company. All EOI will be provided at no cost to you. If your EOI is not satisfactory:

  1. Your monthly benefit will be set at the amount you were initially eligible for without providing EOI, but only if you enroll within 31 days of becoming eligible.

  2. You will not be covered under the policy if you enroll more than 31 days after your initial eligibility date.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on page 44 rows [2, 1, 2, 3, 1], coverage begins when you become eligible, except for any coverage requiring Evidence of Insurability, which becomes effective either upon your eligibility or upon our approval of the Evidence of Insurability. All effective dates are subject to a Deferred Effective Date provision. In all cases, the specific effective date depends on the requirements for each coverage type.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on page 11 rows [2-14], your insurance coverage or increase in coverage will not become effective immediately if you are absent from work due to accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse, or pregnancy. Instead, the coverage will only begin when you return to active work for a full day. This deferred effective date applies regardless of the intended start date of your insurance or increased coverage.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf pages [11, 12], policyholders may decrease or increase coverage, with higher options subject to application approval and conditions such as a deferred effective date and pre-existing condition limitations. Coverage adjustments occur due to changes in class or rate of pay, effective on the change date if the policyholder is an active employee not absent due to disability. Increases will be deferred if the policyholder was disabled during the change period, becoming effective only after a full day back at work. Increases are subject to the Guaranteed Issue Amount, with subsequent increases exempt from Evidence of Insurability requirements unless the increase is 10% or more in any single occurrence or it has been 3 years since the last approved Evidence of Insurability. Changes in pre-disability earnings take effect upon notice to the insurer. Additionally, any policy changes due to a change in the policy itself become effective on the date of change, subject to deferred effective dates and pre-existing condition limitations.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, if you were previously insured under a Prior Policy and ineligible for benefits on the day before the Participating Employer Effective Date, there will be no Deferred Effective Date provision. The Pre-existing Condition Limitation (PCL) will only apply if you become covered under the new policy on the Participating Employer Effective Date, having been previously covered under the Prior Policy the day before. If your disability coverage was not limited by a pre-existing condition restriction in the Prior Policy, or if it was but would have ceased to apply had the Prior Policy remained in force, the PCL will end on the Participating Employer Effective Date.

The Monthly Benefit for a Pre-existing Condition under the new policy will be the lesser of either the Monthly Benefit provided by the Prior Policy or the Monthy Benefit offered by The Policy. Additionally, the PCL applies to any benefit increase resulting from changing policies, options, class, or The Policy itself.

If you were disabled under the Prior Policy and returned to work as a Full-time Active Employee before the Participating Employer Effective Date, and within 6 months of your return, have a recurrence of the same disability while covered under The Policy with no benefits available for the recurrence under the Prior Policy, the Elimination Period will be waived if the recurrence would have been covered without any further elimination period under the Prior Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, your insurance coverage will terminate on the earliest occasion of:

1. The policy's termination date,
2. the point at which the policy no longer covers your class,
3. if premium payment is overdue,
4. the last day of the premium period,
5. your employer ending your employment,
6. you ceasing to be a full-time active employee in an eligible class for any reason, or
7. your employer's status as a Participating Employer ceases; unless extended through Continuation Provisions.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 12 and 13, coverage can be continued beyond its termination date if the employer provides a plan applicable to all employees equally. Continued coverage is subject to reductions in The Policy, employer premium payments, and terminates when the policy terminates, the employer ceases to be a Participating Employer, or coverage for your class terminates.

Your benefit level will remain as it was before continuation. If your spouse or child serves active military duty outside of specific regions and you meet certain criteria, your coverage may be continued for up to 15 days. For Family Medical Leave or sabbatical, coverage can be continued for up to 8 weeks or 26 weeks if you also qualify for Military Leave, extending longer as per applicable law. If the leave ends prematurely, continuation ceases immediately. Sabbatical coverage continuation requires pre-approval if the leave exceeds 30 days.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (page 13, rows 2-6), if you become disabled and cease being an active employee, your insurance coverage continues: first, during the Elimination Period as long as you remain disabled by the same disability; second, beyond the Elimination Period, for as long as you are entitled to benefits under the policy. The Elimination Period is not specified within these rows but is subject to the provisions of the policy.
<EOS>
According to the Waiver of Premium section in Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 13 (rows 2-6), no premium will be required after the Elimination Period and for as long as benefits are payable. This means that, following the Elimination Period, you won't have to make payments while receiving benefits under this policy. The Elimination Period is not specified in these details.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, if you are entitled to benefits due to total disability and your participating employer's coverage terminates, your benefits will continue as long as your disability persists by the same condition. However, these benefits will not extend beyond the date when we would have stopped paying benefits had the insurance remained active. The termination of your participating employer's coverage for any reason will not affect our liability under this provision. In essence, your benefits will be contingent upon you remaining disabled and would cease at the same point as if the insurance had continued.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, if your insurance ends due to non-retirement employment termination or ineligibility for an eligible class, and you've been insured continuously for at least 12 months, are not disabled, the policy is active, and have no similar coverage under another group policy, you're eligible for a group long term disability conversion policy. To enroll, submit a written request within 31 days of your insurance termination along with the required premium and enrollment fee. Eligible applicants will receive a certificate of insurance effective from the day after their previous policy terminates. The coverage may differ from the original policy, with terms determined based on available conversion policy options at the time of enrollment request.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, disability benefits are payable under the policy if you become disabled while insured and meet specific requirements: a) you must be disabled throughout the Elimination Period, b) remain disabled beyond this period, c) submit Proof of Loss to the company, and d) ensure that payments do not exceed the Maximum Duration of Benefits. Benefits commence on the first day following the Elimination Period and are paid monthly thereafter.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, specific limitations apply to benefits for disabilities caused by mental illness, substance abuse, or their related conditions. Disabilities stemming from mental illness, its consequences, alcoholism under treatment, or non-medical use of certain substances may result in a capped duration of benefits. Benefits will be paid for either the duration of confinement in a medical facility or up to 24 months if not confined, with a total of 24 months for all such disabilities throughout one's lifetime.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, during the elimination period, days spent recovering but returning to work less than half the duration of the elimination period won't extend the period. If you become disabled again within 180 days due to the same or a related cause while the policy remains active, the initial and recurrent disabilities will be considered as one period. Conversely, if you remain non-disabled for 180 days or more, any subsequent disability is treated as new, subject to a fresh elimination period and maximum duration of benefits, and all current policy terms and conditions.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, Page 15 Row 1, the Period of Disability refers to a continuous stretch during which you are considered disabled under the policy. This duration is significant as it determines your eligibility for benefits under the insurance policy. To qualify, the disability must be sustained continuously without interruption until the end of the specified period or until you meet the policy's definition of recovery. The length and conditions of this period may vary depending on the specific terms and conditions of the policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, page 15, row 2, "Recover" or "Recovery" denotes a state where the insured is no longer disabled and has resumed working with the original employer. This return triggers the cessation of premium payments for the insured. The document does not specify further details regarding the duration or conditions under which premiums may resume after recovery.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, if your disability continues beyond the Elimination Period and you earn 20% or less of your indexed pre-disability earnings, your monthly disability benefit will be calculated as follows: First, multiply your pre-disability earnings by the Benefit Percentage. Second, compare this product with the Maximum Benefit. Lastly, from the lesser amount, deduct any Other Income Benefits to arrive at your Monthly Benefit.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf document on page 15 (rows 2-12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), the calculation of disability benefits is detailed when you're earning more than 20% of your indexed pre-disability earnings after the elimination period. During a 12-month period, the monthly benefit is calculated by multiplying your pre-disability earnings by the benefit percentage, comparing the result with the maximum benefit, and deducting other income benefits. If this sum exceeds 100% of your pre-disability earnings, your monthly benefit will be reduced. The 12-month period begins either on the day you start earning more than 20% or at the end of the elimination period. If you aren't receiving Return to Work Incentive benefits and still earn more than 20%, your monthly benefit will be calculated as the greater of two formulas: the Proportionate Loss Formula or the 50% Offset Formula.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (page 15, row 5), the policy outlines an Indexed Pre-disability Earnings provision. If you become disabled and your earnings are less than 20% of your pre-disability income, you will receive a monthly benefit based on this indexed amount, which adjusts for inflation annually. The index used is the Consumer Price Index (CPI) with a maximum increase of 6%. The indexing begins after the first 24 consecutive months of disability. This provision applies only to your base policy and not any riders or additional coverages you may have.
<EOS>
In the policy outlined in Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, excess income may reduce the Monthly Benefit received. If the sum of your Monthly Benefit, Current Monthly Earnings, and Other Income Benefits surpasses 100% of your Pre-disability Earnings, a reduction in your Monthly Benefit will occur, proportional to the excess. This reduction will not bring the Monthly Benefit below the Minimum Monthly Benefit. Overpayment may also trigger overpayment recovery in accordance with policy provisions. It is crucial to note that if your Monthly Benefit becomes less than the Minimum Monthly Benefit due to income reductions, we will not reduce it further.
<EOS>
As per the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, page 15, row 2, your monthly benefit under this policy will not fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit specified in the Schedule of Insurance. This guarantee ensures a certain level of financial aid to you throughout the term of the insurance. The minimum amount is outlined clearly within the schedule itself and forms an essential part of the coverage you've chosen.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 15 and 16, if the Monthly Benefit is payable for a period less than a month, the benefit will be calculated as one-thirtieth of the Monthly Benefit for each day of disability. This means that for every day you are disabled, you will receive 1/30 of your monthly benefit.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, your benefit payments may cease on any of the following conditions: if you are no longer disabled, fail to provide Proof of Loss, stop receiving regular medical care, refuse a requested examination, pass away, reach the maximum duration of benefits as specified in the table, or have current monthly earnings exceeding 80% of your indexed pre-disability earnings (if disabled from occupation). Additionally, benefit payments may terminate if no further benefits are payable under any provision with duration limits in the policy.
<EOS>
In Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, Family Care Credit Benefit details allow deductions for care expenses when in a Rehabilitation program. These expenses are for the supervision of children under age 13 or a mentally/physically handicapped dependent at home. The maximum monthly deduction for each qualifying child or family member is $350 during the first 12 months, then $175 thereafter, not exceeding earnings. Family Care Credits can't surpass $2,500 yearly and are reduced proportionally for periods under a month. Receipts from caregivers are required, and credits cease after 24 months or when no longer in the Rehabilitation program. No family-related care is eligible as a deduction. The remaining earnings after Family Care Credit deduction determine the monthly benefit, with eligibility ceasing if current monthly earnings exceed 80% of pre-disability earnings.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (page 16, rows [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 1]), if you are receiving Monthly Disability Benefits and die, your survivors will receive a Survivor Income Benefit. This benefit is payable upon providing satisfactory proof of death and the claimant's entitlement within one year of your death.

The Survivor Income Benefit is three times your Maximum Monthly Benefit. It is paid to your surviving spouse if any, or equally to your children if no spouse survives. If there are no surviving spouse or children, the benefit goes to your estate. Any overpayment on your claim will be deducted first before payment of the Survivor Income Benefit. The proof of entitlement and death must be provided within a year after your demise for the benefit to be paid out.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, a Surviving Spouse is defined as the legally married partner at the time of death, excluding those who were divorced or separated. To consider your domestic partner or civil union partner, you must either: execute a domestic partner affidavit confirming your partnership for The Policy, or register as such with a government agency where registration is available and provide proof (unless law prohibits this). Continued recognition as domestic partners depends on meeting the criteria set in the affidavit or by applicable law.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, Surviving Children are defined as unmarried offspring, stepchildren, or legally adopted children who rely on the policyholder for support and maintenance. They must either be under age 21 or between ages 21-25 and enrolled full-time in an educational institution. This term also includes any blood-related or related through marriage or domestic partnership children living with the policyholder in a regular parent-child relationship, who were eligible to be claimed as dependents on the policyholder's federal income tax return for the preceding year. Minor children may receive benefit payments via a caregiver until a legal guardian is appointed. If a minor child is entitled to benefits, payment can be made to the caregiver at the insurer's discretion.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, this policy includes a Workplace Modification Benefit. If your disability is covered and your employer agrees to make reasonable modifications for your return to work, the insurer will reimburse these costs, up to the amount of the Maximum Monthly Benefit. To qualify, proposed modifications must be approved in writing. The insurer may evaluate appropriateness through examinations or evaluations by chosen physicians, vocational experts, or rehabilitation specialists. Reimbursement occurs after the modifications are completed, proof of expenses is provided, and you return as an Active Employee.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 17, rows 2 and 3, Workplace Modification refers to alterations in your work environment or job methods to accommodate you while disabled. This modification allows you to perform the essential duties of your job. Payment of this benefit will not affect any benefits you're eligible for under The Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (pages 17, rows 2-3), if you are diagnosed with a Progressive Illness after being covered for this benefit under the policy and provide satisfactory proof from your Physician, you will become eligible for the Progressive Illness Benefit. The details of this benefit aren't explicitly stated in these sections, but it seems that it is contingent upon meeting the conditions mentioned above.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf policy detail (rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2] on pages [17, 18]) discusses Progressive Illness disability benefits. If you become disabled due to a noninfectious, indefinite disease, your pre-disability earnings will be the greater of the amount at the time of physician-verified proof or at the time of disability. Benefits are calculated using this determined earnings and adhering to policy terms effective on the disability date. Until disabled, premiums are based on the greater of pre-disability earnings under this benefit or under the policy. Your premium will not drop below the amount paid at proof submission, except with Waiver of Premium qualification.
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, during your coverage period, if you suffer an accidental bodily injury leading to dismemberment or loss of sight within 365 days after the accident, a monthly benefit will be paid, starting from the Elimination Period. The duration and corresponding benefits are as follows:

- Loss of sight in one eye: 40% of the monthly benefit for life
- Loss of sight in both eyes: 100% of the monthly benefit for life
- Loss of a hand or foot at or above the wrist/ankle joint: 60% of the monthly benefit for life
- Loss of two hands, feet, or eyes: 150% of the monthly benefit for life
- Loss of one hand and one foot or any combination of limbs and sight totaling to two losses mentioned above: 200% of the monthly benefit for life
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on page 18, row numbers [2-12], this policy outlines various scenarios for vision loss compensation. It includes total and partial loss of both eyes (payable up to $100,000 each), as well as the partial loss of one hand and one eye, or one foot and one eye (both payable up to $75,000 each). Furthermore, the policy also covers the loss of one hand or one foot (each payable up to $60,000), with the exception that if both are lost within 90 days, the benefit amount is increased to $100,000. Additionally, the policy provides a lesser payment for temporary total vision loss (up to 26 weeks) or partial permanent vision loss (up to 5% of the total amount, up to a maximum of $4,687.50).
<EOS>
In accordance with the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on page 18, the policy outlines the monthly benefit for the loss of the thumb and index finger of either hand. The benefit is computed as the lesser of two figures: (i) the Maximum Monthly Benefit specified in the Schedule of Insurance or (ii) the insured's Pre-disability Earnings multiplied by the Benefit Percentage. To be eligible for this coverage, the loss must result from an accident occurring during the term of the policy. The Benefit Percentage is 60% for the thumb and 40% for the index finger. These percentages may vary based on the specific terms of the policy.
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 50 rows [2-9], a loss is defined in terms of specific bodily injuries: 1) complete and irreversible paralysis or actual severance above the wrist or ankle joints for hands, feet; 2) entire and irrecoverable loss of sight, speech, or hearing; 3) actual severance above the metacarpophalangeal joints for thumb and index finger. These incidents must result in a complete incapacity to engage in any occupation for which you are suited by education, training, or experience.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, benefits will not be paid for the following disabilities: (1) those not under regular medical care; (2) caused or worsened by war or act of war, (3) resulting from attempted or committed felonies, (4) associated with illegal occupations, or (5) self-inflicted injuries. If you previously received disability benefits from an employer-sponsored plan that terminated prior to this policy's effective date, no additional benefits will be payable for the same disability under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, page 18, rows 2-3, benefits for disabilities caused or worsened by pre-existing conditions may not be paid unless the disability arises after you have been insured for a period of at least 90 days without a break and during which you have complied with all required examinations, reports, or questions about your health. Pre-existing conditions are defined as any medical condition for which you received treatment, consultation, care, or took prescribed drugs within the 12 months prior to your effective date of coverage. Any preexisting conditions that meet these criteria will be subject to a six-month waiting period during which we do not pay benefits related to that condition. After this waiting period, we may only pay benefits for a portion of the costs associated with a preexisting condition up to a maximum of 50% of the total benefits paid for all disabilities.
<EOS>
According to the terms of The Policy outlined in Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 19, row numbers [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], there are two key conditions for eligibility:

1. If you have not received any medical care related to the covered condition for a continuous period of three months while being insured under The Policy.
2. Alternatively, if you have been continuously insured under The Policy for a consecutive twelve-month duration.

These conditions are crucial in determining your status and benefits under this policy.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (page 19, rows 2-11), a pre-existing condition is defined as any accidental bodily injury, sickness (including mental illness), pregnancy, or episode of substance abuse for which medical care was received during the 3 months prior to either your effective date of coverage or the effective date of a change in coverage. Any manifestations, symptoms, findings, or aggravations related to these conditions are also considered pre-existing. This means that these conditions will not be covered by the policy if they occurred before the specified dates.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, Medical Care is covered under the following conditions: a healthcare provider must either consult or offer advice, or recommend, prescribe, or provide treatment. This care can be in-person or virtual, and it includes diagnostic tests, surgical procedures, hospital stays, and prescription drugs. The policy also covers follow-up care for an existing condition and outpatient care. Importantly, the insurance will pay up to 80% of the reasonable and customary costs, with the insured responsible for the remaining 20%.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, treatment under this policy encompasses medical examinations, tests, attendance, or observation as well as the utilization of drugs, medicines, medical services, supplies, and equipment. This includes but is not limited to necessary procedures, consultations with healthcare professionals, prescriptions, hospital stays, surgical interventions, diagnostic imaging, lab work, durable medical equipment, and home health care services. These treatments may be subject to approval and coordination of benefits if other insurance coverage is available.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, you or the benefits recipient must provide written notice of a claim within 30 days after either the date of death or the loss occurrence. If timely notice cannot be given, it should be submitted as soon as possible thereafter. The notice should include the claimant's name, address, and the Participating Employer Account Number. Failure to do so may affect your coverage.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, pages 52 rows 2-4, if a claim is made, we will provide the claimant with Proof of Loss forms within 15 days. Should we fail to do so within this timeframe, the claimant may submit any other written evidence fully describing their claim's nature and extent. This document specifies that the required notice period for form submission is 15 days.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 19 [2-36], proof of disability claim may include the date and cause of disability, prognosis, pre-disability earnings, tax returns, medical information, consulted physicians/facilities, prescribing pharmacies within three years, authorization for releasing medical, employment, and financial data, identification of other income benefits, proof thereof, and evidence of applying for other available income benefits. The submitted proof must be satisfactory to the insurance company, and claimants are not required to claim retirement benefits on a reduced basis.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 20, the policy holder is obligated to submit to interviews and examinations by representatives or professionals of The Company's choice for determining disability status or fulfilling other policy terms. These assessments are at the company's expense and as reasonably required. Refusal without a valid reason may result in denial, suspension, or termination of benefits. The policy holder's additional proof of loss must be deemed satisfactory by the Company.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, written Proof of Loss must be submitted within 90 days following the commencement of the liability period for payment. Failure to provide proof within the stipulated time does not necessarily invalidate a claim if it was impracticable to comply or if proof is given as soon as possible but no later than one year afterward, unless you are legally incompetent. The insurance company may request Proof of Loss throughout your Disability; in such cases, the proof must be provided within 30 days following the request.

According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, benefit payments are issued when the policyholder is deemed disabled (row 2) and eligible for benefits (row 3). Payments are made at the end of each month the policyholder remains disabled (row 4), with optional advance payment based on estimated disability duration (row 6). Any due payments following claim termination will be issued upon receiving satisfactory Proof of Loss (row 9).
<EOS>
According to the Claims to be Paid section on Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf pages 20 (rows 2-11), all payments under this policy are made directly to you. In the event of your death, any unpaid benefits will be distributed to your estate. However, if a payment is owed to your estate, a minor, or an individual who is not legally competent, The Hartford may pay up to $1,000 to a relative who is entitled to it at their discretion. Any such payment fulfills the obligation for the amount paid.
<EOS>
As per Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, if a claim for benefits is either wholly or partially denied, the policyholder will receive written notification detailing the specific reasons behind the denial, referencing the relevant Policy provisions that support the decision. This notification also includes a description of any additional information required to perfect a claim and an explanation as to why it's necessary. Furthermore, the review procedure is explained in this notice.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, within the specified timeframes - 180 days for disability-related claims and 60 days for non-disability claims following a denied claim - you or your representative may request a review of any claim denial by submitting a written application.

This information from Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (pages 20-21, rows 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2) outlines your recourse in case of a dispute regarding disability benefits. If you disagree with the company's decision following their final review of your claim, you have the right to refer the matter to an arbitrator. To initiate arbitration, contact the main office of the American Arbitration Association in Washington, D.C. Proceedings will adhere to the procedures established for Employee Benefit Plan Claims by the American Arbitration Association. One neutral arbitrator from their approved panel will conduct the arbitration, with costs split equally between you and the company unless otherwise ordered by the arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision is final and binding, and it may be turned into a court judgment in any applicable jurisdiction.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, you should apply for Social Security disability benefits when your disability exceeds the minimum required duration. You must submit your application within 45 days from our request for such. If the Social Security Administration denies your eligibility for benefits, you are mandated to follow their reconsideration process and, if denied again, request a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Hearing and Appeals.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, the insurance company may reduce your disability benefits based on an estimate of Social Security disability benefits you or your family might receive. This reduction occurs when it is determined that you, your spouse, or children may be eligible for such benefits. The reduction can be avoided if you apply and pursue appeals as required under the Social Security provision, authorize the Social Security Administration to release information about awards, sign and return a reimbursement agreement, and provide proof of final denial from the Office of Hearing and Appeals when your application is denied.

If a later awarded Social Security disability benefit is lower than the estimate, a refund will be issued in a lump sum. Conversely, if the benefits are higher and overpayments occur on your monthly benefit, you must return a lump sum equal to all overpayments as per the Overpayment Recovery provision. Proof of awards or denials is essential for adjusting your monthly benefit.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on page [21], an overpayment occurs when the total benefits paid exceed the rightful amount under The Policy (rows 2-11), or when payments were made under another group policy instead (rows 6, 7). This can result from retroactive awards from specified sources, late reporting or failure to report Other Income Benefits or earned income, misstatements, fraud, errors, or any other inaccuracies (rows 2-5, 8-10). The policy defines Other Income Benefits and holds the recipient responsible for their accurate reporting.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, the insurer has the right to recover any overpayments made within 30 days from you or your estate, other organizations, insurance companies, or anyone to whom payment was made. Failure to reimburse in a timely manner allows the insurer to reduce or offset future benefits, refer unpaid balances to collection agencies, and pursue legal action in court. Additionally, overpayment recovery terms may be specified in the benefits eligibility reimbursement agreement you'll sign.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 22, rows 2-10, if you experience a disability due to a Third Party's act or omission and receive benefits under the policy for lost wages, failure to initiate legal action against the Third Party within a reasonable timeframe grants us subrogation rights. We have the option to pursue legal action on your behalf to recover any payments made in relation to the disability, should we choose to do so. This applies only when you are entitled to and paid benefits for lost wages due to a Third Party's actions.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, under the Reimbursement section (pages 22, rows 2-12), the policyholder grants the company the right to seek reimbursement for any disability benefits paid or due, in cases where a third party provides payment. This recovery can be achieved through legal judgments, arbitration awards, settlements, or other means. The policyholder is required to repay the company the lesser of: 1) the amount paid or owed by the company; or 2) the recovered amount from the third party, minus any reasonable legal fees incurred during recovery. This repayment must occur if the total received from the third party exceeds the benefits initially paid or due under the policy.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, section on page 22 row 2, "Third Party" refers to any individual or legal entity whose action or inaction contributes fully or partially to the policyholder suffering a Disability, for whom benefits are paid or payable under The Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, legal action against us can only be initiated within specific timeframes. The first limitation is that no legal action may commence sooner than sixty days following the submission of the Proof of Loss. Conversely, any claim must be filed no more than three years after the date the Proof of Loss was required according to the terms of the policy. These time constraints are essential for understanding your rights and responsibilities as outlined in our insurance agreement.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, sections [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] on page 22, Insurance Fraud is considered an act of submitting false or incomplete information with intent to deceive, injure, or defraud the company. Committing such fraud is illegal, and the company reserves the right to detect, investigate, deter, and prosecute perpetrators using all available means. If a policyholder or employer commits Insurance Fraud, legal remedies will be pursued.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (pages 22 and 23, rows 2-6, 1, 1, 2, 3), misstatements about the insured may lead to adjustments in premiums and reassessment of coverage duration. Material facts misrepresented will be employed to decide if, and for how long, insurance should have been provided, post-three years from policy issuance throughout the insured's lifetime. Only written, signed statements can be used after this three-year period, with fraudulent misstatements being an exception.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 23 (rows 2-6, 1, 2), for an individual to be considered "Actively at Work," they must perform their regular occupational duties in the usual manner for their typical number of hours on a scheduled workday. If a day is not a scheduled workday, then the individual was Actively at Work only if they were already doing so on the preceding scheduled workday. This definition applies to the policyholder's wage or profit-earning activities.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, page 54, row 2, an 'Active Employee' is one who consistently works for the employer in the regular business, meeting at least the hours shown on the Insurance Schedule. This means that any employee who meets these criteria is eligible for coverage under the policy. The number of hours required may vary based on the details provided in the schedule.
<EOS>
According to the Bonuses section in Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 23, rows 2-8, your monetary bonuses for this policy are calculated as the monthly average of rewards received from your employer during the 12 months preceding your disability if you were actively employed, or over the entire period you worked for that employer if it's shorter than 12 months. In case neither of these applies, the calculation includes any employer-given bonuses during your disability period or rewards gained from any work performed during this time.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, the commissions referred to are the average monthly monetary commissions earned from an employer during the 12 months preceding your disability onset if you were actively employed at that time, or throughout your entire employment period with that employer if it's shorter than 12 months. Alternatively, commissions could originate from any employer or work performed during your disability period.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, current monthly earnings refer to income you receive from employment, other work for pay or profit, and any additional sources while disabled. These earnings comprise bonuses and commissions and are pro-rated as necessary. The calculation includes earnings from all these sources combined.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 23 and the subsequent rows, Disability is defined as being unable to perform one or more essential duties of your occupation during or post the Elimination Period. If your current monthly earnings are less than 80% of your pre-disability earnings at the end of this period, you will be considered disabled. However, if your earnings are 80% or more, an extension of the Elimibility Period for another 12 months may apply. This Disability can result from accidental injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse, or pregnancy. Loss of a professional or occupational license does not automatically mean you're disabled under this policy. The Disability must affect your ability to perform the duties of your occupation, and a suspended, revoked, restricted, or surrendered license alone does not qualify as Disability.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, on page 24 row 1, the term 'Employer' is defined as equivalent to the Policyholder. This means that the entity responsible for the policy is the same as the one employing individuals or entities under this insurance agreement.
<EOS>

This definition applies specifically to the number of hours worked in your regularly scheduled work week, which is recognized as an Essential Duty.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (page 24, rows 2-4), Indexed Pre-disability Earnings are subject to an annual 5% adjustment. This adjustment takes effect one month after 12 months of benefits have been received. After the initial increase, your earnings will undergo another 5% increase each year on the anniversary of the first adjustment's effective date, with compounding occurring on the following month's first day.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf document on page 24 (rows 2-14) defines Mental Illness as a mental disorder listed in the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association.

This text describes the concept of "Other Income Benefits" in an insurance policy. These benefits encompass a variety of income sources that might overlap with the primary insurance coverage. Here are some key points:

1. Other Income Benefits can include:
   - Portion of a settlement or judgment for lost earnings
   - Retirement benefits from various plans (e.g., Social Security, Railroad Retirement)
   - Portions of income that represent compensation for lost earnings, such as from a lawsuit

2. Other Income Benefits do not include:
   - Early retirement benefits under the United States Social Security Act not received
   - General increases in benefits required by law and applying to all entitled persons (after the date benefits become payable under the policy)
   - Group credit or mortgage disability insurance benefits
   - Various types of personal investment income, military retirement benefits, defined contribution plans, etc.

3. If Other Income Benefits are received in a lump sum or settlement, proof of the amount attributed to loss of income and the period covered by the lump sum or settlement must be provided.

4. If the policyholder cannot or does not provide this information, the entire sum will be assumed as for loss of income, and the time period will be 60 months.

5. A retroactive allocation of any retroactive Other Income Benefit may result in an overpayment of the claim.

6. Any increase in Other Income Benefits that takes effect after the date benefits become payable under the policy will not be included as Other Income Benefits.

Commissions effective on the last day before disability and other fringe benefits or extra compensation are included. Overtime, on-call hours (unless regularly scheduled) are not considered. For hourly employees, it's the average number of hours worked monthly over the preceding 12 months prior to the last active work day before disability, multiplied by their hourly wage on that date. This figure includes contributions made through a salary reduction agreement for IRC Sections 401(k), 403(b) or 457 deferred compensation arrangements, executive non-qualified deferred compensation arrangements, or an IRC Section 125 plan for the same period.
<EOS>

According to the specified section in Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (pages 26, rows 2-12), 'Regular Care of a Physician' necessitates treatment by a physician whose training and experience are appropriate for your disabling condition. This care must align with established medical, research, and rehabilitative organization guidelines, be administered frequently enough to maximize medical improvement, and should correspond directly to the diagnosis of your disabling condition.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, rehabilitation involves the insurance provider collaborating with you to develop a plan for returning to work. This may encompass various services deemed appropriate, such as vocational testing, training, alternative treatments like support groups, physical therapy, occupational therapy, or speech therapy. Additionally, workplace modifications when not already provided, job placement, transitional work, and similar services could be part of the rehabilitation program.

Conditions not included are elective cesareans, false labor, morning sickness, or hyperemesis gravidarum.

For Delaware residents, the definition of Spouse has been expanded to include civil union partners who fulfill policy requirements, either by legal documentation or where such proof is not prohibited by law. The Surviving Spouse definition in the Survivor Income Benefit has been amended to reflect this change as well.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, pages [34, 35], "Spouse" includes your domestic partner under two conditions: either you've executed a satisfactory domestic partner affidavit for the policy or registered as domestic partners with a government agency where applicable, providing proof of registration unless it is prohibited by law. Continuation as domestic partners necessitates ongoing adherence to these requirements. The definition of "Spouse" has been amended to include your domestic partner under similar conditions. For Wisconsin residents, the claim appeal time periods have been removed. In all other respects, the policy and certificates remain unchanged for all parties.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, a Change in Family Status encompasses several events: marriage or civil union, divorce or termination of a civil union, birth or adoption of a child, death of a spouse or partner, emancipation or death of a child, change in employment status of a spouse affecting group insurance, and alterations from full-time to part-time or vice versa.

However, it will remain subject to all policy terms and provisions. For Maine residents, an additional provision applies.
<EOS>
In accordance with the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, coverage may be reinstated after its termination for non-payment of premiums within 90 days if the policyholder or authorized representatives experienced cognitive impairment or functional incapacity at that time.

Claim appeal time periods are changed to 180 days if less than 180 days, and the Arbitration provision has been removed. For New Jersey residents, the Change in Family Status provision has been replaced with new terms.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, a Change in Family Status includes getting married or forming a domestic partnership (including executing an affidavit), divorcing or terminating a domestic partnership, having a child (by birth, adoption, or legal guardianship), the death of a spouse, child emancipation or death, loss of group insurance due to a spouse's unemployment, and changes in employment status from part-time to full-time or vice versa.

<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5419875 policy modification details key aspects:

1) The end of the Pre-existing Conditions Limitation either on the Policy Effective Date if coverage was not limited previously, or else on the date it would have ceased under the Prior Policy had it remained in force.

As per Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, Vermont law mandates that health insurers provide coverage to parties in a civil union equivalent to what's offered to married individuals. This requirement is outlined on page 34, row 2 of the document. The law enforces this equivalence to promote fairness and inclusivity in health insurance coverage.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5419875 document amends the policy's definitions regarding marital relationships and family connections to include those established through civil unions according to Vermont law. Terms such as "spouse," "dependent," "children," "family," etc., now encompass those in civil unions. A dependent is defined as a spouse, civil union partner, or child (natural, stepchild, legally adopted, or minor/disabled dependents) born or brought into a marriage or civil union. This extends to the covered child definition which includes children born or brought into the same circumstances.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, Vermont law grants civil union parties the same benefits, protections, and responsibilities as married couples under state law, but federal laws may affect health insurance benefits. ERISA, a federal law governing employer/employee relationships, doesn't require private employers to enroll civil union partners in health benefit plans. Governmental employers (not federal) must provide health benefits to the dependents of civil union parties if they offer them to spouses. Federal laws also control COBRA continuation rights and Internal Revenue Code treatment of premiums. As a result, access to certain benefits under this policy may be limited for civil union partners and their families due to federal law. Washington residents should note that the Surviving Spouse definition in the Survivor Income Benefit has been amended. Expert advice is recommended to determine rights under this contract.

To enroll, evidence of insurability is required, demonstrating an acceptable health status. Enrollment must be completed within 31 days from the policy's issue date [41, 9]. The policy may be cancelled if premiums are not paid promptly, or if misrepresentations regarding eligibility were made during enrollment [41, 8].
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, the coverage period commences following a deferred effective date, and continuous coverage can be ensured from a prior policy. The policy may terminate as stated, but continuation provisions apply post-termination. Premium waiver is possible under specific conditions, all information found on pages 41 rows [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17].
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, on pages 41 rows 19-25, we find details about various insurance benefits. The Life Insurance Benefit offers coverage based on the policy amount, with no additional payments required. An Accelerated Benefit is also included, allowing early access to a portion of the death benefit in case of terminal illness.

A Conversion Right is provided, enabling policyholders to convert their term life insurance into permanent insurance without evidence of insurability under specific conditions. The Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefits provide extra coverage upon accidental death or dismemberment.

Definitions for key terms are provided on page 50, while Benefits and Exclusions are detailed from pages 50-51. Notably, the policy contains exclusions such as suicide within two years of issuance or participation in hazardous activities without prior consent. These details are crucial for understanding your insurance coverage under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, on row 1 of page 42, this section pertains to ERISA provisions. It states that the policy provides coverage for long-term disability benefits, with a maximum monthly benefit amount set at 60% of the pre-disability earnings, not exceeding $15,000 per month. The benefit period is up to age 65 or until the end of the defined period specified in the plan document, whichever comes first. Elimination periods of either 90 or 180 days are available for selection. The policy includes residual and own occupation definitions for disability, with the latter lasting for a 24-month period following the onset date of disability. Furthermore, it is specified that the claimant must be under regular care by a licensed medical professional for coverage to commence.
<EOS>
Under the Basic Life Insurance coverage detailed in Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, a specified Accidental Death and Dismemberment benefit is offered. This benefit applies if the insured's death or dismemberment results from an accident. The payable amount ranges from 2x to 3x the insured's annual base salary (as of the date of the policy), with no maximum limit. The benefit will be paid in addition to any other life insurance benefits and is subject to a 1-year waiting period. If the accident occurs within the first year, partial payments may apply based on the severity of the dismemberment.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, on pages 42, rows 2 and 1, full-time active employees who are physicians and legal residents or citizens of the United States are eligible for coverage. These employees must work at least 35 hours weekly, excluding on-call hours, and this excludes temporary, leased, or seasonal staff.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, eligibility waiting period for coverage varies. If you're already working for the Employer on the Participating Employer Effective Date, there is no waiting period. However, if you start work after the Participating Employer Effective Date, a 90-day waiting period applies. Both scenarios involve continuous time periods.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on page 42, row 1, the policy outlines a Basic Amount of Life Insurance. The policyholder is insured for an amount not specified, with the coverage duration lasting until age 65 or the end of the Level Term Period, whichever comes first. Premiums are payable annually and are guaranteed to remain level throughout the Level Term Period. Furthermore, this Basic Amount can be converted to a permanent life insurance policy without evidence of insurability at the end of the Level Term Period, subject to certain conditions and within the conversion period. The conversion amount is determined based on the greater of the insured's original Basic Amount or the actual level term premium times the number of years the level term premium has been paid.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 42 rows [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 1, 2], your Basic Principal Sum's maximum amount is twice your annual earnings, capped at $200,000, rounded up to the next highest multiple of $1,000 if not already a multiple. Your Basic Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit will never exceed the amount for which premium has been paid. Additionally, the minimum Basic Principal Sum is set at $10,000.
<EOS>
In the Seat Belt and Air Bag Coverage section of Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, it is detailed that the Seat Belt Benefit Amount equals 100% of the Basic AD&D Principal Sum, with a maximum payout of $50,000 and a minimum of $1,000. Meanwhile, the Air Bag Benefit Amount equates to 5% of the same Basic AD&D Principal Sum, capped at $5,000. This coverage is subject to certain conditions and requirements as outlined in this policy document.
<EOS>
According to the Repatriation Benefit outlined in Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (pages 43, rows 1-2), a maximum of 5% of the Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D) Principal Sum is allocated for repatriation expenses, up to $5,000. This benefit applies in the event of death due to an accident covered under this policy, providing funds for transporting the deceased's remains back to their country of origin or permanent residence. The beneficiary is responsible for submitting necessary receipts and documentation as proof of expenses within a specified timeframe, typically 90 days from the date of death.
<EOS>
In the specified sections of Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (pages 43, rows 2-6), it is outlined that the policy's life insurance amount may be reduced based on two circumstances:

1) Conversion Right: Any life insurance coverage acquired as a result of this right will be subtracted from the total life insurance amount.

2) Prior Policy: If there exists any life insurance covered under the prior policy, it too shall be deducted from the current total life insurance amount.

This reduction applies to both paid and payable policies.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 43 rows [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], your life insurance and principal sum will experience reductions as you age. Specifically, a 65% reduction applies on the policy anniversary following age 65, and another 50% reduction at age 70. These reductions are based on the amount in force immediately prior to these respective anniversary dates. The reductions apply not only to your current coverage but also if you become covered under the policy or experience an increase in coverage after reaching age 65.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, eligibility for coverage occurs on the soonest date out of three possibilities: the Participating Employer's effective date, the day you join an Eligible Class, or completion of the Eligibility Waiting Period for Coverage as shown in the Schedule of Insurance (if applicable). In other words, your eligibility starts either with the commencement of your employment, joining the specified employee group, or after meeting the waiting period stipulated in the insurance schedule.
<EOS>
As per the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf enrollment section (page 43, rows 2-3), if you have Non-Contributory Coverage, your employer will automatically enroll you. Nevertheless, you are obligated to complete a beneficiary designation form to specify the recipient(s) of any potential benefits. It's essential to take care of this requirement promptly for seamless coverage.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, you'll need to provide Evidence of Insurability for any coverage exceeding the Basic Guaranteed Issue Amount or if you were eligible for previous coverage but did not enroll and now opt for coverage under the current policy. If your provided evidence is unsatisfactory, your life insurance amount will match the eligible amount without providing evidence, given enrollment within 31 days of eligibility. Any enrollment more than 31 days after eligibility results in no coverage under the policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, Evidence of Insurability is required and can consist of a completed application, medical examination, attending Physician's statement, or any additional information necessary. This evidence will be provided at the company's expense, except in cases of late enrollment. The company will then assess your insurability, informing you in writing of their decision regarding any Evidence of Insurability submission.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (page 44, rows 2-10), if you're set to be covered under the policy, for increased benefits, or a new benefit, and are not Actively at Work due to a physical or mental condition on the coverage start date, your coverage will commence only upon your return to Active Work. This deferred effective date applies when the reason for non-coverage is a health issue.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, the initial coverage under the policy commences and is not deferred if, on the day before the Participating Employer Effective Date, you were insured under a prior policy and actively at work or on an authorized family and medical leave. If this is the case but you are not actively working on the Participating Employer Effective Date and meet The Policy's eligibility requirements, your insurance amount will be the lesser of the life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment principal sum from the prior policy or shown in the Schedule of Insurance. This reduced amount, subject to any reductions in The Policy and without increase, continues for up to 12 months unless terminated early due to reasons outlined under The Termination provision. If coverage ends because you are actively working, you may be covered as an Active Employee under The Policy. Your insurance terminates earlier if the Prior Policy terminates or you cease to meet eligibility requirements under the Prior Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 44 and 45, the effective date for changes in coverage depends on their nature: decreases become effective upon the change itself, while increases take effect on the latest of three scenarios - either the date of change, the date the Deferred Effective Date provision requirements are fulfilled, or when Evidence of Insurability is approved (if necessary).
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on page 45 (rows 2-1,2), if you wish to increase your life insurance coverage, you must provide evidence of insurability regardless of whether you're already enrolled for basic life insurance under the policy or not. If you've already been enrolled, this applies for any additional basic life insurance coverage, including the initial amount. Additionally, if the requested increase surpasses the Guaranteed Issue Amount, evidence is still required. Unsatisfactory evidence will not alter your current life insurance amount.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, it is stated that if your life insurance coverage increases due to an elevated income (based on a multiple of your earnings), you must provide evidence of insurability when your increased earnings result in coverage exceeding the Guaranteed Issue Amount. A rise in premiums will coincide with this enhanced coverage. Once approved, there is no further need for evidence of insurability if your insurance amount increases solely due to income growth. However, failure to provide suitable evidence or if submitted evidence is unsatisfactory may lead to a restricted increase (up to the eligible limit without providing evidence) and prevent any subsequent adjustments until approval is granted.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, your coverage will cease on the earliest of six conditions:

  1) The policy termination date.

  2) The date your employment ends or you no longer belong to a class eligible for insurance.

  3) Non-payment of premium when due.

  4) Your inactivity at work.

  5) Your employer's termination or ceasing to be a Participating Employer.

  6) Unless extended by the Continuation Provisions, any of these events will terminate your coverage.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (pages 45, 46) outlines continuation provisions for insurance coverage. Coverage can be continued beyond its termination date if the employer provides a plan applicable to all employees equally and not under more than one Continuation Provision. The amount of continued coverage will match the level in effect before termination, subject to any reductions in the policy, premium payments, time limits, and termination conditions (e.g., policy termination or employer ceasing to be a participating employer).

Coverage continuation during leaves of absence, military leave of absence, Family Military Leave of Absence, lay-off, status change, disability insurance, sickness or injury, Family Medical Leave, and sabbatical have specific durations and requirements. For instance, coverage may continue for up to 12 months due to sickness or injury or up to 8 weeks during a Family Medical Leave, subject to applicable laws. Sabbatical continuation requires pre-approval if longer than 30 days.

In summary, insurance coverage can be continued under various circumstances, but it is subject to specific terms and conditions outlined in this policy section of the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, pages 46 and 47, the Waiver of Premium provision enables you to maintain your Life Insurance coverage without payment if you become disabled and qualify for this benefit. The continued coverage will be:

1. Equal to the amount in force on the date you cease being an Active Employee.
2. Subject to any reductions as outlined by the policy.
3. Will not increase.
4. The qualification for Waiver of Premium is subject to the conditions set forth in the policy.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on page 47, row 2, this policy only covers Your Basic Life Insurance. No additional or optional coverages are applicable under this provision. The specifics of this coverage may be subject to other terms and conditions within the policy document.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 47, rows 2-10, 'Disabled' refers to a condition where you are unable to perform any work for which you are qualified due to injury or sickness, considering your education, training, or experience. Alternatively, being diagnosed with a life expectancy of 12 months or less qualifies as Disabled.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, page 47, rows 2-9, to qualify for the Waiver of Premium provision, you must: be under age 60 and covered under the policy when disabled; provide proof of being disabled for six consecutive months starting on the date you last actively worked; and submit this proof within one year of your last day as an active employee. To be eligible, you must have been actively working under the policy before applying for the waiver.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf outlines the conditions for waiver of premiums. Premium waiver begins after notification, but not before the first 6 months of disability. Proof of continued disability and occasional examinations are required within the initial 2 years, followed by an annual examination thereafter. Failure to provide proof or refuse examination may result in termination of premium waiver. However, returning to work for less than 5 days during the first 6 months doesn't interrupt the waiting period, provided the disability continues throughout the period. Returning to work for more than 5 days requires a new waiting period. Additionally, if your application for premium waiver is denied, you may be eligible for conversion of coverage under the Conversion Right.
<EOS>
In the event of death within a year after leaving active employment with Hartford Cert 5419875, and before qualifying for Waiver of Premium, the policy will pay out the existing life insurance amount, provided the deceased was continuously disabled for at least six months prior to death, and premiums had been consistently paid for coverage during this period.
<EOS>
According to the policy section in Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (pages 47, rows 2-9), the Waiver of Premium will continue as long as you remain disabled before attaining Normal Retirement Age if you are disabled prior to age 60. Once this waiver ends, there are two possible scenarios:

1) If you return to work in an Eligible Class as an Active Employee, you may again become eligible for coverage provided premiums are paid on time.

2) If you do not return to work in an Eligible Class, the coverage will terminate. Under these circumstances, you may exercise the Conversion Right if done within the specified time limits; however, the Amount of Life Insurance subject to conversion will be based on the terms and conditions of the Conversion Right.
<EOS>
In case of insurance policy termination or cessation of your employer as a Participating Employer in Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, you may have the option to convert the policy within the specified time limits (if not yet qualified for Waiver of Premium). If eligible and qualified, continued Waiver of Premium can be approved post-termination. However, once qualified, termination or cessation won't affect your coverage under this provision.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, upon your death during policy coverage, a Life Insurance Benefit will be paid following the submission of Proof of Loss, in adherence with the Proof of Loss provision. The benefit will be distributed in accordance with the general provisions of the policy. This payout is subject to the terms and conditions outlined within the policy document.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, under the Accelerated Benefit provision (rows 2-7 on page 48), if you're terminally ill, aged under 60, and have a policy with a minimum of $10,000 life insurance coverage, you can request an advance payment, ranging from a minimum of $3,000 to a maximum of 80% of your coverage (up to $500,000). However, the total advance payment cannot exceed 80% of your policy amount. This option is exercisable only once. For instance, if you have a policy worth $20,000, you can request any amount between $3,000 and $16,000 to be paid early instead of the remaining sum upon death. Upon proof of terminal illness, you'll also qualify as disabled for Waiver of Premium. Certain circumstances, such as legal claims by creditors or government benefit qualifications, may require you to adhere to all terms and conditions to receive an advance payment. If you have assigned your rights and interest regarding your life insurance, the insurer must obtain a release from the assignee before any benefits are payable.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf at pages 48 rows 2, 3, and 1 (and partially at row 2), the policy reserves the right to demand ongoing proof of a terminal illness diagnosis. This evidence must be provided by a physician. If such proof is not submitted or if you refuse a requested examination by a physician, the accelerated benefit will not be paid out.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, if you are no longer terminally ill, your coverage may continue or end based on specific conditions. If you return to an Eligible Class and pay the premium, coverage remains in force. If you do not return to an Eligible Class but remain disabled (subject to Waiver of Premium provision), coverage also continues. However, if neither condition is met, your coverage will terminate, and you may have a chance to exercise the Conversion Right, provided you act within the specified time limits. Notably, any Accelerated Benefit paid reduces the amount of coverage.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (page 49, rows 2-14) details the conversion right when Life Insurance coverage under the policy ends. You may convert terminated coverage to an individual policy without providing Evidence of Insurability, except for Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefits or any ineligible/uncovered amounts. To be eligible for conversion:

1. The policy must have been active for at least 5 years if it ends due to termination, coverage termination for an Eligible Class, or if your employer is no longer a Participating Employer.
2. The amount convertible is limited to $10,000 or the Life Insurance Benefit under the policy minus any group life insurance coverage eligible within 31 days of termination, should the policy end for reasons other than those mentioned above.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 49, rows 2, the term 'Insurer' encompasses us or another insurance company that agrees to issue policies in accordance with this Conversion Right. This provision allows policyholders to convert their current policy into a new one under specific conditions, such as upon the occurrence of certain events like death or maturity, or at specified times stated within the policy terms. The new policy issued by the Insurer will not exceed the original policy's cash value or net premiums paid, whichever is greater. This conversion privilege extends for a set period, usually until the policy's termination date.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, to convert your coverage: complete a Notice of Conversion Right form and have your employer sign it. The Insurer must receive this within 31 days after Life Insurance terminates or 15 days from the date your employer signs, whichever is later; however, requests are not accepted more than 91 days after termination. After verifying eligibility, the Insurer will send a Conversion Policy proposal requiring completion and return within the specified time along with premium payment. The issued policy will be effective from the 32nd day after coverage ends, replacing existing coverage for that amount under the policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 49 and 50, the Conversion Policy issued upon termination of this Life Insurance will be based on available forms at conversion time and premiums will correspond to the Insurer's rates for applicants of your age class. The policy will not include additional benefits or term insurance, nor offer the same coverage terms as the original policy. Conversion is inapplicable to any Amount of Life Insurance being continued under the Waiver of Premium provision or Continuation Provisions until such coverage ends.
<EOS>
In the event of death within 31 days after coverage under this policy terminates (as stated in Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf pages [50] rows [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1, 2]), The Hartford will pay the Amount of Life Insurance you would have been eligible for had conversion been applied, provided that proof of loss is submitted. If a Conversion Policy has already commenced, no life insurance benefit will be paid under this policy for the converted amount.
<EOS>
According to the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit section of Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (pages 50, rows 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2), if you suffer an injury within 365 days of an accident resulting in specific losses, the insurer will pay a portion or entire Principal Sum (as shown in the Schedule of Insurance) upon receiving Proof of Loss. The payment adheres to the General Provisions of the Policy. Only one person will receive a total sum for all losses stemming from the same accident. This Benefit is subject to the Policy's Proof of Loss provision, and no additional payments beyond the Principal Sum will be made for the same incident.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on page 50 rows [1-15], the policy outlines various benefit amounts for specific disabilities. The principal sum is payable in full for total loss of both hands, feet, sight in both eyes, or loss of speech and hearing in both ears. For a partial loss such as one hand and one foot, or sight in one eye, the principal sum is also paid out. Partial losses like movement of either upper or lower limbs (quadriplegia or paraplegia), triplegia, hemiplegia, or uniplegia pay a percentage of the principal sum, specifically 3/4, 1/2, 1/4, and 1/4, respectively. Additionally, specific parts like the thumb and index finger of either hand or a single ear will receive 1/4 of the principal sum.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 50 and 51, a Seat Belt and Air Bag Benefit is payable if an insured sustains an injury resulting in a loss covered under the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit. This benefit applies to the insured as either a passenger wearing a seatbelt or the licensed operator of a properly registered motor vehicle wearing a seatbelt, as verified on a police accident report. The Seat Belt and Air Bag Benefits are each less than the product of the Principal Sum multiplied by their respective percentages (Seat Belt Benefit Percentage or Air Bag Benefit Percentage) but not exceeding the Maximum Amount for this benefit. If seatbelt usage cannot be confirmed at the time of accident, a Minimum Benefit will apply under the Seat Belt Benefit. The benefits are payable after providing Proof of Loss in accordance with the policy's provisions and adhering to the general policies outlined in the contract. Additionally, an Air Bag Benefit is payable if the insured was positioned in a seat equipped with a factory-installed airbag and properly strapped in at the time of airbag inflation.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, an accident is defined for the sole purpose of this benefit as an unintentional collision of a Motor Vehicle, regardless of whether or not the policyholder was wearing a Seat Belt. This definition applies only within the context of the stated benefit, with no specific time restrictions mentioned in this section.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, an Air Bag refers to an inflatable supplemental passive restraint system installed by the Motor Vehicle manufacturer. This system inflates upon collision to protect individuals from injury and death, yet it is not considered a Seat Belt. Proper replacement parts must be installed in accordance with the Motor Vehicle's manufacturer's specifications. It is crucial to note that an Air Bag, as defined here, serves as a distinct safety feature.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, the term 'Seat Belt' refers to an unaltered belt, lap restraint, or lap and shoulder restraint installed by a Motor Vehicle manufacturer. The Seat Belt and Air Bag Benefit is not payable if the policyholder is operating the vehicle at the time of injury while intoxicated or under the influence of drugs such as sedatives, narcotics, barbiturates, amphetamines, or hallucinogens, unless prescribed by or administered by a Physician.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, intoxication is defined as a blood alcohol content level, or the results of other means of testing blood alcohol, that meets or exceeds the legal presumption of intoxication in the state where the accident occurred. Additionally, it includes the results of testing other substances if they also meet this legal threshold.

A maximum of $500 for burial expenses may also be paid to a person equitably entitled, and any payment releases The Hartford from further liability. If a beneficiary is a minor, The Hartford may pay their share until a legal guardian is appointed, providing up to $200 at the policyholder's death and monthly installments of not more than $200. Any payment to any person will release The Hartford from all further liability for the amount paid.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, on pages 53 and the specified row numbers, you can designate or modify your beneficiary by filing a form with your Employer in writing. The forms must be deemed satisfactory by us and should be submitted prior to your death for acceptance. Changes become effective upon signing and dating the form, regardless of any subsequent deaths.

This Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf section on pages [58, 59] outlines the Lay Off coverage.

You must do this within 60 days from either the date your coverage would end or when you receive notice of your right to continue coverage. The premium charged may not exceed 102% of the premium paid for life insurance coverage for an active employee.

The Employer will inform you about your right to continue coverage, the monthly premium amount, and payment details. Upon request, they'll provide a written verification of the cost of coverage. Coverage continues until either you're covered under another group policy or the 18th month following termination or layoff.

If your coverage ends due to the Employer failing to notify you or pay premium after timely receipt, they will be liable for benefit payments as if you were still covered, according to Minnesota law. A laid-off status means a reduction in work hours that makes you ineligible for coverage. Termination excludes discharge for gross misconduct but includes retirement.

Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf outlines claim procedures for non-disability-related claims on pages [68, 69]. Claim decisions are made independently and impartially, without bias towards benefit denials. To file a claim, obtain a form from your employer or administrator, complete sections by you, employer/admin, and attending physician or hospital. Send the completed form to the insurance company's representative for evaluation. A decision will be made within 90 days, extendable to 180 days with written notice. An appeal process exists if a claim is denied; it must be initiated within 60 days of denial, and the insurer has 60-120 days to render a final decision upon extension. All adverse benefit determinations will provide specific reasons, Policy references, and information about necessary materials for claim perfection, as well as appeal procedures, time limits, and your right to bring a civil action under ERISA.

<EOS>
Under Unum's Long Term Disability Plan outlined in policy 4702860, financial protection is offered by paying a percentage of your pre-disability income during disability periods. Eligibility for these payments can extend to cases where you continue working. The payment amount is contingent on your earnings prior to the onset of disability, and specific percentages aren't specified in the provided section. Critical details such as duration, exclusions, or maximum limits may be found elsewhere in the policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, the effective date of this policy is June 1, 2005.

According to Unum Policy 4702860, all active US employees of the employer are eligible for coverage under the specified policy. This encompasses every worker in an active employment status within the United States as the employer. No specific timeframe or percentage was explicitly stated regarding eligibility requirements. However, it's essential to maintain continuous employment with the employer to ensure continued coverage.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860, employees must work a minimum of 30 hours per week to be eligible for insurance coverage. This means that if an employee works fewer than 30 hours weekly, they may not qualify for the benefits offered under this policy.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, the waiting period for disability benefits varies based on the date of employment eligibility. For employees who were part of an eligible group before June 1, 2005, the waiting period is the first month coinciding or immediately following 90 days of continuous active employment. Conversely, employees joining an eligible group after June 1, 2005, must also wait for the first month coinciding or following 90 days of continuous active employment to receive benefits.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, if your employment terminates and you are rehired within a year, the waiting period for benefits is waived based on your previous work while in an eligible group. All other policy provisions apply. This means that if you meet these criteria and return to work within 12 months, you can bypass the waiting period when it comes to reapplying for benefits at a later time.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, your employer bears the cost of coverage. The policy states that your employer is responsible for payment, as specified in the contract between you and your employer. This arrangement remains in effect until any alteration or termination occurs in accordance with the policy's terms. However, it's essential to note that additional details regarding contribution percentages, eligibility requirements, or applicable deductibles may be found within the policy itself.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, the elimination period lasts for 180 days. Benefits will commence once this period is over, starting on the day following its completion. This means that if you are eligible and submit a valid claim during this period, you will receive benefits from the day after the 180-day mark has been reached. This waiting period may seem long, but it helps ensure that benefits are provided only when necessary, as per policy requirements.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, Physicians and Administrative Officers receive 60% of their monthly earnings, capped at $15,000 per month.

<EOS>
This Unum Policy 4702860.pdf specifies the Maximum Period of Payment for a disability benefit.

<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf on page 5, row 53, the policy guarantees Continuity of Coverage. This means that as long as you meet certain conditions and make timely payments, your coverage will continue without interruption, even if you develop a health condition during the initial underwriting period or when reapplying for coverage after an earlier lapse. The policy requires that you maintain continuous coverage, and any break in coverage lasting more than 63 days may result in a new underwriting evaluation at the standard rates applicable to your then-current age. Furthermore, there is no restriction on the number of times you can reapply for coverage following a break in coverage, but each subsequent application will be subject to new underwriting guidelines and may result in higher premiums based on your current health status.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf on page 5, row 57, a pre-existing condition will be considered if it has been symptomatic or treated within the past 12 months (3/12). During the first 12 months of coverage, only 80% of benefits will be payable for such conditions. After the initial year, full benefits will apply, given that the condition remains stable for a consecutive 12-month period without treatment or symptoms.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf on pages 5 and 6, row numbers 63, 64, and 2, the Work Life Assistance Program provides the following key points: This program offers a range of resources designed to support employees facing personal issues that might impact their work performance, such as counseling services, legal consultations, and financial guidance. Eligible employees may access these services free of charge for up to eight sessions per issue, within a 12-month period. It is essential to note that the policy was updated in June 2005 (LTD-CLM-1). However, this information represents only an overview; for a complete understanding of your coverage, refer to the certificate of coverage section.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, it is essential to notify Unum of a disability claim as soon as possible. Written notice should ideally be sent within 30 days following the onset of disability. Proof of the claim must be provided no later than 90 days after your elimination period, or up to one year if unable to provide it earlier. The claim form can be obtained from your employer or requested from Unum. If the form is not received within 15 days of a request, send written proof of the claim without delay. Immediate notification is required upon returning to work in any capacity.
<EOS>
To file a claim under Unum Policy 4702860, both you and your employer are required to fill out the respective sections of the claim form. Once completed, provide the form to your attending physician who should then fill out their section and submit it directly to Unum for processing.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, your disability claim proof must establish regular physician care, monthly earnings, disability onset date, cause, extent (with restrictions and limitations preventing work), hospital or institutional treatment details including physicians, and may require ongoing medical and non-medical information. Proof of continuing disability must be submitted within 45 days if requested, and Unum reserves the right to obtain additional information. Failure to provide essential information may lead to claim denial or discontinued payments.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf (6/1/2005) REV 1, payments under LTD-CLM will be made directly to you. This policy specifies that Unum will make these payments should you become disabled and are unable to work, as per the terms of your contract. The amount of payments is contingent on your monthly earnings before disability, with a maximum of 60% of such earnings being covered by the policy. These payments will continue until you either return to work or reach the policy's maximum benefit period, which extends up to age 65.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, the recipient is obligated to reimburse any overpayments resulting from fraud, errors in claim processing, or receipt of deductible sources of income. Repayment methods will be decided by Unum, and they will not exceed the amount overpaid. It is crucial to note that Unum will not recover more money than the overpaid amount.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf on pages 8, rows 3 and 4, the initial premium for each long-term disability plan is determined by the rates shown in the Rate Information Amendment(s). The premium amount can vary based on factors such as age, gender, occupation, and benefit level chosen. The policy includes a Nonforfeiture Option, which allows for a reduced benefit payment if the policyholder fails to pay the premium. The policy also specifies that the premium remains constant throughout the term of the policy unless there is a rate increase due to plan amendments or changes in state regulations. Additionally, the policy requires evidence of insurability upon application and during the conversion period, ensuring the coverage is appropriate for the policyholder's health status. Furthermore, it's essential to note that the elimination period starts on the date the disability begins and can range from 30 days up to six months.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, premium payments are waived for the policyholder while they receive Long Term Disability benefits. This waiver applies during the period of disability-related payment receipt. The policy does not specify an end date for this waiver, suggesting it may persist as long as the recipient continues to meet eligibility requirements for LTD payments. It's important to note that this policy provision only pertains to premium payments, and any other obligations or conditions stipulated elsewhere in the policy remain applicable.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, on page 8, row 13, premium rates may change based on the Rate Information Amendment(s). The policy guarantees the initial rate for a specific period, typically six or twelve months, and any changes will be communicated in writing with at least 30 days' notice prior to implementation. If there is an increase greater than 10%, the policyholder may terminate their coverage without penalty within 60 days of receiving the rate change notification.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, premium due dates for this policy are determined by the Premium Due Dates outlined in the Rate Information Amendment(s). The Policyholder must ensure that all premium payments reach Unum on or before their designated due date. These payments should be made in United States dollars.
<EOS>
Premium adjustments in Unum Policy 4702860, as detailed on pages [8], take effect from the policy month and are due on the subsequent premium due date. Such changes will not be prorated daily, but monthly if premiums are not paid monthly. In case of fraud, premium adjustments span all policy years. For monthly payments, premium alterations result in a monthly pro-rated adjustment on the following premium due date. Unum only makes premium adjustments for the current and prior policy year; however, should fraud occur, changes will be made across all policy years.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, the policyholder is required to regularly provide information about eligible employees, changes in coverage amounts, and termination of coverage. Additionally, occupational information and any other necessary claim-management data should be submitted. Unum may request additional information deemed reasonable. The policyholder's records related to this policy will be available for review at any convenient time by Unum.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, any clerical error or omission by Unum will not prevent an employee from obtaining coverage, impact the amount of insurance coverage, or cause coverage to start or persist if it would not have been effective otherwise (as detailed on page [9] rows [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]). Essentially, technical mistakes do not affect eligibility, coverage levels, or coverage duration.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, both the insurer (Unum) and the policyholder can cancel or modify this insurance policy or a plan under it. Reasons for cancellation or modification include: inadequate participation among eligible employees, failure to provide required information, non-compliance with obligations, a small number of insured employees, late premium payments, changes in the size, occupation, or age of the eligible group due to corporate transactions, and late payment of premium portions during the 31-day grace period. If cancellation is not due to premium default, a 31-day written notice will be provided. The policyholder may cancel the policy if modifications are unacceptable, but must give at least 31 days' notice. Upon cancellation, coverage ends at midnight on the last day of coverage, and the cancellation does not affect payable claims. Premiums for coverage during the grace period remain the policyholder's responsibility.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, if an employee is on a family and medical leave of absence, coverage will continue based on the policyholder's human resource policies. Premium payments must be made, and the policyholder's approval in writing is required for the leave. Coverage extends until the end of the longer of: 1) the leave period required by the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and any amendments; or 2) the leave period mandated by state law. In instances where the policyholder's policies do not offer continuation during a family and medical leave, coverage will resume upon return to active employment. The company will not apply a new waiting period, pre-existing conditions exclusion, or require evidence of insurability during this time.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliated companies are included within the scope of this policy. Specifically, these entities must comply with all terms and conditions stated herein. They are defined as legal entities with a significant connection, such as common ownership, management control, or operational integration, with Unum Group or its designated affiliates. This connection extends to companies located in various cities and states across the United States. For instance, it includes entities based in Portland, Maine and Chattanooga, Tennessee. The extent of their inclusion is not limited by geography; they can be present in multiple locations. The degree of control or ownership required for a company's classification as an affiliate is not explicitly stated within this section. However, the common thread that binds them all is a close relationship with Unum Group.

According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, section CC.FP-1 (revision 1) on page 11 row 2, the policy outlines that if an employee becomes disabled and is receiving both Short-Term Disability (STD) benefits and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), Unum will reduce the STD payment by up to 50% once SSDI benefits exceed a certain amount. This reduction applies only after the employee has received STD benefits for 24 months. The policy further states that if an employee is also receiving Workers' Compensation, Unum will continue to provide benefits until the earlier of the end of the Workers' Compensation period or the end of the 24-month STD benefit period. This reduction in STD benefits does not apply if the SSDI payment is due solely to a condition unrelated to the disability for which the employee is receiving STD benefits. The policy also mentions that if an employee's SSDI benefits terminate, their STD benefits will resume at the full amount, subject to any applicable deductions and waiting periods.

According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf on pages 12, rows 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6, the certificate of coverage is a document prepared by Unum. It outlines the coverage you may be eligible for, the recipients of payments from Unum, and any limitations, exclusions, and requirements within the plan. Critical aspects to note include specific terms, payment destinations, and restrictions applicable to your policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, eligibility for coverage occurs when you are employed by your group's eligible employer. The effective date of coverage is either the plan's start date or the day following the completion of your waiting period. These terms and conditions can be found on pages 12, rows 1, 2, 4, and 5 of the policy document.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, coverage begins at 12:01 a.m. on the date you are eligible for insurance. If your employer covers the full cost, coverage starts on this date. If the cost is shared or you pay in full, coverage begins either on the date of eligibility if you apply on time, within 31 days after eligibility, or when Unum approves your application (if evidence of insurability is required). This evidence is needed if you're a late applicant or reapplying after voluntarily cancelling coverage. The evidence form can be obtained from your employer. Eligibility dates are crucial; failure to apply within 31 days may require evidence, which could delay your coverage start.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf on pages 12, row 1-2, if you are unable to work due to injury, sickness, temporary layoff, or leave of absence, your insurance coverage will only commence upon your return to active employment.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf on pages 12, rows 1-3, if an employee experiences a temporary layoff and timely premium payments are maintained, coverage will extend through the month immediately following the one in which the layoff begins. This policy does not specify further coverage details for subsequent months should the layoff persist.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, during a leave of absence, if premium payments are made, the coverage continues through the month that immediately succeeds the month your leave commences. This provision applies from June 1st, 2005 (Revision 1).
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860 on page 13 rows 1-8, any increase or additional coverage commences immediately if you're employed actively, on a covered layoff, or leave. However, if your absence is due to injury or illness, the added coverage begins upon your return to active employment. Conversely, any decrease in coverage takes effect promptly but does not impact a claim already in progress prior to the reduction.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, your coverage terminates upon the earliest of: cancellation of the policy or plan, your removal from an eligible group, cessation of coverage for your group, the end of any required contribution periods, or the day you cease active employment (except during covered layoff or leave). Notably, Unum will provide coverage for claims submitted during the period when you are covered under the policy or plan.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, legal action on your claim can be initiated within 60 days following the submission of proof of claim or up to 3 years from the required date for providing proof of claim, except where federal law provides otherwise. This timeframe may vary based on specific circumstances outlined in federal regulations.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860 on page 13 (rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15), any statements made in a signed application for coverage are considered representations, not warranties. If these statements are found to be incomplete or untrue at the time they're made, Unum may either reduce or deny a claim, or cancel coverage from the original effective date. Only statements in a signed application will be used as a basis for this action. Incorrect information provided by the Employer will be utilized to decide coverage and premium amounts, with a fair adjustment of the premium made accordingly.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf on page 14, rows [1-11], Unum vows to combat insurance fraud by employing all feasible methods for detection, investigation, and prosecution. It is unlawful to intentionally mislead, deceive, or defraud Unum with false, incomplete, or misleading information when filing a claim. Acts of insurance fraud may result in denied claims, legal action, and punishment under state and federal laws. In cases of fraud, Unum will pursue legal remedies to the fullest extent possible.

Under Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, it is stated that any workers' compensation or state disability insurance coverage requirements are neither replaced nor affected by this policy. This implies that concurrent benefits may be claimable if eligible for both this insurance and such statutory disability programs.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, your employer represents either itself or you in relation to the policy. Under no circumstances will they act as an agent for Unum. This policy update was made on June 1st, 2005, with revisions included (REV 1).
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, disability is defined as a limitation from performing the material and substantial duties of your regular occupation due to sickness or injury, accompanied by a 20% or more loss in indexed monthly earnings. For employees eligible under all groups, this applies after 24 months of payments when you are unable to perform the duties of any gainful occupation for which you are reasonably fitted by education, training or experience. Regular physician care is required, and Unum has the right to examine you by a physician, medical practitioner, or vocational expert at their discretion. Examinations can occur as often as deemed necessary, and interviews with an authorized Unum Representative may also be required. This policy was revised on 6/1/2005 (LTD-BEN-2).
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, if you qualify for benefits under items 1, 2, or 3 in the deductible sources of income section and these benefits have not been awarded, denied, or are being appealed, your Long Term Disability payment may be reduced by the estimated amount. However, if you apply for these disability payments, appeal any denials to all necessary administrative levels, and sign Unum's payment option form promising to repay any overpayment caused by an award, your Long Term Disability payment will not be reduced.

Upon receiving proof of awarded benefits or completion of all necessary appeals if benefits have been denied, your payment will be adjusted, and you may receive a lump sum refund of the estimated amount. Any lump sum received from deductible sources of income will be pro-rated over a reasonable time period if no time period is stated. If your Long Term Disability payment has been reduced by an estimated amount, it will be reinstated once proof or completion of necessary appeals is provided. The policy was revised on June 1, 2005.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, if you're disabled while employed, your disability days will contribute to your elimination period. This means that the time you spend unable to work due to disability, even if you're still earning an income, is accounted for in meeting the required duration before benefits are activated. The number of days needed for this elimination period may vary based on the specific policy terms.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, payments will be issued once your claim is approved, contingent upon meeting the elimination period and if you are deemed disabled. The payment schedule is monthly for any duration that Unum is responsible for.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, payments for disability are determined by physicians and administrative officers. If you're disabled, they will consider your regular monthly earnings (excluding overtime and bonuses) during the base period - the first 52 weeks prior to your disability start date. The base earnings can be up to $12,086 per month. Your payment is calculated as a percentage of these base earnings: for Short-Term Disability (STD), it's 60%, and for Long-Term Disability (LTD), it's 60% for the first 24 months then 45% thereafter. These percentages may differ based on your specific policy. Payments will be made monthly and can continue until you reach the maximum benefit period stated in your policy or until you return to work, whichever comes first.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 4702860, page 16, row 16, the monthly disability benefit amount you receive will be determined by comparing the answer from Item 1 (specified in the policy) to the maximum monthly benefit. The lesser of these two figures constitutes your gross disability payment. It is essential to remember that any deductions for applicable taxes and prior payments could further affect the actual amount you receive. Furthermore, it is crucial to review this information carefully as it may impact your financial situation during a period of disability.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4702860, your monthly payment (Item 4) is determined. Importantly, this payment is subject to deductions for any sources of income that may be available to you during your disability period. This means the amount you receive will be reduced by any earnings or benefits you are eligible for from other sources. It's essential to report all such income promptly to ensure an accurate calculation of your disability benefit. Keep in mind, this policy is subject to specific terms and conditions that may affect your payment, so it's advisable to carefully review the entire document.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, the total monthly benefit received from this plan will not surpass 100% of your earnings, regardless of any other benefits provided. If you participate in Unum's Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program, this limit is raised to 110%. These percentages are effective as of June 1, 2005, with revisions made once.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, the term "Monthly Earnings" refers to your pre-tax income from employment during the calendar year preceding your disability, as stated in the income box on your W-2 form or calculated based on your earnings if a W-2 wasn't available. This figure includes wages, tips, and other compensations but excludes contributions to a qualified deferred compensation plan, Section 125 plan, flexible spending account, car allowances, housing allowances, moving allowances, Employer contributions to a deferred compensation plan, or income from sources other than your employer. The average gross monthly income is the total income before taxes.
<EOS>
During a covered layoff or leave of absence as outlined in Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, if you become disabled, your monthly earnings from your employer effective immediately prior to the start of your absence will be used for disability benefit calculations.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, if you become disabled due to the same sickness or injury and your monthly disability earnings are less than 20% of your indexed monthly earnings, Unum will send a monthly payment. If your disability earnings range between 20% and 80% of your indexed monthly earnings, Unum will pay a monthly amount based on the condition that during the initial 12 months while working, the combined total (disability earnings plus gross disability payment) does not surpass 100% of the indexed monthly earnings. This means that your payment won't be reduced as long as this combined total remains below the threshold.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, if the answer from Item 1 is equal to or less than 100% of your indexed monthly earnings, no further reduction in your monthly payment will occur. Conversely, if the answer exceeds 100%, the excess percentage is subtracted from your monthly payment. After a year of payments while working, you become eligible for payments proportional to the disability-related income loss percentage. This policy is outlined on pages 17, rows 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, and 23.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, if you file a Long-Term Disability (LTD) claim under the LTD-BEN-4 plan (revised 2005), your disability earnings will be subtracted from your indexed monthly earnings for benefits calculation. Specifically, the policy states that the total of your indexed monthly earnings and any concurrent state disability payments will first be determined; then, your LTD benefit amount will be 60% of the remaining sum. This policy is effective as of June 1st, 2005.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, section 2 at row 2 on page 18, the benefit you receive is a percentage of your lost earnings. To determine this, your total benefit is divided by your indexed monthly earnings. This policy's specific terms and conditions apply if you become disabled and are unable to work as outlined in the policy. The exact percentage of your lost earnings that the policy will provide may vary depending on individual circumstances, as defined within the policy terms.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4702860.pdfs' specified rows on page 18, your monthly disability payment is determined and may necessitate quarterly proof of earnings. The payment adjusts based on this quarterly income. Financial records may be requested to substantiate your income, deemed necessary by Unum. After the elimination period, if you are disabled for less than a month, you receive 1/30 of your monthly payment for each day of disability.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, if your disability earnings fluctuate significantly from month to month, the policy may average your earnings over the last three months to decide whether your claim should continue. Your claim will not be terminated unless the 3-month average of your disability earnings surpasses 80% of indexed monthly earnings. If this occurs, you will not receive payment for any such month. In these instances, the policy does not pay you during months where your disability earnings exceed 80% of your indexed monthly earnings.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, certain income sources may be deducted from your gross disability payment. These include worker's compensation, Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), and other private or governmental long-term disability benefits. The amount deducted will depend on the nature of these additional income sources. For instance, if you receive SSDI, Unum will subtract 85% of the SSDI payment from your disability payment. If you receive a combination of worker's compensation and SSDI, Unum will reduce your disability payment by 60% of the total combined amount received. The percentages may vary based on the specific income source. These deductions start once both the SSDI or worker's compensation benefits begin.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf at pages 18, rows 6-8, the benefits you may receive are determined by a combination of workers' compensation laws, occupational disease laws, and any other relevant legislation with similar intent. The total disability benefit will equal 2% of your average monthly earnings for each full year or portion thereof during which you were continuously disabled, up to a maximum of 60% of your pre-disability average monthly earnings. Benefits are payable from the date of disability and continue until the earlier of your return to work or the 24th month following your disability onset, unless an extension is granted due to inability to return to any suitable gainful occupation. Any benefits received under a workers' compensation or similar statute will be offset against the policy benefit.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, any disability income payments derived from state compulsory benefit acts or laws, other group insurance plans, or governmental retirement systems associated with your employer are not subject to the policy's benefits. Specifically, if you receive such payments following your employment with the stated employer, they will be offset against the disability income provided under this policy. This exclusion is effective from the benefit start date.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, pages 18 and 19, row numbers 18, 20-22, and 2, 1, your disability payments from the United States Social Security Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the Quebec Pension Plan, or any similar plan or act will not affect your benefits under this policy. These payments are subject to the provisions of LTD-BEN-5 (6/1/2005) REV 1. In case of a conflict between this policy and the aforementioned plans, the terms of these programs shall prevail.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf (page 19, rows 4-10), if you receive retirement payments under the United States Social Security Act, Canada Pension Plan, Quebec Pension Plan, or any similar plan or act, your children's benefits will be reduced proportionally. This adjustment is based on the amount of retirement income you receive, which may impact their payments until they reach age 18 (or up to age 22 if a full-time student). The reduction percentage depends on the specific plan. It's essential to note that this policy applies to both spousal and child benefits. Additionally, no reductions will be made if you are receiving retirement payments from any other group or individual disability income policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, disability payments received under your employer's retirement plan are defined as benefits paid due to disability and do not affect the future retirement benefit. These payments can be elected voluntarily or occur when you reach the later of age 62 or normal retirement age as defined in your employer's plan. Unum will consider both yours and your employer's contributions to the retirement plan to be distributed simultaneously throughout your lifetime, with exception to amounts rolled over or transferred to an eligible retirement plan under IRC Section 402. The definition of eligible retirement plan includes any future amendments affecting the definition.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 4702860.pdf on pages 19 and specific rows 38, 40, 41, 43, 44, and 45, your disability benefits will be reduced only by nondisability income sources. This excludes Social Security retirement income if your disability occurs past age 65, even if you were already receiving such benefits. Additionally, the policy specifies that retirement payments are not subject to reduction. These rules apply under the Jones Act for all disability instances except retirement payments.
<EOS>
This Unum Policy 4702860.pdf specifies that various income sources are not deductible from gross disability payments. These include but are not limited to: 401(k) plans, profit sharing plans, thrift plans (as of 6/1/2005), tax-sheltered annuities, stock ownership plans, non-qualified deferred compensation plans, pension plans for partners, military pensions and disability income, credit disability insurance, franchise disability income plans, retirement plans from other employers, individual retirement accounts (IRA), individual disability income plans, no-fault motor vehicle plans, salary continuation or accumulated sick leave plans. These sources are not to be subtracted from the disability payment in their entirety.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, the minimum monthly payment under the Minimum Benefit is either $100 or 10% of your gross disability payment. Whichever amount is greater will be applied towards any outstanding overpayment. This stipulation can be found on pages [20] rows [1, 3, 4, 6].
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, any deductible income sources subtracted from your gross disability payment will not further decrease the payment due to a cost-of-living increase stemming from that source. This policy applies across rows 1, 2, and 3 on page [20]. In other words, once the necessary adjustments have been made for deductible income, any subsequent cost-of-living increases related to those sources will not affect your disability payment reduction.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, the duration of your monthly payments depends on your age at disability. If you're under 60, your payment period extends up to the age of 65 for a minimum of 5 years. For individuals aged 60, the payment period is 60 months (5 years). At age 61, it reduces to 48 months (4 years), followed by 42 months (3 years and 6 months) at age 62. For those aged 63, the payment period is 36 months (3 years), 30 months (2 years and 6 months) at age 64, 24 months (2 years) at age 65, 21 months at age 66, 18 months at age 67, 15 months at age 68, and finally 12 months for those aged 69 and above.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, payments will cease on the earliest of several events: If a policyholder returns to their regular occupation part-time but chooses not to, or if they earn more than 80% of their indexed monthly earnings while working. The end of the maximum payment period, cessation of disability as defined by the plan, failure to provide proof of continuing disability, and residing outside the US or Canada for 6 months or more during any 12 consecutive months of benefits are other triggers. For policyholders ineligible in another group, payments stop after part-time work capability but choosing not to work, full work ability but choosing not to work part-time, or earning over 80% of indexed earnings while working. In all cases, payments cease upon the policyholder's death.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf on pages 22, rows 1-10, benefits for disabilities primarily based on self-reported symptoms or mental illness are limited to a cumulative maximum of 24 months. This applies regardless if the disabilities are not continuous or unrelated. Payments may continue beyond the 24-month period if you meet either of these conditions: (1) your disability is expected to result in death, or (2) you undergo an organ transplant. The policy emphasizes that benefits will be restricted to a maximum of 24 months for any combination of such disabilities.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, during confinement beyond the initial 24-month period, payments will continue. If you remain disabled upon discharge, a recovery period of up to 90 days follows with continued payments. If reconfined within that recovery period for at least 14 consecutive days, additional payments are sent during the subsequent confinement and an extra recovery period of up to 90 days.
<EOS>
This Unum Policy 4702860.pdf detail states that after receiving payments for a specified 24-month period, continued disability status allows for additional payments during any subsequent hospital or institutional confinement lasting 14 days consecutively. Payments will cease upon the completion of the limited pay period or maximum payment duration, whichever comes first. The mental illness limitation does not apply to dementia resulting from stroke, trauma, viral infection, Alzheimer's disease, or other conditions not typically treated by a mental health provider using psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or similar methods, as outlined in LTD-BEN-9 (6/1/2005) REV 1.

Furthermore, Unum will not pay benefits for disabilities resulting from a crime for which you have been convicted or any act of war.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, a pre-existing condition is defined as any medical condition for which you have received treatment, consultation, care or services, including diagnostic measures, or taken prescribed drugs or medicines within the three months prior to your coverage's effective date. Importantly, if your disability begins during the first 12 months following your effective date of coverage, it may be considered a pre-existing condition.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, if your disability recurs within six months after the end of a prior claim and you were continuously insured under the plan during that period, Unum will not require another elimination period for the recurrent disability. The recurrent disability is subject to the same terms as the prior claim and considered an extension of it. Any disability occurring more than six months after the end of the prior claim will be treated as a new claim, subject to all policy provisions including a new elimination period. If you become entitled to payments under any other group long-term disability plan, you will not receive benefits from the Unum plan (LTD-OTR-1, 6/1/2005 REV 1).
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, if you die while receiving disability benefits and your disability has lasted for at least 180 days, your eligible survivor or estate will receive a lump sum equivalent to 3 months of your gross disability payment. If there are no survivors or an estate does not exist, no payment is made. However, the policy allows for early payment if you're terminally ill, providing a lump sum equal to 3 months of your gross disability payment upon diagnosis with a terminal illness and life expectancy of less than 12 months. This benefit requires written election from the policyholder and physician certification, is available only once, and may be paid prior to death. If exercised before death, no additional 3-month survivor benefit will be payable upon death.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, when a policy becomes effective, coverage is provided if the insured is no longer employed due to sickness or injury and was previously covered under another policy (Section rows [1, 3, 4]). The new coverage is contingent on premium payment, with the amount equal to that which would have been paid by the prior carrier. Unum will deduct any liability owed to the previous carrier from your payments (rows [6, 8, 9, 10, 2]). This arrangement applies from June 1, 2005 (LTD-OTR-2 REV 1).
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, if your employer switches insurance carriers to Unum and you had a pre-existing condition, payments may be made. To qualify, you must have been actively employed and insured under the plan on its effective date, and insured by the prior policy at the time of change.

Your benefits will depend on whether you satisfy both requirements (1 and 2) or just one. If you meet requirement 1, payments are determined according to the Unum plan provisions. If only requirement 2 is met, the claim will be administered under the Unum plan provisions. However, your payment will be the lesser of:
- the monthly benefit that would have been payable under the prior policy had it remained in force; or
- the monthly payment under the Unum plan.

Your benefits end on the earlier of:
1. the end of the maximum benefit period under the plan; or
2. the date benefits would have ended under the prior policy if it had remained in force.

According to the Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, a 10% additional disability benefit of up to $1,000 per month is provided, unaffected by policy provisions that might increase or decrease the amount. This extra benefit falls under the Total Benefit Cap. Additionally, for three months following the cessation of your disability, monthly payments will be made if you're participating in the Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program and unable to secure employment. This benefit may be paid as a lump sum. However, should the company determine that you are no longer disabled while in this program, these payments will cease.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, the Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program benefits will terminate on the earliest of the following dates: (1) when Unum deems you ineligible for further participation in this program; or (2) any date where monthly payments would cease as per this policy plan. These benefits may end sooner due to your ineligibility or changes in payment schedules within the policy.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, while participating in the Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program, you are eligible for a Dependent Care Expense Benefit when disabled.

The amount you receive for long-term disability benefits can be significantly reduced due to these concurrent income sources.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, a Dependent is defined as your child under the age of 15 or any family member aged 15 years or older who requires personal care assistance.

This policy is outlined on pages [30], rows [46, 48, 49].
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4702860, a grace period is allotted for late premium payments. If a due payment is missed, the policyholder has up to 31 days (grace period) to make the overdue payment before coverage terminates. The grace period allows for continued coverage during this time without additional charges or penalties. However, any unpaid premiums beyond the grace period may result in policy termination.
<EOS>
Under the Unum Policy 4702860, Gross Disability Payment refers to the total benefit amount before deductions for any sources of income and disability earnings on page 31, row 2. If you receive other income or disability benefits during your claim, Unum will subtract these from your monthly payment. This reduction is based on a percentage that may vary depending on your specific case. The policy outlines the methods used to determine this percentage. It is essential to promptly report all sources of income and disability earnings to ensure an accurate calculation of your benefit amount. Failure to disclose income or benefits could lead to overpayment, which might require repayment or affect future claims.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, Hospital or Institution refers to an accredited facility licensed for care provision related to the condition causing your disability (row 5, 7, page 31). These facilities must be duly accredited and licensed, and the treatment provided within them should be associated with the disabling condition (row 5, 7, page 31).
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, "Indexed Monthly Earnings" refers to your earnings adjusted annually based on the lesser of 10% or the increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U) published by the U.S. Department of Labor. The indexed monthly earnings may either rise or remain unchanged but will never decrease.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf on pages 17, rows 3-4, eligible employee classes for insurance are specified in a schedule. The company retains the right to review and terminate any or all of these covered classes if they no longer comply with the policy's terms and conditions.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, an employee becomes eligible for coverage under this policy on the later of two dates: either the date of policy issue or upon completion of the waiting period. The waiting period, however, requires the elapsed passage of specific timeframes as per the policy's guidelines before coverage takes effect. Additionally, the policy outlines certain conditions and requirements that must be met for an employee to qualify for coverage. The duration of the waiting period and the particular conditions vary based on the nature of insurance chosen, further detailed in the specified document sections.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, prior service in an Eligible Class may be applied towards the Waiting Period under specific conditions. These include:

- Rehiring a former Employee within one year after their employment ends
- An Employee returning from an approved Family or Medical Leave, either within the 12-week leave period mandated by federal law or any longer duration as required by a similar state law
- An Employee's return from Military Leave within the timeframe specified by federal USERRA law

In all cases, the Waiting Period is detailed in the Schedule of Benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, an Employee's initial coverage becomes effective at 12:01 a.m. on the earliest of the first day of the Insurance Month following their eligibility, their return to Active Work, or upon application, premium payment, or Company approval of Evidence of Insurability (if required). Increased or additional coverage also takes effect at 12:01 a.m. on the earliest of these same conditions, while decreases in coverage take effect immediately, regardless of the Employee's Active Work status.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Policy 4939955 specifies evidence of insurability is necessary under certain circumstances:

1. If an employee applies for coverage or increased coverage more than 31 days after eligibility, or enrolls after requesting to cancel, stop payroll deductions, or premium payments from the Flexible Benefits Plan account.
2. When coverage is elected following insurance termination due to cancellation requests, stopped payroll deductions, or missed premium payments.
3. If coverage lapses due to non-payment of required premiums.
4. For optional, supplemental, or voluntary coverage exceeding any Guaranteed Issue Amounts shown in the Schedule of Benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, on row 1, a Long-Term Disability (LTD) benefit is provided for an Own Occupation up to age 65 if the insured becomes disabled and cannot perform their specific job duties due to sickness or injury. The waiting period is 90 days. Row 4 states that after the first 24 months, if the disability continues, the LTD benefit will be provided for Any Occupation up to age 65.

According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, an Insured Employee may switch Eligible Classes. The new coverage will take effect on the first day of the Insurance Month that follows or coincides with the date of change, excluding instances outlined in the Effective Date provision for increases or decreases.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, if an insured employee's coverage terminates due to a break in service, they can reinstate the policy upon resuming active work within specific timeframes. This process, referred to as "reinstatement," allows for re-enrollment without satisfying a new waiting period or providing additional evidence of insurability.

Reinstatement is available under various circumstances: returning from an approved family or medical leave (within the 12 weeks mandated by federal law or any longer state-law-required period), military leave, other approved leaves within six months, layoff or termination within 12 months for any reason. To reinstate coverage, the employee must apply or be re-enrolled within 31 days of returning to active work in an eligible class.

Upon reinstatement, the insurance amount may not exceed the terminated amount. The reinstated months will count towards any unmet Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion period, and a new Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion will not apply to the reinstated amount of insurance, but will apply to any increased amount. This policy applies to GL3001-LTD-10.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf outlines the conditions for terminating coverage for an insured employee.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf on pages 19 (rows 31, 33), if an insured employee ceases active work, their insurance coverage terminates. However, continuation rights are available under specific conditions. The employee or their beneficiary may choose to continue the coverage by paying the premiums based on level or modified whole life premium rates. This option is available until the age of 65 or for a maximum period of five years from the date of termination, whichever comes first. Premiums are payable annually in advance and can be paid using the cash value accumulated or through other acceptable payment methods. The amount of coverage that can be continued is limited to the lesser of the original face amount or the cash value at the time of termination.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, disability coverage for an Insured Employee may be extended during the Elimination Period, provided the Company receives the necessary premiums from the Employer. Premium payments are waived from the satisfaction of the Elimination Period until the end of the benefits' payable period. Once this period ends, premium payments must resume if coverage is to continue. The coverage can be maintained during the benefits payable period without premium payment. If Total Disability prevents work, benefits will be paid for the duration specified in the policy.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Policy 4939955 detailing Family or Medical Leave indicates that if an Insured Employee takes approved leave, coverage can be continued until the earliest of: a) the end of the leave period granted by the employer; b) 12 weeks as required by federal law or any more generous duration mandated by state law; c) when the employee notifies the employer they won't return; or d) the start date of employment with another employer. Premium payments must be consistently provided by the employer during this period of continued coverage. In the event of extended leave, coverage may continue beyond disability benefits if less favorable.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.PDF, during an Insured Employee's Military Leave, coverage can be maintained for the same duration as an approved Family or Medical Leave. The employer is responsible for making required premium payments throughout the continuation period. Importantly, this policy only applies to specified military leave events under state or federal law.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, if an insured employee experiences a temporary lay-off or approved leave of absence (excluding Family or Medical Leave and Military Leave), coverage can be continued for three Insurance Months. This continuation begins upon the initiation of the lay-off or leave. To maintain this extended coverage, the required premium payments must be consistently remitted by the employer throughout the period of extended coverage. The policy was last updated on GL3001-LTD-10 04 19 06/01/12.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, under the conditions for continuation, an employer must not discriminate unfairly among employees in similar situations. Continuation of insurance may not be provided when an insured employee ceases active work due to a labor dispute, strike, work slowdown, or lockout. This policy is applicable on pages 20, rows 5 and 6.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, during a Disabled Employee's coverage, termination will not impact benefit payments for that specific period of Disability. This means that if an Insured individual is temporarily unable to work due to illness or injury, their policy coverage remains intact, and they will continue to receive benefits throughout this timeframe.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf outlines the conditions for terminating this policy. The Group Policyholder must provide at least 31 days' written notice before termination. The Company can terminate the policy if there are fewer than 10 Insured Employees, or less than 75% or 100% of eligible employees are insured, depending on the payment method. The Company may also terminate if the Policyholder fails to promptly provide necessary information, perform duties in good faith, or if the employer is no longer covered under state Workers' Compensation or similar programs. Termination is also possible if the Company ends all other long-term disability policies in the same state or if state law requires it.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, the Policyholder can terminate this policy by providing written notice in advance. The policy will then terminate either on the date the Company receives the notice or a mutually agreed-upon later date. However, termination won't take effect during any premium payment period. The Policyholder remains responsible for paying premiums up to the termination date. Premium payments made before termination are non-refundable.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf on pages 20, row numbers 50-51, if a premium is not paid before the end of the Grace Period, the policy will automatically terminate without further action from the company. The policyholder remains responsible for all premium payments up to the termination date. It's crucial to note that non-payment triggers this termination process.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf on pages 20 and 21, during a period of disability, an insured employee's participation will not impact the benefits received for that specific disability. This policy provision adheres to GL3001-LTD-11, effective from 04/20/06 and revised on 01/12/12. Benefits are payable regardless of participation during the disability period.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, coverage under this policy becomes effective only after the first premium is paid. To maintain coverage, the employer must ensure each subsequent premium is paid on or before its due date at the Company's Group Insurance Service Office. The payments should be made in U.S. dollars.
<EOS>
According to the premium rates outlined in Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf (page 21, row 9), the initial premiums for this policy are clearly stated on the document's face page. However, it is important to note that these rates may be subject to change over time.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf outlines premium rate change scenarios:

  1. The company may adjust any premium rates on various dates, including the policy's anniversary or a later-agreed rate guarantee date.

  2. Changes in federal, state, or local law affecting liability are also applicable.

  3. The company's liability changes when the policyholder relocates, dissolves, merges, or is added/removed from the policy; ceases to be covered by Workers’ Compensation or similar programs; or stops providing or reducing Sick Leave or Salary Continuance Plan benefits.

  4. Coverage for one or more classes can cease under this policy, as can changes in the number of Insured Employees by 25% or more from the policy's inception or the most recent Rate Guarantee Date expiration, if later.

  5. At least 31 days' advance written notice is required for any premium rate increase, except for specific agreements between the company and policyholder.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, the monthly premium for insurance coverage is calculated as Covered Payroll multiplied by the premium rate. Premium adjustments are made on the due date coinciding or following changes in an employee's insurance status, and these changes do not adhere to a daily pro-rated basis. For instance, if an employee's insurance begins or terminates, the corresponding premium will be charged or cease from the relevant due date. Similarly, when premium payments are made other than monthly, adjustments will take effect from the subsequent due date. These methods of charging premium are for accounting purposes only and do not extend coverage beyond its intended termination date. Each premium payment includes any necessary adjustments due to recent changes yet to be accounted for. If a premium adjustment necessitates a return of unearned premium, the maximum amount returned is limited to the prior 12-month period.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, a Grace Period of 31 days is granted for each premium payment due after the first. The Policy will continue during this Grace Period; however, the Policyholder remains accountable for paying all premiums for the duration the Policy stays active. This policy requires the Policyholder to settle outstanding premiums by the end of this grace period to avoid policy termination.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, if an insured employee becomes disabled, premium payments are waived starting from the first due date following the elimination period and lasting for the entire duration of benefit payout. Should coverage need to continue after a waiver period, premiums must be resumed upon their due dates. This policy applies to the GL3001-LTD-12 10 Any Occ, Standard Integ. plan, effective from June 1st, 2012.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf details the Total Disability Monthly Benefit for an insured employee. The benefit is payable after the Elimination Period if the employee is Totally Disabled, becomes disabled while insured, is under a physician's regular care, and provides proof of continued total disability and care upon request.

The benefit ceases on the earliest of: the employee's recovery or death; the end of the Maximum Benefit Period; or the employee's ability to engage in Partial Disability Employment, either in their own occupation during the Own Occupation Period or any occupation after this period. Proportional benefits are paid for a partial month of total disability.

The company may deny or suspend payments if the employee: fails to take a required medical exam without good cause; fails to cooperate with the examiner; postpones a required exam more than twice; does not provide additional proof within 45 days after request; or does not provide proof of application for any Other Income Benefits within 45 days after request.

Partial disability employment and benefit suspension dates are at the company's option. Additionally, proportional benefits are provided for a partial month of total disability.
<EOS>
This policy from Lincoln (4939955.pdf) specifies the Total Disability Monthly Benefit. It is calculated as a multiple of the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings with the Benefit Percentage, but capped at the Maximum Monthly Benefit. Other Income Benefits are subtracted from this amount. The benefit will not fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit unless the sum of the Minimum Monthly Benefit, Other Income Benefits exceeds 100% of the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings. The Benefit Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period are all detailed in the Schedule of Benefits.
<EOS>
This information is derived from Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf on pages 24, rows 6 and 7, detailing the ADL Benefit. The policy provides an Accelerated Death Benefit (ADB) for terminal illness or irreversible impairment, allowing early access to up to 90% of the death benefit sum. This ADB can be received in increments of $10,000 up to a maximum of $500,000 per request. To qualify, policyholders must have less than 24 months (60 months for certain terminal illnesses) left to live as determined by attending physicians. This ADB is available only once during the coverage period and is considered a loan that reduces the death benefit amount.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, an Insured Employee will receive coverage for Long Term Disability Benefits under the Progressive Income Benefit as follows: The effective date of coverage is determined upon either the commencement of the insured's disability or the policy's effective date, whichever occurs later. If this provision is added to the policy at a later time through amendment, the effective date of that addition will also be specified. The duration of benefits extends to age 65 or until the Insured Employee returns to work, whichever comes first. The percentage of the covered income replaced for the first two years of disability is 60%, which increases to 70% thereafter.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, an Insured Employee's effective date for this benefit will be delayed if they cannot perform the Activities of Daily Living or suffer from a Cognitive Impairment on that date. The employee will become insured when they can safely and independently perform all Activities of Daily Living without assistance or their Cognitive Impairment resolves.
<EOS>
Per Lincoln Policy 4939955, upon completing the Elimination Period as indicated in the Schedule of Insurance, the company will pay an additional monthly benefit to an Insured Employee who is concurrently receiving either Total Disability or Partial Disability Monthly Benefits under this policy. This extra payment is applicable if the employee can provide proof of either Loss of Activities of Daily Living or Cognitive Impairment (as defined). The proof must be submitted at the employee's own expense.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf on pages 23 (rows 28-35) outlines the Progressive Income Benefit. The benefit equals 10% of the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings, but it does not surpass the Maximum Monthly Benefit for Long Term Disability Benefits or $5,000 per month (whichever is lower). The Schedule of Insurance reveals the Maximum Monthly Benefit for Long Term Disability Benefits. Notably, this benefit remains unaffected by any Other Income Benefits or earnings from any form of employment.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, the Progressive Income Benefit terminates upon the earliest occurrence of:

1. The Insured Employee's recovery from Loss of Activities of Daily Living or Cognitive Impairment (as defined).
2. The cessation of Total Disability or Partial Disability Monthly Benefits under this Policy for the Insured Employee.
3. The expiration of the Maximum Benefit Period, or
4. The death of the Insured Employee.

In case this policy includes a Family Income Benefit, the Eligible Surviving Spouse or Children will not receive increased payments due to the Insured Employee's receipt of the Progressive Income Benefit.
<EOS>
According to the 'Loss of Activities of Daily Living' section in Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, an Insured Employee is considered disabled if, due to an injury or sickness, they cannot safely and independently perform at least two out of six essential daily living activities without substantial assistance from another person. The activities include personal hygiene, continence, transferring (e.g., moving in and out of bed), dressing, eating, and maintaining safe surroundings. If the Insured Employee requires hands-on help for most of these activities, they are considered to have lost these abilities. This section defines disability under the policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, bathing involves cleaning oneself in a tub, shower, or through sponge baths with or without equipment on row 60, page 23.

It also includes the use of any required bathing equipment, but exclusions may apply due to specific policy terms and conditions. This coverage is subject to the policy terms and limits specified in your policy contract.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.PDF on pages 23 (rows 62 and 63), the coverage extends to braces or artificial limbs that are usually worn. This implies that these specific aids, when medically necessary, are included in the policy's scope. The policy does not differentiate between various types of braces or limbs but rather focuses on those routinely used by the insured individual.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf on page 23, row 65, the policy covers assistance related to toileting, including getting on and off the toilet, as well as performing associated personal hygiene tasks. The policy provides coverage for these services up to a maximum percentage based on the individual's level of disability. For example, if an individual requires extensive or constant supervision due to their condition, they may receive 100% reimbursement for related costs. However, if an individual only needs occasional assistance, they may receive a lower percentage of reimbursement. This coverage is subject to the policy's overall limits and duration.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, page 23 rows 67-69, the policy covers mobility assistance during transitions in and out of beds, chairs, or wheelchairs. This may involve using devices such as canes, walkers, crutches, grab bars, and other support equipment, or mechanical/motorized aids. The coverage applies to both short-term and long-term use of these items for individuals requiring assistance due to injury, illness, or disability. Additionally, the policy specifies that any medical devices or adaptations required for safe mobility will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf at pages 23 and rows 71-72, continence refers to the ability to control bladder and bowel functions voluntarily.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, under the 'Eating' section ([23, 24] pages, rows [74, 75, 3]), obtaining nourishment is defined as consuming food prepared and made available through conventional means such as eating from a table, tray, or container like a bowl or cup, or utilizing special equipment such as feeding tubes or intravenous tubes (GL3001-LTD-12D 01). This policy requirement emphasizes the importance of proper consumption methods in the context of insurance coverage.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, cognitive impairment refers to a permanent deterioration or loss of cognitive or intellectual capacity in the Insured Employee, resulting from moderate to severe head trauma, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, or other irreversible dementia. This impairment necessitates another person's active, hands-on assistance or verbal cues to prevent harm, diagnosed by a Physician based on clinical evidence and reliable standardized tests of short/long-term memory, orientation, and deductive reasoning.

In accordance with Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, a 'Pre-Existing Condition' refers to any illness or injury for which the insured received treatment within 12 months prior to their policy effective date. This treatment can encompass physician consultations, care and services, diagnostic measures, and the prescription, refill, or consumption of prescribed drugs or medicines. Any such conditions are not covered under this policy unless they meet specified exception criteria.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Policy 4939955 on pages 24, rows 40, this policy does not provide coverage during a period of disability that commences before the insured's effective date of coverage under this benefit. This means if an individual becomes disabled prior to the activation of their insurance, they will not receive benefits from this policy. The critical date for determining eligibility is the effective date of coverage specified in the policy.
<EOS>
According to the specified section of Lincoln Policy 4939955, benefits for Loss of Activities of Daily Living or Cognitive impairment are not payable if the impairment is caused, contributed to, or results from a Pre-Existing Condition within the first 24 months following the Insured Employee's effective date. However, this exclusion is waived if the condition has not received any Treatment during the 6 consecutive months following the effective date under this benefit.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, Disability benefits will not be paid during a period of disability that is caused or exacerbated by Mental Sickness, alcoholism, or the voluntary use of Controlled Substances.

This information from Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf outlines the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit. To qualify, an Insured Employee must be under a physician's regular care, engaged in Partial Disability Employment with at least 20% Predisability Income, and provide proof of continued disability upon request. The Elimination Period may consist of days of Total or Partial Disability, or both.

The benefit ceases when the Insured Employee is no longer partially disabled or dies, the Maximum Benefit Period ends, or they earn more than 99% of Predisability Income after 24 months, or 85% after the same period. The employee can choose not to work full-time in their own occupation during the Own Occupation Period or any occupation post-Own Occupation Period.

Proportional benefits are paid for partial months of disability, and payments may be denied or suspended for various reasons such as failing a required medical exam without good cause, failing to cooperate with the examiner, postponing an exam more than twice, not providing additional proof within 45 days, or not providing proof of application for Other Income Benefits within 45 days.

Under the Progressive Calculation section of Lincoln Policy 4939955, specific to Classes 1 and 2 (GL3001-LTD-13.4), the policy outlines certain terms for long-term disability benefits. If a claimant becomes disabled due to sickness or injury, they may receive 60% of their monthly base salary up to $6,000 per month. This benefit is subject to review every three years.

<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf at pages 26, rows 5, 6, 8, and 10, the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit compensates for lost income during partial disability. This benefit is capped at the Total Disability Monthly Benefit, which would otherwise be paid in full for total disability without employment. Therefore, the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit equates to the lesser of either A or B: A being a specified percentage of the Insured Employee's pre-disability earnings or B being the amount equal to the Total Disability Monthly Benefit minus any other disability benefits currently received. These payments continue until the end of the benefit period, which is typically two years from the date of disability onset.
<EOS>
This policy from Lincoln (4939955) on page 26, rows 12 and 14, specifies that the calculation of Lost Income benefits involves deducting all other income, including benefits derived from Partial Disability Employment. These benefits are subject to a maximum percentage, typically 80%, of the pre-disability income. The policy also outlines that such benefits may not exceed a specific period, usually two years following the onset of disability. Additionally, it's important to note that this policy applies only to the Insured Employee as detailed in the document.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf outlines the calculation of the Total Disability Monthly Benefit. The Insured Employee's Predisability Income is multiplied by the Benefit Percentage (limited to the Maximum Monthly Benefit), except for earnings from Partial Disability Employment. Other Income Benefits, excluding those from such employment, are subtracted. The Partial Disability Monthly Benefit ensures it's never less than the Minimum Monthly Benefit. All relevant figures - Benefit Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period - can be found in the Schedule of Benefits (GL3001-LTD-14-INT 10 Any Occ, Prim & Fam SS Integ. 26 06/01/12). The Benefit Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period are subject to change based on the policy's provisions.
<EOS>
According to the specified sections of Lincoln Policy 4939955 on pages 27 rows 4, 5, and 6, any additional income an insured employee receives will impact their monthly benefit. This includes benefits, awards, settlements, or earnings derived from specific sources, excluding Retirement Benefits and regular Earnings. However, such income must stem from the same disability for which a monthly benefit is claimable under this policy. In calculating the monthly benefit, the additional income will be offset.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf on pages 27 (rows 9-21) outlines the Workers' Compensation coverage.

This document, Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, outlines various compulsory benefits the Insured Employee may be entitled to under relevant state laws. These benefits encompass temporary disability income, mandated by certain state regulations, no-fault auto insurance laws, and any other compulsory benefit acts or legislation. The employee's eligibility for these benefits may impact the disability income benefits stipulated in the policy. For instance, under state temporary disability income benefit laws, an employee might be entitled to partial wage replacement should they become temporarily unable to work due to illness or injury. Similarly, no-fault auto insurance laws, when applicable, would provide benefits in case of accident-related injuries, regardless of fault. It is essential to understand and comply with these requirements as they may affect the total disability income benefits the employee receives under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, any other group insurance plans (excluding credit or mortgage insurance) or no-fault auto plans that the Insured Employee may be eligible for will affect their disability income benefits. These other plans are not included in the policy coverage. The exact impact of these external plans on the benefits will depend on their terms and conditions. It is crucial to understand these plans' specific provisions to determine any potential overlap or conflict with this policy. Please refer to the mentioned page numbers [27] and rows [33, 34, 35, 36] for further details.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, if an insured employee receives Disability Benefits or Retirement Benefits under their Employer's Retirement Plan, these benefits will be offset by any other Disability or Retirement income the employee receives from the insurance policy. This offset applies to any Disability or Retirement income received on or after the effective date of the insurance policy and before the insured employee reaches age 65. The percentage of offset varies depending on the type of benefit and the time period involved, with details provided in the policy schedule. Additionally, if an insured employee dies before receiving their Disability Benefits or Retirement Benefits under their Employer's Retirement Plan, any surviving beneficiary may be entitled to receive these benefits, subject to the terms of the policy and the Employer's Retirement Plan.

According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.PDF on pages 27 and rows 46-47, Social Security and other Government Retirement Plans benefits will be offset in the event of an accidental death or dismemberment claim. The percentage of offset varies depending on the nature of the plan: if the deceased was receiving benefits before their death, the policy pays the lesser amount of either the benefit amount payable at the time of death under the government plan or 75% of the policy's face amount; if the deceased was not yet receiving benefits but was eligible, the policy will pay up to the amount the deceased would have received in benefits during their lifetime, which is calculated based on age, earnings, and other factors at the time of death. The offset does not apply if the surviving spouse or children are already receiving benefits under the government plan. This policy is subject to any applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations regarding Social Security or other Government Retirement Plans.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, if an insured employee becomes disabled, certain child benefits become eligible. The coverage extends to the employee's biological, adopted, or stepchildren under the age of 26. This benefit is contingent on the child being unmarried and financially dependent on the disabled parent. The policy provides a monthly payment equal to 15% of the disability income amount, subject to a maximum limit. The policy duration for this child benefit matches the insured employee's disability period or until the child turns 26, whichever is later.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, under unreduced retirement benefits, a spouse or child may be eligible if the Insured Employee is eligible themselves. This eligibility extends beyond the employee's lifetime, with survivor benefits available after their demise. The policy specifies that the retirement benefits for the eligible recipient are typically 60% of the Insured Employee's monthly retirement income at the time of their death. However, this percentage can be higher or lower depending on certain factors such as the age difference between the employee and the beneficiary. The eligibility requirements stipulate that the spouse must not be currently receiving a retirement benefit based on their own employment, while the child must be under 26 years old or financially dependent due to a disability. The start date for these benefits is determined by the age at which the Insured Employee retires and the terms of the policy.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Policy 4939955 outlines a clause concerning reduced retirement benefits for the Insured Employee and their spouse. These benefits stem from Government Retirement Plans such as the federal Social Security Act, Jones Act or Railroad Retirement Act, the Canada Pension Plan or Quebec Pension Plan, and any similar plans worldwide. By June 1, 2012, this policy has been integrated with Any Occ, Prim & Fam SS Integ.

The Government Retirement Plans include disability and retirement benefits from federal, state, provincial, or other political units of various countries. The reduction in these benefits is taken into account if the Insured Employee receives reduced benefits. This reduction can affect the total amount payable under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, the term "Earnings" encompasses any income an Insured Employee earns or receives from any occupation, as reported for federal income tax purposes. This includes a salaried or hourly employee's gross earnings (shown on Form W-2), comprising wages, tips, commissions, bonuses, overtime pay, and pre-tax contributions to Section 125 Plans, flexible spending accounts, or qualified deferred compensation plans. For proprietors, net profit is calculated from Form 1040, Schedule C. Similarly, professional corporation shareholders' net profit is also determined by Form 1040, Schedule C. Partners report their net earnings from self-employment on Schedule K-1, along with any W-2 earnings. Lastly, Subchapter S Corporation shareholders' net earnings from trade or business activities are shown on Schedule K-1.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf outlines exceptions to the Other Income Benefits, not included in offset calculations on pages [28, 29]. These exclusions encompass:

1. Cost-of-living increases in certain Other Income Benefits (excluding Earnings), effective only after the initial offset during a Disability period.
2. Reimbursement for hospital, medical, or surgical expenses, attorney fees, and other costs related to claiming Other Income Benefits.
3. Group credit or mortgage disability insurance benefits, early retirement benefits not under federal Social Security Act or Government Retirement Plan, contributions or termination benefits from the Employer’s Retirement Plan, and benefits from 401(k), profit-sharing, thrift plans, IRAs, TSAs, stock ownership plans, or non-qualified deferred compensation plans.
4. Vacation pay, holiday pay, severance pay, and disability income benefits under individual policies, association group plans, franchise plans, auto liability insurance (excluding no fault), except for auto insurance.

These exclusions are effective as of June 01, 2012 (GL3001-LTD-14-INT 10 Any Occ, Prim & Fam SS Integ.).
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, page 29, row 5, any Income Benefits that impact Policy benefits are subject to specific rules. If the Insured Employee receives Other Income after becoming disabled and during the receipt of Policy benefits, these Other Income amounts will be offset against the Policy benefits. This offset may reach up to 100%, depending on the type of Other Income received. The policy considers various forms of Other Income, such as disability benefits from other policies or government programs like Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). The policy will continue to pay the Policy benefits minus the offset amount, ensuring the total income does not exceed 85% of the Insured Employee's pre-disability earnings.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, an Insured Employee entitled to Other Income Benefits (e.g., Social Security) must timely apply, seek reconsideration upon denial, and request a hearing if denied again; the Employer is also obliged to cooperate in filing Workers' Compensation or similar claims. Failure to pursue these benefits promptly allows the Company to either deny/suspend Monthly Benefits or reduce them by an estimated amount.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, if a claim for Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits is pending, the Insured Employee must choose one of two options in writing:

1) Option 1 (no written election made): Monthly Benefits will be reduced according to this option.
2) The employee can elect to reduce their Monthly Benefit by a specified percentage, allowing for an increased Social Security or Government Retirement Plan benefit later.

If no written election is made, the reduction as per Option 1 will apply. Please note that technical terms such as "Insured Employee," "Monthly Benefits," and "Social Security" are integral to this policy section.
<EOS>
This information derives from the Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf (pages 29, rows 32-40). The Insured Employee may receive reduced Monthly Benefits due to anticipated Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits. The Company will make necessary adjustments to policy benefits and refund any underpayment in a lump sum upon receiving proof of the awarded amount or claim denial, along with completion of any required appeals.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, during claim processing, the Insured Employee may receive unreduced monthly benefits. However, they must agree in writing to refund any overpayment that results from receiving Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits in a lump sum. Failure to promptly repay an overpayment will lead to the Company reducing or eliminating future payments and suspending the Minimum Monthly Benefit application until the amount is repaid.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, lump sum payments of other income benefits are proportioned over the specified timeframe. If no duration is provided, the company will apply an estimated monthly deduction until full offset, basing this on their estimate. In cases where no prior monthly offset was in effect, the lump sum is divided over a reasonable period not exceeding 60 months or the Maximum Benefit Period, whichever comes first. This proportioning process ensures that the policyholder receives consistent portions of their benefits throughout the applicable timeframe.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, section on Cost-of-Living Freeze (located on pages 29 and 30, rows 62, 63, 1, 4, and 5), the amount for each Other Income Benefit, excluding Earnings, will be frozen upon first deduction. Any cost-of-living increases under these other benefits will not impact the Monthly Benefit further (GL3001-LTD-15 04 29 06/01/12). This policy provision aims to maintain the frozen amount, shielding it from any potential rise in living costs as defined by the other income benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf on pages 30, rows 4, 5, and 7, a Recurrent Disability refers to a condition that is the same as or related to a prior Disability for which Monthly Benefits were already paid. In such cases, benefits will be reinstated if the recurrence lasts more than 30 days. If the policyholder returns to work and then experiences a recurrence within 90 days, they may still receive partial benefits based on their earnings during this period. The benefit amount for a Recurrent Disability is calculated using the same method as the initial Disability. Additionally, the elimination period for a Recurrent Disability will be waived if it was served during the prior Disability, provided the new disability starts within 90 days of the termination of the prior benefit period. The policy also specifies that if a policyholder receives benefits for both a current and a Recurrent Disability simultaneously, their total monthly payment will not exceed the maximum stated in the policy.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, a Recurrent Disability is treated as a new Disability under specific conditions. To qualify for further Monthly Benefits following the end of prior Disability benefits, the Insured Employee must return to their Own Occupation on a full-time basis, working at least the Minimum Number of Hours Per Week specified in the Schedule of Benefits, and maintain this status for six consecutive months. A new Elimination Period is required before further payments are made. Additionally, a new Maximum Benefit Period applies.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Policy 4939955 detail states that a Recurrent Disability, following an initial disability, can be treated as part of the prior Disability if it occurs within six consecutive months of the prior Disability benefits ending. The Recurrent Disability does not require a new Elimination Period for benefit payments and shares the same Maximum Benefit Period and Exclusions/Limitations as the prior Disability. The Predisability Income used in determining the prior Disability benefit will also apply to the Recurrent Disability.

If the insured employee returns to their own occupation with the employer for less than six months following the end of prior Disability benefits, and certain subsequent events occur within that period (e.g., job unavailability, policy termination, new employment, no benefits under other plans), the Recurrent Disability will be treated as a prior Disability, and benefits will be reinstated without requiring a new Elimination Period. The same Maximum Benefit Period, Exclusions/Limitations, and Predisability Income will apply to the Recurrent Disability as to the prior Disability.

To qualify for Monthly Benefits during a Recurrent Disability, the insured employee or former employee must earn less than the specified percentage of Predisability Income in the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit section, and payments will be subject to all other terms of this Policy that applied to the prior Disability. This provision ceases to apply if the insured employee becomes eligible for coverage under another group long-term disability plan.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Policy 4939955 specifically excludes total or partial disability benefits under the following conditions:

1. As a result of war, whether declared or undeclared, or any act of war.
2. Due to intentionally self-inflicted injuries or active participation in a riot.
3. When the insured employee is engaged in committing or attempting a felony, assault, battery, or during incarceration for a felony.
4. If the insured employee is not under regular medical care by a physician.
5. After residing outside the United States or Canada for more than 12 consecutive benefit months, except for employment with the employer.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, any total or partial disability that is either caused or worsened by a pre-existing condition within the first 24 months after the insured employee's effective date will not be covered. A pre-existing condition is defined as one for which treatment was sought within 12 months prior to the effective date, and this includes consultations, care, services provided by a physician, diagnostic measures, or the prescription, refill of prescription, or taking of any prescribed drugs or medicines. The insured employee will only be exempt from this exclusion if they did not receive treatment for that condition during the six months following their effective date. This policy applies to GL3001-LTD-17 98 Specified Limit.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, under the section on Disability benefits (rows 4-11, page 32), Monthly Partial or Total Disability Benefits are payable, subject to policy terms. However, these benefits are only available for a maximum of 24 months per disability period unless the insured employee is hospitalized. The defined "Specified Injuries or Sicknesses" include mental illnesses and substance abuse. It's important to note that mental sicknesses and substance abuse are also defined within this policy. These benefits might be limited to 24 months for any one disability period unless the insured employee is hospitalized, effectively extending the duration of these benefits beyond the initial 24-month limit.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, if the Insured Employee is hospitalized at the end of the 24th month following payment for a Specified Injury or Sickness, benefits will continue until their discharge from that facility. However, these monthly benefits will not be payable beyond the Maximum Benefit Period shown in the Schedule of Insurance. It's crucial to note that this period may end before the employee's hospitalization does.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf specifies that a Hospital is defined as a state-licensed, Joint Commission-approved, or certified facility offering inpatient treatment with round-the-clock registered nursing, lab, x-ray facilities, and major surgery capability. It also includes convalescent or nursing care facilities recognized under Medicare, mental hospitals treating mental sicknesses, and substance abuse treatment centers. These Hospital types must adhere to the criteria stated within the policy's relevant page range [32] rows [25-41].
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, a mental hospital is defined as a state-licensed, certified, or approved healthcare facility (or its psychiatric unit) that provides inpatient treatment for mental diseases or disorders. At all times, this type of facility must have a resident psychiatrist available, either on duty or on call. This definition can be found on pages [32] rows [44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49].

This information from Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf (page numbers [32], rows [52-68]) defines "Mental Sickness" as any emotional or behavioral abnormality, disorder, disturbance, dysfunction, or syndrome, regardless of cause, including but not limited to schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, bipolar affective disorder, manic depression, psychosis, obsessive-compulsive, depressive, panic, and anxiety disorders. Such conditions are usually treated by mental health care providers like psychiatrists or clinical psychologists through methods such as psychotherapy or psychotropic drugs. Mental Sickness excludes irreversible dementia resulting from stroke, trauma, viral infection, Alzheimer's disease, or other conditions not typically treated with psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or similar methods by mental health care providers.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, a Treatment Center is defined as a state-licensed, certified, or approved health care facility (or its medical/psychiatric unit) that offers inpatient treatment for substance abuse and operates under a Physician-approved and supervised written plan. This definition is found on pages 32 and 33, rows 73 to 78, 3, 4, 6, and 7, from the policy dated 06/01/12 (GL3001-LTD-17.3 98 Voluntary Rehab.).
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955 on pages 33 rows 4-12, a Disabled Insured Employee receiving benefits may be eligible for Vocational Rehabilitation. This benefit includes vocational evaluation, counseling, training, job placement, job modification or special equipment, and other necessary services to aid the employee's return to work. The Company decides eligibility and the payable amount of this benefit.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, an eligible employee for this benefit must have a disability that prevents regular occupation performance and lack skills for any other gainful occupation post the Own Occupation Period. The individual should possess the necessary physical and mental abilities to complete a Program. Upon completion of the Program, they are reasonably anticipated to return to work considering their motivation level and demand for workers in the proposed occupation. The labor force's expected claim liability must be less than the cost of the proposed services. This eligibility is subject to the employee meeting all these criteria.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf (pages 33, rows 27-29), the Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit's payment does not exceed the company's expected amount. This benefit is not payable for services already covered under the Insured Employee's health care plan or any other vocational rehabilitation program. The company has the option to make payments directly to the service provider if needed. Note that this benefit will not cover services already paid or payable by another source.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Policy 4939955, during a vocational rehabilitation program approved by the company, the policy's definition of Disability is temporarily waived. This waiver pertains only to the rehabilitation period. Upon the termination of the program, the company will reassess the Insured Employee's Disability status and determine any Long Term Disability benefits payable, including their amount and duration.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, the Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit will not be covered for an Insured Employee if they fail to complete the Program without Good Cause. This means that if an employee does not fulfill the requirements of the program or has a legitimate reason for failing, coverage may still apply. The details regarding what constitutes 'Good Cause' are not explicitly provided in this policy excerpt. It is essential to understand that failure to complete the Vocational Rehabilitation Program without Good Cause may affect the employee's benefits as outlined in the policy.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Policy 4939955 defines "Good Cause" for an insured employee as documented physical or mental impairments preventing program participation, involvement in a medical program interfering with a program, or participation in another vocational rehabilitation program that conflicts with the company's program but is expected to facilitate return to work. Such circumstances must be proven through documentation and should not hinder the employee from completing the initially developed program by the Company.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf on pages 33 and 34, the term 'Program' refers to a vocational rehabilitation plan, jointly developed by the Company, the Insured Employee, their Physician, and any suitable employer. This program outlines its goals, specifies each party's responsibilities, details the timelines, dates, and costs of the rehabilitation services. The plan is tailored with input from all involved parties to facilitate recovery and return to work.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, if an employee becomes disabled and receives benefits under this policy, the employer may be eligible for a Reasonable Accommodation Benefit. This benefit reimburses employers for up to 50% of the costs associated with providing reasonable accommodation services for the disabled employee, but not exceeding $5,000 per employee or the company's expected liability for the employee's Long Term Disability claim (whichever is less). Eligible services include making the worksite more accessible, removing barriers, providing special equipment or training materials, and offering translation services. The company may also deem other services necessary to help the disabled employee return to work.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, an employer is eligible for the Benefit if they have an insured employee whose disability prevents them from performing their regular occupation at the worksite. This employee must also possess the necessary physical and mental abilities to carry out their own or another occupation at the worksite but requires proposed accommodation. The employee must be reasonably expected to return to work with the proposed accommodation. Additionally, the requested Reasonable Accommodation Benefit should be less than the anticipated liability for the insured employee's Long Term Disability claim.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, the written proposal for reasonable accommodation services must be a collaborative effort between the Employer, Insured Employee, and their Physician, when necessary. The proposal should clearly outline the purpose of the proposed accommodation, along with specific details such as the times, dates, and costs associated with these services. This information is crucial in ensuring the successful implementation of the requested accommodations.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, any accommodation proposal for the insured employee must be approved in writing by the Company. Once approved, the employer is responsible for providing and paying for the services, with subsequent reimbursement from the Company upon presentation of proof. The employer's compliance with this requirement is crucial for the Company to cover these costs. This process applies when proposals for accommodations are made by either the company, the employee, or their physician.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, dated June 1st, 2012 (GL3001-LTD-18), the Prior Insurance Credit section mandates that any previous disability insurance policy held by the insured must be presented for credit against the new policy premium. The insured has up to 90 days from the issue date of this policy to submit proof of prior coverage. The amount credited is calculated based on the ratio of the premiums paid under the old and new policies, with a maximum credit of 12 months' worth of premiums for any one policy term. This credit does not apply if there was a lapse in coverage for more than 30 days during the prior policy period or if the prior policy excluded own occupation or residual disability benefits. The credited amount will be reflected on the monthly statements and will be applied as a deduction from the premium due for the new policy.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Policy 4939955, specifically on pages 35 row 3 and 4, outlines the provision of Prior Insurance Credit to prevent coverage loss for employees due to a change in insurance carriers. Upon termination of the prior carrier's policy, credit will be given based on the employee's coverage under the previous policy. The credit will be applied to the new policy according to the coverage period and premiums paid for the old policy. The amount of credit may vary depending on factors such as the type of insurance, the effective dates of both policies, and the policy terms. It is essential to note that this credit aims to ensure continuity of coverage for employees during a carrier transfer.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, an employee is eligible for coverage if they were insured by a prior carrier's policy at the time of transfer and were not actively-at-work due to injury or sickness on the policy's effective date. The coverage provided will match that of the prior carrier's policy had it remained in force. The company will pay the benefit the prior carrier would have paid, minus any amounts for which the prior carrier is liable. This covers the period from the prior policy's termination to the earlier of the employee's return to active work or the policy's expiration.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf outlines disability benefits related to pre-existing conditions. If an employee was insured by the prior carrier's policy at transfer and is actively-at-work on the policy's effective date, benefits may be payable. The Company applies the Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion. However, if the Insured Employee cannot meet this Policy's Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion but can satisfy the prior carrier's pre-existing condition exclusion based on continuous coverage under both policies, benefits will be paid according to either this Policy without applying its Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion or the prior carrier's policy, whichever is less. If the Insured Employee cannot meet either policy's Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion, no benefits will be awarded.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Policy 4939955, specifically sections on row numbers 4, 7, and 8 of page 36, outlines the Three Month Survivor Benefit. Upon the death of the policyholder within three months of total disability, a payment equal to 94% of the monthly LTD benefit will be made for three consecutive months. This benefit is available only if the policyholder has been receiving Long-Term Disability benefits for at least six months prior to their death and if the disability began before age 65.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf on pages 36 and 37 outlines the Family Income Benefit. If an Insured Employee dies after being disabled for 180 or more days while receiving a Monthly Benefit, the company will pay a lump sum equal to three times their last monthly benefit. This "last monthly benefit" refers to the gross amount payable prior to death, with any reductions for Other Income Benefits or earnings from Partial Disability Employment excluded.

   The Eligible Survivor can be either the deceased's surviving spouse or, in their absence, their under-25 children on the date of death. If multiple children are eligible, payments will be distributed equally among them; otherwise, the company may appoint a representative to make payments on their behalf. This payment is valid and effective against all claims by others representing the children.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, the insurer will compensate an employee's family care expenses under specified conditions: when the employee is receiving either a Partial or Total Disability Benefit, and if they are terminally ill, suffering from cognitive impairment, or experiencing loss of activities of daily living. This Family Care Expense Benefit supplements all other policy benefits, without deductions for Other Income Benefits. These family care expenses are covered regardless of the disability status: partial or total. It is important to note that this benefit applies only when these specific conditions are met.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, the Insured Employee must regularly provide proof of Family Care Expenses incurred for a Dependent on a monthly basis. Acceptable evidence includes a signed receipt from the care provider, detailing: the Dependent's name and age; if the Dependent exceeds the defined "Dependent" age limit, the reason for care; dates, total charges, and payments for care; and the provider's name, address, telephone number, and either their Federal Employer Identification Number or Taxpayer Identification Number. If a Dependent's age surpasses the maximum specified as "Dependent," the explanation for care is necessary.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, on page 37 row 40, the Family Care Expense Benefit covers un-reimbursed expenses up to $250 per month for each eligible dependent. These expenses must not be reimbursable from other sources. This benefit is applicable only when the insured is employing an eligible dependent as a family care provider for the insured or a covered family member. The policy does not specify any duration limits, but it's essential to note that these expenses are subject to verification and approval by Lincoln.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, the Family Care Expense Benefit terminates on the earliest occurrence of three events: firstly, when the Insured Employee's Total or Partial Disability Benefits under this policy cease; secondly, when an Insured Employee's Dependents no longer qualify as Dependents according to the policy definition; or thirdly, after the Company has made 12 consecutive monthly Family Care Expense Benefit payments.
<EOS>
According to the details in Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, page 37 row 54, a 'child' in this context refers to the Insured Employee's biological child, adopted child, stepchild, foster child, or any child for whom they are the legal guardian. This definition is inclusive of all children under the policy, regardless of age or status, as long as their parentage or guardianship is established and valid at the time of application and throughout the duration of the insurance coverage.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, "Cognitive Impairment" refers to a permanent decline in cognitive or intellectual capacity, necessitating ongoing assistance or verbal cues to prevent self-harm or harm to others. This impairment is diagnosed by physicians through clinical evidence and standardized tests evaluating short/long-term memory, orientation, and deductive reasoning. It can stem from moderate to severe head trauma, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, or other irreversible dementia. The diagnosis date must be on or before the policy's effective date, and benefits may cover up to 60% of the insured employee's salary.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, a 'Dependent' is defined as the Insured Employee's: a legal spouse who resides with them and is incapable of independent living due to a mental or physical condition; children under age 16, unmarried children aged 16 or older residing with the employee and similarly incapacitated, or parents/parent-in-law incapable of independent living and also cohabiting with the Insured. All these dependents must reside with the Employee and have a mental or physical condition preventing them from independent living.
<EOS>
In Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, the term "Family Care Expense" refers to costs incurred for care of a Dependent by a licensed provider, who must not be a member of the Insured Employee's immediate family nor reside in the employee's home. This expense is subject to reimbursement under certain conditions when specified services are provided, such as nursing services, home health care services, or residential care services. The policy outlines a specific daily limit for these expenses and offers coverage up to a predefined percentage of the total eligible expense. It's essential to review the policy for full details regarding eligible Dependents, service limitations, and other requirements.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, a Dependent qualifies as 'Incapable of Independent Living' if they are Terminally Ill, suffer from a Cognitive Impairment, or experience a Loss of Activities of Daily Living. The policy defines 'Terminally Ill' as having a life expectancy of 24 months or less, post-diagnosis. A 'Cognitive Impairment' is characterized by substantial and irreversible decline in cognitive function(s), interfering with the performance of basic activities. Loss of Activities of Daily Living refers to the inability to perform at least two of six essential tasks: bathing, continence, dressing, eating, toileting, or transferring without assistance or hazard. The policy requires evidence supporting these conditions before any benefits are disbursed.
<EOS>
This policy from Lincoln 4939955 defines 'Loss of Activities of Daily Living' as the inability of either the Insured Employee or Dependent to independently perform at least two out of six essential daily tasks without requiring continuous assistance. These activities include bathing, dressing, using the toilet, transferring (e.g., moving from a bed or chair), eating, and maintaining continence. The inability to complete these tasks safely and completely, with minimal aid, will trigger this provision.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, bathing is defined as washing oneself in a tub, shower, or via a sponge bath with or without equipment. This policy covers the following scenarios: bathing at home, during hospitalization, or at other facilities, and specifies that coverage applies to injuries sustained while performing these activities. The policy requires prior authorization for certain circumstances and imposes a maximum duration for hospital stays related to bathing incidents. It's essential to adhere to these guidelines to ensure full coverage under the policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf on pages 38 (rows 50-51), the coverage includes medically necessary dressing of braces or artificial limbs regularly worn. This requirement applies when putting on, taking off, fastening, or unfastening these items.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, Section concerning toileting activities (page 38, row 53), the policy covers assistance with getting to, from, on, and off the toilet and related personal hygiene needs. The policy offers benefits up to a specified percentage for such services if they are required due to an insured's injury or sickness. However, these benefits may not exceed the policy's overall daily limit. Additionally, certain requirements and limitations apply, such as the need for prior authorization from Lincoln in some cases. It is essential to consult the complete policy document for specific details and exclusions.

According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, sections pertaining to moving within beds, chairs, or wheelchairs - either independently or with assistance using devices such as canes, walkers, crutches, grab bars, and mechanical or motorized equipment - are addressed on pages [38] rows [55, 56, 57]. This policy requires that any such movements must adhere to specific safety standards and guidelines for the user's well-being. It is crucial to note that coverage may be affected if these regulations are not followed diligently. Furthermore, the policy offers some flexibility in terms of the equipment used for assistance, acknowledging that various support devices may be required based on an individual's unique needs and circumstances.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf on pages 38 and rows 59-60, if an insured individual is not continent (i.e., unable to maintain control over bladder or bowel function), personal hygiene requirements include care for any catheter or colostomy bag. The policy requires that the insured maintains proper hygiene and care related to these devices in a timely and effective manner, ensuring they are emptied, cleaned, and replaced as necessary, following medical recommendations and guidelines. This requirement applies to both temporary and permanent use of such devices.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf (page 38, rows 62-63), nourishment consumption is defined as any method of ingestion following food preparation and availability. This can be achieved through dining at a table, using trays or containers like bowls and cups, or employing special equipment such as feeding tubes or intravenous tubes. These means are crucial for satisfying the requirement that sustenance should enter one's body to receive coverage under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, a terminally ill individual is one expected to pass away within 12 months, despite suitable medical treatment. This condition applies to both the insured employee and dependents.

This policy's Total Covered Payroll refers to the combined Basic Monthly Earnings of all insured employees, as defined under Lincoln Cert 4553645 on page 9, row 47.

According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the contract encompasses the insurance policy and its amendments, the policyholder's application attached to the policy, any participating employers' applications or agreements, and individual applications of insured employees. Statements made by both the policyholder and insured employees are representations, not warranties, except when contained in a written, signed statement by an insured employee, for which a copy must have been furnished.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, after a policy has been active for two years from its issuance date, no statement from the policyholder or any employee can be utilized to void the policy or reduce or deny a claim.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the company can only rescind insurance for an 'Insured Employee' without their written consent under two conditions: firstly, if the employee commits fraud or misrepresents material facts regarding eligibility or any other crucial details that would have led the company to decline coverage. However, rescission is not allowed due to an employee's failure to meet eligibility requirements when the policyholder has requested their inclusion under coverage. Secondly, rescission can occur if it solely results from the lack of advance notification of the employee's termination of employment. A "Material Misrepresentation" refers to an incomplete or false statement that led the company to issue coverage they would have refused otherwise. Rescission means cancelling insurance effective from its start date, and the company will refund all premiums paid for the rescinded insurance, less any benefits paid for the employee's claims. The company also reserves the right to recover any excess claims payments.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, if an Insured Employee's age is misstated, any benefits will be determined based on the amount the paid premium would have purchased at the correct age. This means that if the employee's true age was higher than initially stated, the benefits received may be less than anticipated due to the lower premium paid. Conversely, if the employee was younger than reported, the benefits could potentially exceed expectations due to the higher purchasing power of the premium paid for an older age bracket. This provision is outlined on page 10, row 43 of the policy document.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, it is clarified that the Policyholder may act on their behalf or as an individual, never as the Company's agent.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 10 and subsequent rows 49-52, the Predisability Income under this policy is denominated in U.S. dollars, while all premiums and benefits are required to be paid in the same currency.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, this policy provides benefits mandated by Workers' Compensation laws and state disability insurance plans.

If benefits are due for less than a month, they will be paid on a pro rata basis. Any remaining unpaid balance at the end of the period of liability will be paid upon receiving complete proof of claim and confirming liability again.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, benefits are initially payable to the Insured Employee while alive. Upon death, a Survivor Benefit, if applicable, is distributed as per specified guidelines. Any remaining benefits will be paid to the Insured Employee's estate. If payment needs to be made to the estate, a minor, or an incompetent recipient who cannot provide a valid receipt, up to $2,000 may be given to a qualified relative. In such cases, the company is released from further obligation regarding that benefit.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf details the Notice of Claim Decision procedure. If a claim portion is denied, a written notice will be provided, explaining reasons based on the Policy terms and internal guidelines. The Insured Employee can request a review of this decision, with additional information possibly required to support the claim. The notice includes the claim number, office address, and phone number. This notice is sent within 15 days after the Company resolves the claim or within 45 days after receiving the first proof of claim, if feasible. Important dates to note: 15 days for resolution and 45 days for initial proof of claim submission.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 12 and subsequent rows [33-47], the Company reserves up to 15 days for claim processing but may require an extension if necessary, in which case the Insured Employee will receive a written notice by day 15 after the first proof of claim submission, followed by notifications every 30 days until resolution. This notice explains what additional information is needed and when a decision can be expected. If no decision is made within 105 days following the initial claim or 60 days post-complete claim submission, the Insured Employee has the right to an immediate review, as if the claim was denied.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 12, rows 50 and 51, the Company may require additional information from the Insured Employee to process a claim. This data must be supplied within 45 days after the request, and any resulting delay will not affect the given time limits for claim processing.
<EOS>
Under Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the Insured Employee has up to 180 days from receiving a denial notice to request a claim review by submitting a written request along with supporting documents. The Company will review the claim and respond within 45 days or 90 days in special cases, providing reasons for their decision according to the Policy and internal guidelines. If the claim is upheld, the denial notice will detail further appeal procedures available, access rights to relevant claim information, and the option to request a state insurance department review or legal action. This process complies with GL3002-CERT-6 04 MN 12 04/01/11.
<EOS>
In accordance with the Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, if the Company encounters a special case necessitating over 45 days to process an appeal, it will extend up to 45 more days. By the 30th day following the request for review, the Insured Employee receives a written notice detailing the unique circumstances causing the delay, whether additional information is required to assess the claim, and an estimated decision timeline.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 13, rows 20 and 21, if additional information from the Insured Employee is needed for an appeal processing, it should be supplied within 45 days. Any delay in providing this information will not affect the timeline for appeal processing.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, in case of disputes under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), a plan participant or beneficiary must initially exhaust administrative remedies. This entails seeking two separate reviews of any adverse claim decision as outlined within this section. Once these requirements are met, an ERISA plan participant or beneficiary may file a legal action under Section 502(a) of the act.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 13, rows 31 to 33 indicates that the Company will relinquish any right to contest a claimant's failure to exhaust administrative remedies under ERISA. In such cases, the claim will proceed without the need for exhausting additional administrative steps or appeals before filing a lawsuit. The waiver applies only to the exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement and does not affect any other conditions or deadlines specified in the policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, if overpayments occur on short-term or long-term disability benefits, full reimbursement to the company is required within 60 days. Failure to reimburse may lead to: 1) reduction of future benefits and suspension of the Minimum Monthly Benefit until full reimbursement; 2) reduction of benefits under any group insurance policy issued by the company; or 3) recovery of overpayments from the Insured Employee or their estate. Overpayments can result from errors in processing claims, Other Income Benefits received, fraud, misrepresentation, omission of facts, or any other reason.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, any legal action to recover benefits must wait for a minimum of 60 days after providing written proof of claim. Importantly, such legal action can only be initiated within three years from the date the written proof of claim is required. This timeframe applies to the specific policy outlined in the document.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the insurance company retains discretionary authority over the policy. This includes managing the policy, interpreting its provisions, administering claims, and resolving questions arising under it. The Company's authority encompasses setting administrative procedures, determining eligibility for benefits, resolving claim-related queries, and deciding what information is required for these decisions. Moreover, the Company holds the power to resolve all matters when an internal review of a claim is requested. Any decision made by the Company in this regard is final and binding, though the insured employee has the right to seek review from a state insurance department or legal action (except residents of California). This provision expires on 04/01/11.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf (page 14, rows 4-5), certain employee classes are eligible for insurance under the policy. However, the company reserves the right to review and terminate any or all eligible classes if a class ceases to be covered by the policy. The eligible employee classes are specified in the schedule of the document.
<EOS>
According to the eligibility date section of Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, an employee is eligible for insurance coverage under this policy on the later of two dates: either the date the policy was issued or the completion of the waiting period. The waiting period lasts for a specified duration of 90 days, after which the employee becomes insured if they remain continuously employed by the employer during this time. Coverage may be initiated prior to the completion of the waiting period under specific conditions, such as during an open enrollment period or if the employee has a qualifying life event. The policy takes effect from the date of coverage activation and continues for the duration specified in the insurance contract.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, prior service credit can reduce the waiting period for benefits when a former employee is rehired within one year of their employment ending, or if an employee returns from an approved Family or Medical Leave within 12 weeks as mandated by federal law, or any longer duration necessitated by a similar state law. Additionally, this applies if an employee resumes work after Military Leave within the timeframe required by federal USERRA law. This provision only pertains to individuals in the Eligible Class.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf outlines the effective dates for coverage. An employee's initial coverage begins at 12:01 a.m., either on the first day of the Insurance Month following eligibility or their return to Active Work, whichever comes first. Coverage activation requires either a signed payroll deduction order or premium payment through a Flexible Benefits Plan account. Approval of Evidence of Insurability may also be necessary. Increased or additional coverage begins at 12:01 a.m., effective on the earliest of these conditions. Decreases in coverage take effect immediately, regardless of Active Work status.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 14 and 15 outlines the Evidence of Insurability requirements. An Employee must provide this evidence if they apply for coverage or an increased amount beyond 31 days after becoming eligible, or request to cancel, stop payroll deductions, or premium payments from their Flexible Benefits Plan account. Coverage may also require evidence when it lapses due to unpaid premiums, or when electing optional, supplemental, or voluntary coverage exceeding Guaranteed Issue Amounts shown in the Schedule of Benefits. These regulations are found in rows 61-78 and 1, 4, 5 on the specified pages.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf (page 15, rows 5-10), an insured employee may transition between Eligible Classes. Coverage under the new Eligible Class becomes effective on the first day of the subsequent insurance month following or coinciding with the change date, except for instances specified in the Effective Date provision concerning increases or decreases.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, an insured employee may reinstate their coverage following a break in service, family or medical leave, military leave, or other approved leave within specified timeframes. Reinstatement allows for re-enrollment without satisfying new waiting periods or providing evidence of insurability. The reinstated insurance amount cannot exceed the terminated amount.

Reinstatement is available:
1. upon return from an approved family or medical leave within 12 weeks (federal law) or a longer period (similar state law);
2. upon return from a military leave within the federal USERRA law's required period;
3. upon return from any other approved leave of absence within six months after the leave begins;
4. within 12 months following a layoff or termination for any other reason.

To reinstate, the employee must apply or be re-enrolled within 31 days after resuming active work in an eligible class. The reinstated coverage becomes effective on the date of return to active work. During this process, months of leave will count towards any unmet Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion period, and a new Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion will not apply to the reinstated amount of insurance, but will apply to any increased amount.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf outlines the circumstances under which an insured employee's coverage terminates. Coverage ends at midnight on the earliest of:

1. The policy or employer's participation termination date, retaining any claim made prior to termination.
2. The date when the insured employee's class is no longer eligible for insurance, if they cease to be a member of an Eligible Class, or on the last day of the Insurance Month in which they request termination.
3. Premium payment dates: the last day of the Insurance Month for which premium was paid on their behalf, the end of the period following the last required premium payment, or the end of a particular insurance benefit's coverage period within the policy.
4. The date of employment termination with the employer, unless continuation of coverage is provided below. An exception applies if the insured enters active military duty for more than 30 days, in which case they must provide proof of service for any unearned premium to be refunded.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 16, rows 31 and 33, if an insured employee ceases active work, their insurance coverage terminates. However, continuation rights allow for the coverage to be maintained in specific scenarios. The policyholder can elect to convert the group coverage into an individual policy within six months of cessation, provided they are under age 65 and meet certain eligibility requirements. Additionally, if the employee becomes totally disabled before age 65, the coverage can continue without any further premium payments. This continuation ensures financial protection for eligible individuals in these situations.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4553645 policy details disability coverage. During an Insured Employee's total disability absence, coverage can continue throughout the Elimination Period if the employer pays the required premium. After this period and until benefits end, premiums are waived. If coverage continues after a waiver period, premiums must be resumed once due. The policy further stipulates that if an employee experiences partial disability, continued coverage occurs without additional premium payments during both the Elimination Period and benefit payment periods. Premium payments will only recommence post-benefit period conclusion.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, during an approved Family or Medical Leave, insurance coverage for an Insured Employee may be continued until the earliest of: a) the end of the leave period approved by the Employer; b) 12 weeks as required by federal law, or more favorable state law; c) when the employee notifies the employer they will not return; or d) starting employment with another employer. Premium payments must be made by the Employer throughout this coverage period. Additionally, if an Insured Employee is entitled to Disability leave, they will receive a more favorable continuation, but not covered under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf (page 16, rows 64-67), during a military leave, an insured employee's coverage may be extended for the same duration as an approved Family or Medical Leave. To maintain this coverage, premium payments must be consistently received from the employer throughout the period of continued coverage.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 16 and 17, in the event of a temporary lay-off or an approved leave other than Family, Medical, or Military Leave, insurance coverage can be maintained for three Insurance Months. The employer must make premium payments throughout this period to keep the policy active. This provision is outlined on rows [69, 70, 71, 72, 1, 3, 4].
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4553645 document on pages 17, rows 5 and 6 outlines conditions for continuation of insurance coverage. The employer is prohibited from discriminating unfairly among similar employees during this process. Insurance can't be continued if an Insured Employee ceases active work due to a labor dispute, strike, work slowdown, or lockout.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf outlines the Policy termination process due to Company or Policyholder action, or automatic termination for unpaid premiums within the Grace Period. Upon such termination, each Insured Employee will receive a written notice at their last known address, at least 30 days before the effective date, unless the Company has evidence of a similar group plan replacement within 31 days. If the required notice is not given, coverage continues for 120 days or until replaced, whichever is sooner. The document also specifies that if insurance terminates, it will continue for 120 days in accordance with the Policy's terms, or until a similar group plan replaces it.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, during a Disability, an Insured Employee's coverage termination will not impact the benefits payable for that disability period. Specifically, if an employee becomes disabled and their coverage ends, they will continue receiving benefits throughout this time of incapacity. This provision applies only to instances when the employee's employment status changes due to a disability. No specific duration for the disability is stipulated in this section. The payable benefits remain contingent on meeting all other policy requirements and conditions as stated elsewhere in the policy document.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4553645 policy detail on Conversion Privilege outlines specific provisions for converting Term Life insurance coverage to permanent Universal Life Insurance. The conversion can be exercised during the level term period up to age 80, with a maximum conversion amount limited to the lesser of the policy's net cash value or the available conversion amount based on the current guaranteed universal life rates.

The guaranteed minimum death benefit amount for the converted policy is the same as the original coverage, and the new policy accumulates a cash value based on the greater of the daily values credited under the initial term life insurance policy or the current guaranteed universal life rates. Additionally, any outstanding policy loans must be repaid in full upon conversion.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, an Insured Employee's coverage terminates when they resign, are terminated (with or without cause), go on a lay-off or leave of absence, or remain on a lay-off or leave of absence beyond the continuation period provided in the Individual Termination section. Eligible employees can convert their long-term disability insurance to an individual policy without providing medical evidence of insurability. To be eligible for conversion, an employee must have been insured under the Employer's group plan for at least 12 consecutive months before coverage termination. The 12 months can be a combination of coverages from the Policy and any prior group long-term disability plans that it replaces.
<EOS>
This document, Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, details that within 31 days following insurance coverage under the Policy, an application for conversion must be submitted. The converted benefits and amount of insurance may differ from those stipulated in the existing policy. Note that these modifications could significantly impact your coverage terms.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the conversion privilege is not accessible for Insured Employees whose insurance terminates due to policy termination, amendments excluding their class, eligibility class changes, retirement/death, unpaid premiums, or disability under the policy. Additionally, this privilege is inapplicable if the employee becomes insured for long-term disability benefits under another group plan before 31 days from the original termination, unless otherwise specified. If an Insured Employee converts their coverage and then resumes active employment in an eligible class, their conversion coverage will end on the day preceding re-enrollment. Simultaneous benefits are not provided for the same disability period under both the policy and conversion coverage. This information is derived from rows 25 to 5 of pages 18 and 19.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the insurance company will provide a Total Disability Monthly Benefit to an insured employee under specific conditions: they must be totally disabled, become disabled while covered for this benefit, be under regular physician care, and submit proof of continued disability and medical care at their expense upon request. The benefit stops on the earliest of three events: when the employee is no longer totally disabled or dies, upon reaching the Maximum Benefit Period's end, or if they choose not to engage in Partial Disability Employment during the respective periods. Proportional benefits are paid for partial months of total disability. The company may deny or suspend payments under certain circumstances, such as failure to cooperate with required medical examinations or postponing them more than twice. Additionally, proof may be requested within 45 days after a request is mailed for additional evidence or proof of other income benefits application.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf document details the Total Disability Monthly Benefit calculation. The benefit is derived from the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings multiplied by the Benefit Percentage, capped at the Maximum Monthly Benefit. Other Income Benefits are subtracted. The benefit will not fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit, unless combined with Other Income Benefits it doesn't exceed 100% of the Basic Monthly Earnings. The Benefit Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period are defined in the Schedule of Benefits (GL3002-CERT-10 05 Any Occ Def. Res 19 04/01/11).
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf outlines the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit. To qualify, an insured employee must be under a physician's regular care, engaged in partial disability employment earning at least 20% of pre-disability income, and submit proof upon request. The Elimination Period can be satisfied with total or partial disability days. Partial Disability Monthly Benefits may cease on the earliest of: the date of death, end of maximum benefit period, when earning more than 99% for 24 months or 85% after 24 months, or if the employee is able to work full-time but chooses not to. Proportional benefits are paid for partial months. The Company may deny or suspend payments if the employee fails a required medical exam without good cause, delays a required exam more than twice, doesn't provide proof within 45 days of request, or doesn't apply for other income benefits within 45 days of request.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4553645 policy detail (pages 21, rows 3, 6, and 7) outlines the Progressive Calculation section (GL3002-CERT-10.4). The calculation is based on a factor of 20 applied on or after April 1, 2011. The percentage of this factor used to determine the premium will depend on the risk classification assigned to the policyholder. For instance, if the policyholder falls under the highest risk category, the premium would be calculated using a 90% of the factor. Conversely, the lowest risk category would utilize a 10% factor in the calculation. This progressive calculation system ensures that premiums are more accurately reflective of each policyholder's level of risk.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, during partial disability, the Insured Employee's lost income will be replaced by a Partial Disability Monthly Benefit that does not exceed the Total Disability Monthly Benefit, which would otherwise be paid in cases of total disability without employment. The Partial Disability Monthly Benefit equals the lesser of two options: A or B. Option A is the amount calculated based on the employee's pre-disability monthly earnings multiplied by a percentage (66 2/3%). If the calculation results in an amount greater than the Total Disability Monthly Benefit, then the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit will be equal to the Total Disability Monthly Benefit instead. This benefit is payable as long as the partial disability continues.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 21, rows 12 and 14, the Lost Income benefit for the insured employee involves their Pre-disability income minus all other income. This benefit extends to earnings from Partial Disability Employment as well. It is essential to note that any benefits received are subject to a specified percentage reduction based on the employee's concurrent earnings. For instance, if an employee earns 60% of their Pre-disability income during partial disability employment, the Lost Income benefit would be reduced accordingly. This reduction percentage can vary depending on the individual circumstances and policy details.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages [21, 22] outlines the Total Disability Monthly Benefit payable to the Insured Employee. The benefit is calculated as the employee's Predisability Income multiplied by the Benefit Percentage, but is limited to the Maximum Monthly Benefit. Other Income Benefits are excluded except for earnings from Partial Disability Employment. The Partial Disability Monthly Benefit will never fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit. These parameters - Benefit Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period - can be found in the Schedule of Benefits in GL3002-CERT-11-INT 10 MN Prim & Fam SS Integ. The stipulated dates are April 1st, 2011.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, specific benefits, awards, settlements, or earnings stemming from particular sources will impact the Insured Employee's Monthly Benefit amount. Exceptions include Retirement Benefits and Earnings. For all other sources, the amounts must originate from the same Disability for which a Monthly Benefit is payable under the Policy. Critically, these derived amounts are offset when determining the monthly benefit sum.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf details Workers' Compensation benefits, covering job-related injuries or sicknesses under various laws, such as Workers' Compensation and occupational disease statutes, the Jones Act, the Longshoreman's and Harbor Worker's Act, Maritime Maintenance, Wages or Cure Doctrine, or any replacement plans. Benefits can extend to partial or total disability (temporary or permanent), as well as vocational rehabilitation.
<EOS>
This document, Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, outlines supplementary benefits subject to compulsory state or federal laws. Specifically mentioned are temporary disability income benefit statutes and other compulsory acts (excluding those under Motor Vehicle "No Fault" coverage). The section highlights that these benefits may apply to the insured employee, contingent on eligibility. These benefits might include state-mandated temporary disability income, with details subject to the specific legislation in question.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, page 22, row 32, any group insurance plan other than credit or mortgage insurance is relevant for the Insured Employee. Eligibility for disability income benefits from such plans must be considered alongside this policy. The specific terms and conditions of these additional insurance plans will dictate the benefits received and the timing of those benefits. Important aspects to note include any waiting periods, benefit amounts, and percentages specified in the other group insurance plan documents. The Intercompany Exchange Ratio is also a factor, as it may impact the policy's calculation of the disability income benefits.
<EOS>
According to the Employee Benefit Plans section in Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf (pages 22, rows 35-36), disability income benefits for the Insured Employee do not include sick leave, salary continuance plan, vacation pay, severance pay, or pay for work performed during a Disability. Only benefits related to the specific disability income insurance are included. This means that these excluded forms of payment will not impact the insured employee's eligibility or benefit calculations under this policy.
<EOS>
According to the Employer's Retirement Plan details on Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, page 22, row 39, any Disability or Retirement Benefits received by the Insured Employee are subject to specific rules. The Benefits amount will be reduced if the Employee receives a pension or annuity from another source. This reduction follows a percentage based on the other source's benefits start date compared to the Employer's Retirement Plan benefits start date. For instance, if the other source's benefits begin before the Employer's Retirement Plan benefits, the reduction percentage will be higher than if it begins after. The maximum duration of these reductions is 5 years from the start of the other source's benefits. This rule applies only when the combined Benefits exceed a specified limit, which may vary depending on the Employee's age and service with the Employer at the time of benefit receipt.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 22, row numbers 42 and 43, government retirement plan benefits such as Social Security will be offset in the event of receiving disability or survivor income from our policy. The reduction percentage varies depending on the amount of your concurrently received benefits. For instance, if your combined monthly benefit amount is less than $1,750, there will be no offset. However, if it exceeds this amount, the offset begins at a rate of 50% and increases to 100% once your combined benefit reaches $2,450 or more per month. The offset percentage will remain constant for as long as you continue to receive both benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 22, row numbers 45 and 46, the Disability Benefits for the Insured Employee are detailed. In the event of the employee's disability, the child is also eligible to receive benefits. The benefit amount is a percentage of the employee's base salary, up to a maximum of $10,000 per month. Eligibility continues until the child turns 26 or reaches the maximum benefit period, whichever comes first. Additionally, there is a survivor benefit option available for the child upon the employee's death, with the same eligibility conditions and percentage calculation applying to this scenario. The policy also includes an option for the spouse to receive benefits in case of the employee's disability, but specific details about that are not provided within these rows.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, under unreduced retirement benefits eligible for the Insured Employee, a spouse or child may also be entitled to these benefits due to the employee's eligibility. This benefit is subject to certain conditions: (1) The survivor must not be remarried before age 60; (2) If the Insured Employee dies before retirement, the survivor can receive benefits at the same rate as if the employee had retired on the day of death; and (3) For a child, eligibility extends up to age 18 or 22 if enrolled full-time in an accredited educational institution. In all cases, these benefits continue until the survivor remarries or dies. The percentage of benefits for a spouse is 60% and 75% for a child.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf specifies that reduced retirement benefits received by the Insured Employee or their spouse may affect retirement benefits. Social Security and other benefits for a noncustodial child will not be regarded as Other Income Benefits. The term "Government Retirement Plans" encompasses disability and retirement benefits under four categories: 1) federal Social Security Act, Jones Act, or Railroad Retirement Act; 2) Canada Pension Plan or Quebec Pension Plan; 3) any comparable plan or legislation from other countries, states, provinces, or political units; and 4) any substitute plan. This policy is outlined in GL3002-CERT-11-INT 10 MN Prim & Fam SS Integ on April 1, 2011.
<EOS>
Under Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, "Earnings" refer to any income an Insured Employee earns or receives from any occupation, as reported for federal tax purposes. This includes gross earnings of a salaried or hourly employee (as shown on Form W-2), comprising wages, tips, commissions, bonuses, overtime pay, and pre-tax contributions to Section 125 Plans, flexible spending accounts, or qualified deferred compensation plans. Additionally, it encompasses the net profit of proprietors from Form 1040, Schedule C, professionals' net profit as shareholders on the same form, partners' net earnings from self-employment (Schedule K-1), and Subchapter S Corporation shareholders' net earnings from trade or business activities (also shown on Schedule K-1).
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, several types of income will not be considered Other Income Benefits or be offset when determining disability benefits. These include:

1. Cost-of-living increases in any Other Income Benefit (except Earnings), effective only after the first offset for that benefit during a period of Disability.
2. Reimbursements for hospital, medical, or surgical expenses and attorney fees and other costs related to claiming Other Income Benefits.
3. Group credit or mortgage disability insurance benefits, early retirement benefits not elected or received under the federal Social Security Act or other Government Retirement Plan, and amounts from Employer's Retirement Plans representing contributions or received upon termination without disability or retirement.
4. Benefits from 401(k), profit-sharing, thrift plans, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), tax sheltered annuities (TSAs), stock ownership plans, or non-qualified deferred compensation plans.
5. Vacation pay, holiday pay, severance pay, and disability income benefits under any individual policy, association group plan, franchise plan, auto liability insurance policy.

Exceptions to Other Income Benefits are detailed across multiple rows on pages [23, 24].
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, page 24, row 5, any Income Benefits that impact the Policy's benefits will adhere to the following rules: If the Insured Employee receives Public Disability Insurance (PDI) or Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), there will be an offset applied on the Income Benefit amount equivalent to the PDI or SSDI benefits received, whichever is lower. This offset percentage depends on the nature of the disability, with a 100% offset for total disability and a prorated offset for partial disability based on the percentage of disability rating.

In cases where both Policy income and Pension income are received, the Policy income will be reduced by the amount that, when combined with the Pension income, exceeds 85% of the Insured Employee's pre-disability income. This reduction will not apply if the Policy income is less than $400 per month or if the Pension income is less than $40 per month.

Furthermore, if the Insured Employee receives Other Income Benefits from any source other than the policy and PDI/SSDI, a pro-rata reduction will be applied based on the ratio of the Policy income to the total income from all sources. These rules are applicable throughout the period of disability and for a transitional period of up to 12 months following the end of the disability.
<EOS>
Under Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, an insured employee entitled to other income benefits is required to actively pursue them. For instance, if benefits under the federal Social Security Act are payable, the employee must apply promptly, request reconsideration upon denial, and seek a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (unless the company waives this in writing). Employers of such employees must cooperate when filing for Workers' Compensation or similar benefits. Failure to pursue other income benefits on time allows the company to either deny or suspend monthly benefits, or reduce them by an estimated amount.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 24 (row 27, 28, 30), an Insured Employee with a pending claim for Social Security or another Government Retirement Plan benefit must choose one of the following options in writing:

1. If no written election is made, the Monthly Benefits will be reduced according to Option 1. The reduction percentage varies based on the retirement plan: Social Security - 20%, other Government Retirement Plans - 50%.

The crucial date for making this decision is the later of the policy effective date or the date the Insured Employee turns age 62. The election remains in effect unless the Insured Employee provides written notice to change it.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the Insured Employee may receive reduced Monthly Benefits if they have estimated Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits. The Company will adjust Policy benefits and refund any underpayment, in a lump sum, upon receiving proof of either: a) the amount actually awarded or b) claim denial and completion of any required appeal by the Company. This adjustment and refund applies to rows [32-40] on page 24.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 24 and subsequent rows 42-48, the Insured Employee is eligible for unreduced monthly benefits pending a claim. However, if they receive Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits, they must promptly repay any overpayment in a lump sum. If an overpayment isn't repaid promptly, future payments may be reduced or eliminated, and the Minimum Monthly Benefit won't apply until the amount is repaid. Failure to do so could result in a reduction or elimination of future payments and a non-application of the Minimum Monthly Benefit until the overpayment is resolved.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, lump sum payments under Other Income Benefits are pro-rated monthly over the specified duration or a reasonable period not exceeding 60 months, whichever comes first. If no time period is provided, the company will continue its estimated monthly offset until the full amount is offset. If an estimated monthly offset wasn't being made, the lump sum is pro-rated over a reasonable period. No lump sum payment will exceed the Maximum Benefit Period.
<EOS>
In the specified sections of the Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf (pages 24 and 25, rows 62, 63, 1, 4, 5), it is detailed that after the initial deduction for all Other Income Benefits, except Earnings, the amount will be frozen. This means that further reductions to the Monthly Benefit due to cost-of-living increases under these Other Income Benefits are not applicable, as stated in GL3002-CERT-12 04 24 04/01/11. The freeze date is not explicitly mentioned, but the context suggests it begins after the initial deduction.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 25, rows 4, 5, and 7, a Recurrent Disability is defined as one that results from an Injury or Sickness that is identical or related to a prior Disability for which Monthly Benefits were already paid. To qualify as a Recurrent Disability, the current condition must match or be linked to a previous one for which benefits were disbursed. The policy does not specify a timeframe for when this recurrence can occur, but it is essential to note that if a Recurrent Disability arises, the original terms and conditions of the previous Disability will apply. Additionally, any payments made for the Recurrent Disability will be deducted from the Total Benefit Period remaining under the original policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, a recurrent disability is considered a new disability if the insured employee returns to their own occupation with the employer on a full-time basis working at least the minimum number of hours per week as shown in the Schedule of Benefits for six consecutive months or more following the end of prior disability benefits. A new elimination period must be completed before additional monthly benefits are paid, and a new maximum benefit period applies.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages [25, 26] details the Recurrent Disability provision. If an Insured Employee returns to their Own Occupation with the Employer for less than six months after prior Disability benefits end, any subsequent Disability is considered a Recurrent Disability. No new Elimination Period is required, and the same Maximum Benefit Period and Predisability Income apply.

If the Insured Employee does not return to work with the original Employer within six months following prior Disability benefits end, and other conditions are met (such as coverage termination or ineligibility for benefits under another group long-term disability plan), reinstated benefits will not require a new Elimination Period. The Maximum Benefit Period, Exclusions, Limitations, and Predisability Income remain the same.

To be eligible for Monthly Benefits, the Insured Employee must earn less than the specified percentage of Predisability Income in the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit section, with all other policy terms applying. The Recurrent Disability provision ceases to apply if the Insured Employee becomes eligible for coverage under another group long-term disability plan.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, on page 27, under row numbers 7 and 8, the ADL Benefit section outlines a daily living allowance payable upon meeting certain criteria. This benefit is triggered if an individual becomes unable to perform two Activities of Daily Living (ADL) without substantial assistance from another person or specialized equipment for a period exceeding 90 days. The amount paid will be a percentage of the base amount, which varies based on age, up to a maximum of $315 per day. Additionally, if an individual requires supervision to protect them from threats to their health and safety, this is also considered as one ADL. This benefit continues for the duration that these requirements persist, with adjustments made annually based on cost-of-living changes.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, an Insured Employee's coverage for Progressive Income Benefit under the policy becomes effective as follows:

1. If the Long Term Disability Benefits provision is already included in the Policy at the time of employment, the effective date is immediately upon hiring.
2. However, if this provision is added later by amending the Policy, the effective date for coverage will be specified in the amendment document. This amended provision will then govern any Progressive Income Benefit payments related to a disability occurring after the effective date stated in the amendment.
<EOS>
According to the Exception section in Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 26, rows 10-16, an Insured Employee's effective date for a specific benefit will be postponed if they are unable to perform all Activities of Daily Living without assistance or have a Cognitive Impairment on that date. The employee will become insured when they can safely and independently perform these activities or no longer suffer from the Cognitive Impairment.
<EOS>
Under the specified terms of Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, following the Elimination Period outlined in the insurance schedule, the company will provide an additional monthly benefit to the Insured Employee if they are currently receiving Total Disability or Partial Disability Monthly Benefits under the policy and submit proof of either a Loss of Activities of Daily Living or Cognitive Impairment (as defined). Proof of these conditions is at the employee's own expense.
<EOS>
This document (Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf) specifies the Progressive Income Benefit as equaling 10% of the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings, but not surpassing the Maximum Monthly Benefit for Long Term Disability Benefits or $5,000 per month (whichever is less), as shown in the Schedule of Insurance. This Progressive Income Benefit remains unaffected by any Other Income Benefits or earnings from employment.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the Progressive Income Benefit terminates upon the earliest occurrence of four scenarios: (1) the Insured Employee recovers from Loss of Activities of Daily Living or Cognitive Impairment as defined; (2) the cessation of Total Disability or Partial Disability Monthly Benefits under the Policy; (3) the end of the Maximum Benefit Period; or (4) the Insured Employee's demise. Notably, if a Family Income Benefit is included in the policy, payments to the Eligible Surviving Spouse or Children will not increase due to the Insured Employee receiving this Progressive Income Benefit.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the Loss of Activities of Daily Living policy pertains to an Insured Employee who, due to injury or sickness, can no longer perform two or more of the six daily activities independently and without substantial assistance from another person. The six activities include eating, toileting, transferring (e.g., moving from a bed to a chair), bathing, dressing, and continence. If an employee is unable to complete these tasks safely and fully, benefits may be triggered under this policy provision. This impairment must affect the employee significantly, such that they require assistance for most of the activity.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 26, row 60, personal bathing is defined as washing oneself in a tub, shower, or through sponge baths with or without equipment. The policy outlines that the insured can receive personal hygiene assistance, such as help in bathing and dressing, if deemed necessary by a healthcare professional. This service will be covered up to $10,000 per calendar year for home health care or $5,000 annually for residential respite care. The policy also specifies that the coverage applies only when provided by a licensed nurse, therapist, or other qualified professional.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 26, row numbers 62 and 63, the policy extends coverage to braces or artificial limbs routinely worn. The policy mandates that these items must be medically necessary for dress-related activities such as putting on, taking off, fastening, or unfastening garments. This applies to any reasonable adjustments made in accordance with medical advice and requirements.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on page 26, row 65, the policy covers assistance with toileting, including movement to and from, onto, and off the toilet, as well as related personal hygiene tasks. The policy provides coverage for these services up to a specific percentage, though this amount is not explicitly stated in the section. The policy also requires that any care provided meets professional standards and adheres to the individual's care plan. This provision applies from the policy's effective date forward.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, these provisions apply to mobility aids such as canes, walkers, crutches, grab bars, and mechanical or motorized devices for in-and-out bed, chair, or wheelchair transfers. The policy covers assistance devices needed due to sickness, injury, or physical limitation. It specifies that the policyholder is eligible for coverage up to a certain percentage depending on the nature of the disability or illness, as determined by the insurance company's assessment. Additionally, this section includes provisions for temporary and permanent use of mobility aids, with potential adjustments in coverage based on these factors. The policy provides clear guidelines regarding the duration and circumstances under which such equipment can be covered.
<EOS>
According to the Continence section in Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf (pages 26, rows 71-72), an individual's continence status is crucial for policy consideration. If one maintains control over bladder and bowel function, they are considered continent. However, if not, related personal hygiene, including catheter or colostomy bag care, becomes relevant. Importantly, these personal care needs may impact the policy's terms or conditions. The policy does not specify any specific durations or percentages regarding this requirement.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 26 and 27, under row numbers 74, 75, and 4, the policy defines nourishment as consuming food either from a table, tray, container (such as a bowl or cup), or with the aid of specialized equipment like feeding tubes or intravenous tubes. This implies that obtaining sustenance can occur through such methods to fulfill the policy's requirements.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, cognitive impairment in the insured employee is defined as a permanent deterioration or loss of cognitive or intellectual capacity due to injury or sickness. This requires another person's active help or verbal cues to prevent self or others from harm, resulting from conditions like moderate to severe head trauma, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, or other irreversible dementia. The diagnosis must be based on clinical evidence and reliable standardized tests of memory, orientation, and deductive reasoning. It is important to note that this definition applies only to the specified rows and page 27 of the document.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf outlines the definition of "Mental Sickness." It refers to emotional, behavioral, psychological, personality, or stress-related abnormalities that may not have a known cause. Included are conditions such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, bipolar affective disorder, manic depression, and various anxiety or depressive disorders, commonly treated by psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, or other mental health care providers via psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or similar treatment methods. However, it excludes irreversible dementia resulting from stroke, trauma, viral infection, Alzheimer's disease, and other conditions not typically managed using these treatment methods.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, a pre-existing condition is defined as any sickness or injury for which the insured received treatment within six months prior to their policy's effective date. Treatment encompasses physician consultations, care and services, diagnostic measures, and the prescription, refill, or ingestion of prescribed drugs or medicines. If you have sought such treatment before your coverage commencement, it may be considered a pre-existing condition and could potentially affect your policy's benefits or eligibility.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, page 27, row 40, if an insured individual has a pre-existing disability at the start of their coverage under this policy, benefits will not be payable during that period of disability. This applies only to disabilities that manifested prior to the employee's effective date of coverage. The policy does not cover any disability claims that are directly or indirectly related to such pre-existing conditions.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 27 and the subsequent rows 43-49, a pre-existing condition may affect the payable benefits for Loss of Activities of Daily Living or Cognitive impairment. This applies if the impairment is caused or worsened by a pre-existing condition within the first 12 months following the Insured Employee's effective date under this benefit. It's essential to note that any such impairment resulting from a pre-existing condition will not be covered during this period.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, on pages 27 and rows 52-54, disability benefits will not be paid if the disability is caused, contributed to, or results from mental illness, alcoholism, or voluntary use of a Controlled Substance as defined in Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, and any amendments thereafter. However, an exception applies if the Controlled Substance is prescribed by a Physician. These regulations pertain to your disability benefits eligibility.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the premium and other policy provisions are subject to the Definitions, Exclusions, Proof of Claim, and Waiver clauses detailed on pages [27, 28]. Premium payments must adhere to GL3002-CERT-13 10 MN 6/12 Pre-Ex stipulations effective from April 1, 2011. These provisions govern the entire policy's terms and conditions.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the policy excludes periods of Total or Partial Disability not covered due to:

1. War, declared or undeclared, or any act of war.
2. Self-inflicted injuries resulting from intentional actions.
3. Active participation in a riot.
4. The Insured Employee committing or attempting to commit a felony.
5. Disability periods when the Insured Employee is not receiving Regular Care from a Physician.
6. Disability occurring after the Insured Employee has resided outside the United States or Canada for over 12 consecutive months, excluding employment with the Employer.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf (pages 28 and 29) outlines the Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion. During the initial 12 months after the Insured Employee's Effective Date, any Total or Partial Disability caused or exacerbated by a Pre-Existing Condition will not be covered. However, if disability persists beyond the first 24 months, benefits will be payable for subsequent months. A "Pre-Existing Condition" is defined as a Sickness or Injury for which treatment was sought within 6 months prior to the Effective Date, encompassing consultations, care, services, diagnostic measures, and prescription drugs or medicines provided by a Physician. This exclusion may be removed if the Insured Employee's certificate has been amended accordingly. The policy also includes a Specified Limit (GL3002-CERT-14 98 Specified Limit).
<EOS>
This document, Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 29 and specific rows 4-11, outlines the limitations of disability benefits for an 'Insured Employee'. If a disability arises primarily from listed 'Specified Injuries or Sicknesses' such as Mental Sickness or Substance Abuse, monthly benefits will be payable according to policy terms but are limited to 24 months per disablement period. This limitation does not apply if the employee is hospital-confined. These 'Specified Injuries or Sicknesses' are defined within the document. The disability benefits duration may exceed 24 months for a hospitalized employee, with no specified limit in this case.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, if the Insured Employee remains hospitalized at the end of the 24th month following payment for a Specified Injury or Sickness, benefits will continue until discharge. However, these Monthly Benefits must not surpass the Maximum Benefit Period stated in the Schedule of Insurance. The policy does not provide coverage beyond this period.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 29 (rows 25-41), a 'Hospital' encompasses: general hospitals licensed, approved, or certified by their state; recognized by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Hospitals; treating resident inpatients with a registered nurse always on duty, a lab, x-ray facility, and major surgery capabilities. Also included are skilled nursing care facilities providing convalescent or nursing care under Medicare, mental hospitals for mental sickness treatment, and treatment centers for substance abuse treatment.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, a 'Mental Hospital' is defined as a state-licensed, certified, or approved facility in its location that accommodates resident mental disease or disorder patients. This healthcare institution must be equipped for inpatient treatment and maintains a resident psychiatrist on duty or call at all times. These facilities are found within the document's specified pages (29, rows 44-49).
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf describes "Mental Sickness" as any emotional, behavioral, psychological, or personality disorder or syndrome, regardless of its cause. Included are conditions like schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder, bipolar affective disorder, manic depression, psychosis, obsessive-compulsive, depressive, panic, and anxiety disorders. Treatment often involves psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or similar methods by a psychiatrist, clinical psychologist, or other mental health care provider. Exclusions are irreversible dementia from stroke, trauma, viral infection, Alzheimer's disease, or other conditions not typically treated with psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or similar treatment methods.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf (page numbers 29 and 30, rows 73 to 5), a "Treatment Center" refers to a state-licensed, certified, or approved healthcare facility or its medical/psychiatric unit that offers inpatient substance abuse treatment, overseen by a Physician via an approved and supervised written plan. This policy is relevant to GL3002-CERT-14.3 98 Voluntary Rehab, effective as of 04/01/11.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 30, rows 4-12, if an Insured Employee becomes Disabled and receives Policy benefits, they might be eligible for a Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit. This benefit includes vocational evaluation, counseling, training, or job placement; job modification or special equipment; and other necessary services to aid the employee's return to work. The Company has the authority to decide eligibility and the amount of any payable Benefit.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, an insured employee may be eligible for this benefit if they have a disability that prevents them from performing their regular occupation and lack the necessary skills, training, or experience for any other gainful occupation afterwards. They must also possess the physical and mental abilities needed to complete a Program and be reasonably expected to return to work after its completion, given their degree of motivation and labor force demand in the proposed occupation. The Company's determination requires that the employee's cost of services is less than its expected claim liability.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 30 and relevant rows 27-29, the Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit's maximum amount is contingent upon the Company's expectations. This benefit will not be applicable for services provided under the Insured Employee's health care plan or any other vocational rehabilitation program. Payments, should they occur, will be directed to the service provider at the Company's discretion.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645, during a vocational rehabilitation program approved by the company, the definition of Disability is waived during the rehabilitation period. Upon program completion, the policy's Disability definition resumes. The company decides any Long Term Disability benefits amount and duration after the program ends. These provisions are found on pages 30, rows 32, 33, and 34 of the document.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 30, row 37, if an insured employee receives a Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit, they will not be covered for any disability period should they fail to complete the program without substantial justification (i.e., good cause). This provision applies only to this specific benefit and its associated requirements.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4553645 document on page [30] outlines the definition of 'Good Cause'. It includes three main scenarios where this term applies:

1. If an Insured Employee has documented physical or mental impairments, preventing them from participating in or completing a Program.
2. When the Insured Employee is involved in a medical program that hinders their ability to participate in or complete a Program.
3. In case the Insured Employee participates in another vocational rehabilitation program in good faith. This other program must either conflict with a Program developed by the Company, and be reasonably expected to return the employee to work, or it should be one that the Insured Employee is taking part in good faith, which conflicts with completing a Program established by the Company.
<EOS>
This document, Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 30 and 31, outlines that a 'Program' refers to a vocational rehabilitation plan developed collaboratively by the insurance company, the insured employee, their physician, and any suitable employer. The Program sets specific goals, assigns responsibilities to each party, details rehabilitation service timelines, dates, and costs.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4553645 document outlines the Reasonable Accommodation Benefit on page 31, rows [3-24]. If an Insured Employee of the Employer is Disabled and receiving benefits, the Employer may be eligible for reimbursement of up to 50% of the cost for reasonable accommodation services, limited to $5,000 per employee or the Company's expected liability for the employee's Long Term Disability claim (whichever is less). Eligible services include making workspaces more accessible, removing barriers, providing specialized equipment, offering training materials in alternative formats, and other necessary accommodations to aid an Insured Employee's return to work with their employer.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, an employer is eligible for the Benefit if they have an insured employee whose disability prevents them from performing their regular occupation at the worksite but can do so with proposed accommodation. The employee must also possess the necessary physical and mental abilities for their own or another occupation at the worksite, contingent on accommodation. Furthermore, the employee should be reasonably expected to return to work with the help of the proposed accommodation. Lastly, the Company must find that the cost of the Reasonable Accommodation Benefit is less than the anticipated liability for the Insured Employee's Long Term Disability claim.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the written proposal for reasonable accommodation services should be collaboratively developed among the Employer, Insured Employee, and their Physician when needed. The proposal must clearly specify the purpose of the proposed accommodation, as well as the dates, times, and costs associated with these services. These details are essential in ensuring the proper implementation of the requested accommodations.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf pages 31 and 32, the Company, Employer, Insured Employee, or their Physician can propose an accommodation for the employee. The proposal must be approved in writing by the Company. Once approved, the Company will reimburse the Employer upon receipt of proof that they have provided services for the employee and paid the service provider. This process is subject to GL3002-CERT-15 99 guidelines.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, in case of a transfer of insurance carriers to prevent coverage loss for an Employee, the Policy offers Prior Insurance Credit. This credit is based on the employee's coverage under the previous carrier's policy on its termination date. The amount of credit is proportional to the time elapsed between the effective dates of both policies, up to a maximum of 100%. For instance, if the new and old policies have a three-month difference, the Employee would receive a 75% Prior Insurance Credit (3 months out of 4). This credit can significantly reduce the premiums for the new policy.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4553645 policy provides coverage for employees who were insured by the previous carrier upon transfer and were not actively-at-work due to injury or sickness on the policy's effective date. The coverage resembles that of the previous policy, if it had continued. The company pays the benefit amount that the prior carrier would have paid, minus any liability amount assumed by the prior carrier. This coverage is subject to premium payments and is found on Lincoln Cert 4553645 pages 32, rows 7-18.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf section (rows 21-44 on page 32) outlines disability benefits due to a pre-existing condition. If an employee was insured under the prior carrier's policy at the time of transfer and actively-at-work on the new policy's effective date, the following applies:

  1. The Policy's Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion will be applied, and benefits may be paid according to the Policy's benefit schedule if the Insured Employee qualifies.

  2. If the Insured Employee cannot satisfy the Policy's Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion but can demonstrate continuous insurance under both policies, benefits will be paid in accordance with the less restrictive of the two policies' benefit schedules, terms, conditions, and limitations.

  3. If the Insured Employee fails to meet either policy's Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion, no benefits will be awarded.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf section on row 3, 6, and 7 of page 33 outlines the Three Month Survivor Benefit. Upon your insured's death, if they were less than age 60 at policy inception, the beneficiary will receive 100% of the monthly benefit for three months following the death. The monthly benefit is calculated as GL3002-CERT-16 multiplied by 0.42. This benefit ceases after the three-month period or upon remarriage of the beneficiary, whichever occurs first. The effective date for this coverage is April 1, 2011.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 33 and 34, the Family Income Benefit is a lump sum payment made to the Eligible Survivor upon proof of an Insured Employee's death. The death must occur after 180 consecutive days of Disability and while receiving a Monthly Benefit. The benefit equals three times the Last Monthly Benefit, which is the gross Monthly Benefit the Insured Employee received immediately prior to death. No reductions will apply for Other Income Benefits or earnings from Partial Disability Employment. An Eligible Survivor can be the Insured Employee's surviving spouse, or if none, the Insured Employee's children under 25 at the date of death. If multiple children are eligible, they will receive equal shares. If necessary, payments to children may be made to a designated representative on their behalf, with this payment being valid and effective against all claims. The GL3002-CERT-39-FC MN 33 04/01/11 document provides these details.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the insurance company will reimburse an insured employee's family care expenses under specific conditions. These include when the employee is receiving either a Partial Disability Monthly Benefit or a Total Disability Benefit under the policy. If the employee is terminally ill, has suffered cognitive impairment, or has experienced a loss of activities of daily living, they are eligible for this Family Care Expense Benefit. This benefit supplements all other policy benefits and is not reduced by Other Income Benefits.
<EOS>
Under Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the Insured Employee must submit monthly proof of Family Care Expenses for their Dependent. The proof should include the Dependent's name, age, reason (if age exceeds defined Dependent limit), care dates, total charges, payments, provider details such as name, address, phone number, and either Federal Employer Identification Number or Taxpayer Identification Number. If a dependent's age surpasses the defined Dependent maximum, a justification for their care is required.
<EOS>
According to the Family Care Expense Benefit outlined in Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 34, row 40, eligible dependents can receive up to $250 per month for unreimbursed care expenses. This benefit is available only if the expenses are not covered by other sources.
<EOS>
According to the Family Care Expense Benefit section of Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, this benefit will terminate on one of the following occasions: when the Insured Employee's Total or Partial Disability Benefits under the policy conclude; if an Insured Employee's Dependents no longer comply with the dependent definition in this provision; or after the Company has made 12 consecutive monthly payments for Family Care Expense Benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the term 'Child' encompasses the Insured Employee's biological child, legally adopted child, stepchild, foster child, or any child for whom the employee serves as legal guardian. Eligibility for coverage extends to these children under the policy's provisions. The specific row and page numbers can be found on page 34, row 54.
<EOS>
According to the Cognitive Impairment definition in Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf (pages 34-35), an Insured Employee or Dependent with a permanent loss or deterioration of cognitive capacity requires active assistance or verbal cues to avoid self-harm or harming others, due to the impairment. The diagnosis must be made by a Physician based on clinical evidence and standardized tests assessing memory, orientation, and reasoning. This condition may stem from moderate to severe head trauma, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, or other irreversible dementia (GL3002-CERT-39-FC MN 34 04/01/11).
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, a 'Dependent' is defined as the Insured Employee's legal spouse (if living with and incapable of independent living due to a mental or physical condition), children under 16, unmarried children 16 years or older who live with the employee and are also incapable of independent living due to such conditions, parents or parent-in-law living with and incapable of independent living, or a sibling living with and incapable of independent living. All dependents must be unable to live independently due to mental or physical conditions.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf on pages 35 and relevant row numbers 33-37, 'Family Care Expense' refers to costs incurred for the care of a Dependent by a licensed provider. Notably, this Dependent must not be a member of the Insured Employee's immediate family nor reside in their home. This expense coverage is applicable for non-family members requiring care, subject to the terms and conditions outlined within the policy document.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, the term "Incapable of Independent Living" applies to a Dependent who meets one or more criteria: being Terminally Ill, suffering from Cognitive Impairment, experiencing Loss of Activities of Daily Living, or having a disability that prevents self-sustaining employment (developmental, mental, or physical), while chiefly dependent on the Insured Employee for support and maintenance. Such a Dependent may qualify under this policy if they are unable to work due to their condition.
<EOS>
According to the "Loss of Activities of Daily Living" section in Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, an insured employee or dependent is considered eligible if they cannot perform at least two out of six essential daily activities without substantial assistance from another person. These activities include eating, bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring (moving from one place to another), and continence (managing bodily waste). The inability to perform these tasks safely and independently is grounds for coverage. This loss must affect the individual's ability to carry out these functions nearly completely.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, bathing is defined as washing oneself in a tub, shower, or via a sponge bath with or without equipment on row 61 of page 35. The policy covers bathing incidents under the personal accident section, providing coverage up to a specified limit for eligible accidents. Additionally, the policy excludes self-inflicted injuries and pre-existing conditions, as stated in the exclusions section. This coverage is subject to terms, conditions, and limitations outlined in the policy document.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4553645.pdf, under the 'Dressing' section on pages 35 and rows 63-64, artificial limbs or braces that are regularly worn are considered for coverage. These prosthetic devices should be put on, taken off, fastened, or unfastened as medically necessary. The policy does not specify any specific timeframe or percentage for these actions.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4553645 policy detail on Page 35, Row 66 concerns toileting activities, including getting to, from, and on/off the toilet, as well as related personal hygiene. The policy provides coverage for any loss or damage arising from inability to perform these tasks due to accidental bodily injury or sickness, up to a specified daily limit and lifetime maximum. Exclusions apply for pre-existing conditions and certain chronic illnesses, with specific provisions regarding waiver of elimination periods under certain circumstances.

According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, the policy becomes effective on a deferred date specified elsewhere in the document (row 11). Changes to coverage are detailed throughout this section (rows 12-14), while termination of the policy is governed by certain conditions (row 15). The policy also includes continuation provisions for continued coverage under specific circumstances (row 16). Additionally, a conversion right allowing the policyholder to convert the policy to another form of coverage upon termination is specified in the document (row 12).
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 8 and subsequent rows 18-25, the policy offers several benefits: Disability Benefit provides coverage for temporary or permanent disability due to illness or injury, with a maximum benefit of 60% of base salary. Mental Illness and Substance Abuse Benefits offer up to 36 sessions per year for treatment. The Family Care Credit Benefit allows employees to take up to 8 weeks of leave to care for family members, with partial wage replacement. Survivor Income Benefit provides a monthly payment to designated beneficiaries upon the policyholder's death. Workplace Modification Benefit offers financial assistance for necessary job modifications due to illness or injury. Infectious and Contagious Disease Benefit provides additional coverage during an outbreak, while the Progressive Illness Benefit offers continued benefits as a disease progresses. Ability Plus Benefit offers resources and support services for policyholders dealing with chronic health conditions. Critical dates, numbers, and percentages may apply to each benefit, and specific requirements should be reviewed within the policy document.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, page 8 row 27, the policy includes a Pre-Existing Condition Limitation. This means that for conditions existing within 90 days before the effective date of coverage, benefits may be limited or denied if treatment, consultation, or prescribed drugs are related to that condition during the first 12 months. However, some preventative care services may still be covered despite this limitation. Additionally, coverage is available after 12 months for conditions that were managed without treatment or consultation within the initial 12 months. This provision applies only to medical and hospital expenses under the Major Medical Insurance section of the policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, the long-term disability insurance provides coverage for a sustained injury, illness, or pregnancy-related disability that prevents you from performing your job duties. The policy offers income protection with benefits starting after a 90-day elimination period, lasting until age 67 or your return to work, whichever occurs first. The monthly benefit amount is 60% of your pre-disability earnings, up to a maximum of $15,000 per month, subject to policy maximums and any applicable offsets.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, page 9 row 2, you are not required to contribute towards the cost of coverage under this policy. The premiums will be entirely borne by the insurer for the duration of this agreement, with no specified contribution from your end. This exemption is in effect throughout the term of the insurance contract.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, coverage is extended to all full-time active employees who are U.S. citizens or legal residents, with the exception of physicians, executives, directors, temporary, leased, or seasonal workers. Full-time employment requires a minimum of 30 hours weekly, excluding on-call hours. The policy does not apply to territories and protectorates of the United States.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, the Eligibility Waiting Period for Coverage is a continuous 60-day period. However, if you were a Full-time Active Employee with the employer prior to this coverage, the waiting period will be reduced accordingly. This reduction in time is contingent on your previous employment status and duration.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, the maximum monthly benefit under this policy is determined by the least of three values: $5,000, the Benefit Percentage applicable to you multiplied by your Pre-disability Earnings on which premium has been paid, or the Benefit Percentage applicable to you multiplied by your Pre-disability Earnings. This benefit amount will be paid out during your period of disability.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, the Minimum Monthly Benefit is either $100 or 10% of the Maximum Monthly Benefit you're eligible for under The Policy, minus any Other Income Benefits. This calculation is detailed on pages [9] rows [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The benefit amount will be determined at the start of your claim and remain consistent throughout its duration, unless there are changes to your eligibility or benefits under The Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, benefits payable under the policy vary based on your age at the time of retirement. If you retire before reaching the Social Security Normal Retirement Age (SSNRA), benefits will be reduced and may continue for up to 48 months, or until age 63, whichever is greater. Once you reach SSNRA, you can receive benefits for 18 months minimum, with a reduction period of 18-42 months depending on your age at the time of retirement. The SSNRA is determined by your birth year as stated in the 1983 revision of the United States Social Security Act. For example, if you were born in 1955, your SSNRA is 66 and you would have a reduction period of 27 months. If you were born in 1954 or later, your SSNRA increases incrementally up to age 67, at which point the reduction period is 24 months. After that, the reduction period decreases gradually until it reaches 18 months for those born on or after 1960.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 63 and 64, the Normal Retirement Age is defined as follows: individuals born in 1937 or before can retire at age 65, while those born between 1938 and 1954 can retire at age 66. Individuals born after 1960 must wait until age 67 to retire, whereas those born between 1955 and 1959 have a staggered retirement age that ranges from 66 + 2 months to 66 + 10 months. For instance, those born in 1958 can retire at age 66 + 8 months, while individuals born in 1942 can retire at age 65 + 10 months. This age variation reflects a gradual increase in the Normal Retirement Age over time to accommodate longer lifespans and retirement savings needs.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, page 10 row 2, the Family Care Credit Benefit provides a financial aid of up to $50,000 for eligible expenses incurred due to a covered family member's qualifying event, such as a critical illness or injury. The benefit can be used for services like skilled nursing care, hospice care, respite care, and home health care. The policy covers a 12-month period from the date of the qualifying event and requires prior authorization for reimbursement. Additionally, this benefit is subject to a waiting period and a lifetime maximum of $500,000 per insured person.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, on page 10 row 2, the Survivor Income Benefit section outlines that upon the Policyholder's death, a beneficiary may receive a percentage of the base policy amount annually for a specified period. The minimum benefit payable is 5% per annum, and the maximum is 40%, depending on the election made by the Policyholder. This benefit ceases when the chosen payment period ends, or if all payments have been made. The beneficiary's age at the time of the Policyholder's death determines the duration of the payment period. For instance, if the beneficiary is under 65 years old, the payment period lasts for their lifetime; if they are over 65, the benefit may be paid for a specific number of years determined by their age, up to age 90. This feature requires that the Policyholder must have been living when the election was made and must not have reached age 85 at the time of such election.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, under Workplace Modification Benefit (row 2, page 10), if you sustain an injury at work that requires modification to your workplace for temporary or permanent purposes, the policy will provide coverage for necessary modifications. These changes may include but are not limited to wheelchair ramps, handrails, or accessibility improvements. The cost of these modifications is subject to a $500 deductible per occurrence and is paid at 100% up to a maximum limit of $25,000 for temporary changes and $50,000 for permanent alterations, following the initial injury period. Modifications made before filing a claim will not be covered. The Workplace Modification Benefit coverage is in addition to other benefits specified in the policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, page 10 row 2, an Infectious and Contagious Disease Benefit is included in the policy. This benefit offers coverage up to $50,000 for qualified expenses due to a diagnosed infectious or contagious disease. The benefit period lasts for 6 months from the date of diagnosis. Qualifying events include hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) confinement, emergency room visits, and outpatient treatments. Diagnosed diseases must be identified in the CDC's list of reportable diseases or by a medical professional as causing hospitalization, ICU confinement, or death. The benefit is subject to a 30-day waiting period from the policy effective date before coverage begins. A deductible applies, and the payable amount is 80% of the eligible expense up to the maximum benefit limit.
<EOS>
According to the Progressive Illness Benefit outlined in Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, page 10 row 2, this policy provides coverage for specified diseases that qualify as chronic or progressive illnesses. If you are diagnosed with such an illness and meet the requirements, benefits may be paid in a lump sum or periodically. The benefit amount is a percentage of your base salary, up to a maximum of $10,000 per month, and will continue until the end of your policy term or your death, whichever comes first. A waiting period of 90 days applies before benefits can be claimed. Additionally, the policy offers an optional rider for cancer-related illnesses with no waiting period, providing a lump sum benefit upon diagnosis.
<EOS>
According to the Ability Plus Benefit on Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (page 10, row 2), if an insured individual suffers a qualifying disability before age 67 and remains continuously disabled for at least 90 days, a monthly benefit of up to $4,000 will be provided to aid in maintaining independence and quality of life. The benefit is paid after the elimination period of 365 days has passed. Notably, this rider provides coverage for a total of seven years or until age 67, whichever comes first. Additionally, if an insured individual dies while receiving the Ability Plus Benefit, any remaining benefits will be distributed to their named beneficiary.
<EOS>
According to the Eligible Persons section on Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (page 44, row 2), all persons belonging to the classes outlined in the Schedule of Insurance are eligible for coverage. The Schedule provides a list specifying who qualifies for this policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, eligibility for coverage is contingent upon either the Participating Employer Effective Date or the completion of the Eligibility Waiting Period for Coverage as shown in the Schedule of Insurance, whichever is later. This waiting period varies based on the specific insurance schedule provided. Once these conditions are met, coverage commences immediately thereafter.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, all eligible Active Employees are enrolled automatically by the employer without any specific action needed on their part. This enrollment occurs upon employment activation or during open enrollment periods as defined in the policy. It is essential to note that once enrolled, employees can modify their coverage options during the annual open enrollment period or during qualifying life events. Additionally, the policy provides a summary plan description (SPD) which outlines the specific details of the coverage offered and employee responsibilities under this insurance program.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, effective dates for coverage differ based on the type and your enrollment timeline. Non-contributory coverage begins when you become eligible, but if you enroll within 31 days of eligibility, it starts on that date. Contributory coverage without Evidence of Insurability requirement also follows this rule. For any coverage requiring such evidence, it becomes effective upon our approval, which may be later. All dates are subject to the Deferred Effective Date provision.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, your insurance or increase in coverage will only take effect after you return to active work if you are absent due to accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse, or pregnancy on the date your coverage would otherwise start. This deferred effective date applies when your absence occurs before your policy starts.
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, changes to coverage amounts may occur due to alterations in the policyholder's job class or pre-disability earnings. The effective date for an increase in coverage is contingent on the policyholder being an active employee and not absent due to disability at that time. Upon absence, the effective date will be deferred until the policyholder returns to work for a full day. A notification of any change in pre-disability earnings will only take effect from the date it's received. Changes in the policy itself will become effective on the date of the alteration, subject to the Deferred Effective Date provision and Pre-existing Conditions Limitation. Any increase or decrease resulting from a policy change may be deferred if the policyholder is absent due to disability at that time.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, your coverage will terminate on the earliest of seven occasions: (1) when the policy terminates, (2) if it no longer covers your specified class, (3) if a premium payment is due but not paid, (4) at the end of the period for which premium contributions are required, (5) upon cessation of employment or ceasing to be a full-time active employee in an eligible class, or (6) when your employer terminates participation. However, continued coverage may occur under specific continuation provisions unless otherwise stated.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages [11, 12] details continuation provisions of insurance coverage. Coverage can be extended beyond the termination date if your employer provides a uniform plan for all employees. Continued coverage is subject to policy reductions, employer premium payments, and termination upon policy termination, employer ceasing to be a participating employer, or class termination. The benefit level remains the same as pre-continuation day.

In specific situations such as family military leave or medical leave, coverage may be extended for up to 30 days in case of military service outside specified areas (1250 hours eligible) or up to 12 weeks (or 26 weeks with military leave) under the Family and Medical Leave Act. Coverage ceases immediately if the leave ends prematurely. Notification is required at least 14 days before a leave of more than five consecutive workdays, and as soon as reasonable for shorter leaves.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, if you become disabled and cease to be an active employee, your insurance coverage will continue under the following conditions:

1. During the Elimination Period, as long as you remain disabled by the same disability.
2. Beyond the Elimination Period, your coverage will persist for as long as you are entitled to benefits under The Policy.

It's essential to note that the Elimination Period length and the duration of benefits eligibility may vary based on specific policy terms.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, no premium payments are required after the Elimination Period has elapsed, and this waiver continues as long as benefits are being paid out. This means that if you become disabled, you won't need to make premium payments following the specified waiting period. The exact length of the Elimination Period is not detailed in this section; however, it should be noted that the number of premium-free days varies based on the specific policy details.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, if you become disabled and the Participating Employer's coverage terminates, your benefits will continue as long as your disability persists from the same incident. However, these benefits will not extend beyond the date we would have stopped paying benefits had the insurance remained active. The termination of the Participating Employer's coverage for any reason will not affect our liability under this provision. In essence, your benefits will be paid according to the terms of the policy, even if the employer's coverage ends.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (pages 12-13), if your insurance terminates due to reasons other than retirement or ineligibility, you may be eligible for the group long term disability conversion policy under specific conditions:

1. Continuous coverage of at least 12 months.
2. Ability to perform duties of your occupation.
3. The Policy has not terminated.
4. No similar benefits from another group policy.

To enroll, you must submit a written request and pay the required premium within 31 days of insurance termination. Upon meeting these conditions, a certificate of insurance under the conversion policy will be issued effective from the day after your original policy's termination. The coverage available under this policy may vary, with terms determined based on the group long term disability conversion Policy at the time of enrollment.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 13, rows 2-12, this policy provides Disability Benefits if you become disabled while insured and meet specific conditions:

1. You must be disabled throughout the Elimination Period (defined elsewhere in the document).
2. Your disability must continue beyond the Elimination Period.
3. Proof of Loss submission is required to receive benefits.
4. Benefits begin on the first day after the Elimination Period and are paid monthly, but they will not exceed the Maximum Duration of Benefits.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on page 13 (rows 2-1, 2-3, 4-9, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7), if a disability arises from mental illness due to any cause, from related conditions, alcoholism under treatment, or substance abuse (narcotics, sedatives, stimulants, hallucinogens, etc.), the maximum duration of benefits will be limited. Benefits will be payable either for as long as you are confined in a medical care facility or for up to 24 months if not confined, with this total duration applying to all such disabilities throughout your lifetime.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, if you experience a recovery during the elimination period but subsequently become disabled again within 180 days due to the same or related cause, the initial and recurrent disability will be considered as one period, provided the policy remains active. However, if you remain non-disabled for 180 days or more, any subsequent disability is treated as a new disability subject to a fresh elimination period and maximum duration of benefits, along with the policy terms in effect at that time. Days spent in recovery will not count toward the elimination period, but only if the number of days you work during this period is less than half the length of your elimination period.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, when you recover or return to work after a disability, premium payments continue for you, as defined in section [2], row [2] on page 13. This implies that you are no longer considered disabled per the policy terms. The recovery or recovery period does not absolve you from paying premiums for yourself during this time. It is essential to understand that your return to work, while receiving continued premium payments, may affect any ongoing disability benefits under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, if you become disabled and earn 20% or less of your indexed pre-disability earnings after the elimination period, your disability benefit will be calculated as follows: First, multiply your pre-disability earnings by the specified benefit percentage. Second, compare the product with the maximum benefit; the lesser amount is then deducted from any other income benefits, resulting in your monthly disability benefit.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf policy section outlines disability benefit calculations under the Return to Work Incentive (Page numbers [13, 14], rows [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]). If you're disabled after the Elimination Period and earn more than 20% of your Indexed Pre-disability Earnings for up to 12 consecutive months, your monthly benefit is calculated as follows:

  1. Multiply your Pre-disability Earnings by the Benefit Percentage.
  2. Compare the result with the Maximum Benefit; deduct Other Income Benefits from the lesser amount to get your Monthly Benefit. Your Current Monthly Earnings are not considered in this calculation, but if the sum of your Monthly Benefit and Current Monthly Earnings exceeds 100% of your Pre-disability Earnings, your Monthly Benefit will be reduced by the excess amount.

  3. The 12 consecutive month period starts on the last day you start work earning more than 20% of your Indexed Pre-disability Earnings or the end of the Elimination Period. If you're disabled, not receiving benefits under the Return to Work Incentive, and earn more than 20% of your Indexed Pre-disability Earnings, your Monthly Benefit will be calculated as the greater of the Proportionate Loss Formula or the 50% Offset Formula.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, specifically on page 14 row 5, elucidates the Indexed Pre-disability Earnings provision. If you become disabled, and your earnings are less than 20% of your pre-disability income, a monthly benefit will be payable. The benefit amount is indexed to keep pace with inflation, ensuring its value over time. The calculation of this benefit is based on your pre-disability earnings, as stipulated in the policy. It's essential to note that the exact amount can vary depending on your individual circumstances and the specific terms of your policy.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (page 14, rows 1-5, 1-2), it is detailed that if the sum of your monthly benefit, current earnings, and other income benefits surpasses 100% of your pre-disability earnings, a reduction in your monthly benefit will occur, proportionate to the excess amount. However, your monthly benefit will never fall below the minimum monthly benefit. In case an overpayment happens, recovery measures may be taken according to the Overpayment Recovery provision.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, located on page 14 row 2, your Monthly Benefit under this policy will never fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit specified in the Schedule of Insurance. The schedule detailing this benefit is an essential part of your coverage and forms a crucial aspect of this insurance contract.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, if a Monthly Benefit is payable for a period shorter than a month, the benefit calculation will be 1/30 of the Monthly Benefit for each day of disability. Therefore, if you are disabled for 10 days in an incomplete month, your benefit would be (10/30) * Monthly Benefit. This payment method applies only to situations where benefits are due for less than a full month.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, your benefit payments will cease on the earliest of:

1. The date you no longer meet the disability criteria.
2. If you fail to provide Proof of Loss.
3. The date you are no longer under a Physician's regular care.
4. If you refuse an examination requested by the insurance company.
5. Your death.
6. The last day benefits are payable according to the Maximum Duration of Benefits Table.
7. When your Current Monthly Earnings exceed either 80% of your Indexed Pre-disability Earnings if disabled from your Occupation, or 60% if disabled from any Occupation.
8. The date no further benefits are payable under any provision in the policy that limits benefit duration.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf outlines the Family Care Credit Benefit. If you're in a Rehabilitation program and providing care for children under 13 or disabled household members, we'll deduct these costs from your rehab earnings. The monthly deduction per qualifying child/member is $350 (first 12 months) or $175 (thereafter), up to a total of $2,500 annually. Deductions are proportional for periods less than a month. Documentation from the caregiver is required. This deduction ends when you're no longer in Rehabilitation or after 24 months of Family Care Credits during your Disability. No family-related care will be eligible as a deduction. Your current monthly earnings, adjusted for Family Care Credits, determine your monthly benefit. You won't receive a benefit if your current earnings before the deduction exceed 80% of your pre-disability earnings.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (page 15, rows 2-8, 1-1), if you die while receiving Monthly Disability Benefits, your survivors will be eligible for a Survivor Income Benefit. Proof of death and entitlement is required within one year of your passing. The benefit can go to your surviving spouse, children (in equal shares if no spouse), or your estate if there are no surviving relatives. However, any overpayment on your claim will be deducted first. The Survivor Income Benefit equals 3 times your Maximum Monthly Benefit.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 15, rows 2-10, a Surviving Spouse is defined as the legally married spouse at the time of the policyholder's death. Domestic partners or parties in civil unions are also included under certain conditions: either by executing a satisfactory domestic partner affidavit or registering as domestic partners with a government agency where such registration is available, and providing proof unless it's prohibited by law. The policyholder must meet these requirements to be considered a domestic partner or party to a civil union. Continued compliance with the requirements outlined in the affidavit or legally mandated ensures this status.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 15 and 16, rows [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 1, 2], Surviving Children are defined as your unmarried, underage children, stepchildren, or legally adopted children who were primarily dependent on you for support and maintenance. This group also includes children related to you by blood or marriage or domestic partnership who lived with you in a regular parent-child relationship and were eligible to be claimed as dependents on your federal income tax return prior to your death. Children between ages 21 and 25 are included if they are in full-time attendance at an institution of learning. If a minor child is entitled to benefits, the insurance company may make benefit payments to their caregiver until a legal guardian is appointed.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, a Workplace Modification Benefit is offered for accommodating an employee's return to work following a disability covered by the policy. This benefit necessitates the employer's agreement to modify the workplace and our approval of any proposed modifications. We may evaluate the appropriateness of these modifications through examinations or evaluations by selected physicians, health care professionals, vocational experts, or rehabilitation specialists.

Benefits will be paid up to the amount equal to item number 1 of the Maximum Monthly Benefit. The employer's costs for approved modifications will be reimbursed after completion of the proposed modifications, provision of written proof of expenses, and your return as an Active Employee. This benefit is subject to our right to examine or evaluate the employee at our expense.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 16, rows 2 and 3, Workplace Modification refers to alterations made to your work environment or job responsibilities to accommodate you while disabled. This change will not impact any benefits you are entitled to under the policy. The payment of this benefit does not reduce or deny other policy-eligible benefits.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (pages 16-17) details the Infectious and Contagious Disease Benefit. To qualify, you must: carry a disease categorized as infectious and contagious by the Center for Disease Control; test positive after the benefit's effective date; not be Disabled but have your license revoked, restricted, or lose patients due to disclosure; suffer a 20%+ loss of earnings during the Elimination Period. The monthly benefit is calculated: (Pre-disability Earnings - Current Monthly Earnings) x Maximum Benefit under the Policy. Payment ends upon death, Disability eligibility, lack of full-time work effort, failure to seek alternate work, or Maximum Duration of Benefits. Additionally, a Progressive Illness Benefit is available if diagnosed with a Progressive Illness and a Physician provides satisfactory proof after coverage under the Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, a Progressive Illness is defined as a non-infectious, indefinite duration disease or disorder that progressively disables the afflicted person by impacting their ability to perform their own occupation. If you become disabled due to such an illness, your pre-disability earnings will be the greater of either your earnings at the time you provide proof from a physician of your progressive illness or your earnings at the time of disability under this policy. Any disability benefits resulting from a Progressive Illness are calculated using these determined pre-disability earnings and adhering to all other policy terms effective on the date of disability. Until disability occurs, premiums are based on either the greater of your pre-disability earnings under this benefit or your pre-disability earnings according to the policy terms. Your premium will not drop below the amount paid at the time proof of progressive illness is submitted unless you qualify for Waiver of Premium under this policy.
<EOS>
The Ability Plus Benefit in Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf is a monthly payment equal to 10% of your pre-disability earnings (not exceeding $5,000 or the Maximum Monthly Benefit). You qualify if you become cognitively impaired or unable to perform two or more Activities of Daily Living for at least 30 consecutive days due to a disability that begins while covered under this benefit. This payment continues until your monthly benefit terminates, you're no longer cognitively impaired and can perform five or more ADLs, or the covered loss period ends (for periods less than one month, payments are 1/30th of the Ability Plus Benefit per day). The Ability Plus Benefit is not affected by Other Income Benefits or other benefits under the policy. You have complete freedom in using this benefit, and it will not limit your actions.
<EOS>
According to the terms outlined in the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 17 and 18, a cognitively impaired individual is defined as one who experiences severe deterioration or loss of memory, orientation, or the ability to understand or reason significantly enough to impede daily tasks such as medication management, financial management, and telephone usage. This intellectual capacity decline must be measurable via standardized tests. The specified cognitive impairment must hinder an individual's ability to perform common duties.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on page 18 rows [2-24], the Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) are defined as self-bathing (either using a tub or shower devices or giving oneself a sponge bath), dressing oneself, utilizing the toilet, transferring from bed to chair or wheelchair, maintaining bladder and bowel control (voluntary function or keeping up reasonable personal hygiene when unable), and feeding oneself once prepared food is made available. These functions can be performed with or without equipment or adaptive devices. The ability to perform these ADLs may impact the policy coverage.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, the policy does not provide coverage or pay benefits for any disability that: a) is not under regular medical care; b) results from war or acts of war (declared or undeclared); c) arises from committing or attempting to commit a felony; d) is related to an illegal occupation, e) is self-inflicted intentionally; or f) if you were receiving or eligible for benefits under a prior disability plan sponsored by your employer that terminated before this policy's effective date.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, benefits for disabilities resulting from or caused/contributed to by pre-existing conditions are not covered unless one of two criteria is met: either the policyholder has not received medical care for the condition during the past three consecutive months while insured under the policy, or they have been continuously insured under the policy for a period of twelve consecutive months.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (page 18, rows 2-11), a pre-existing condition is defined as any accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, pregnancy, or episode of substance abuse for which medical care was received within the three months prior to either the start date of coverage or a change in coverage. This definition also includes any manifestations, symptoms, findings, or aggravations related to these conditions. It is essential to note that this applies to situations occurring during this specified period.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 18, rows 2-5, medical care services are eligible for coverage under the following conditions: a healthcare provider is consulted or offers advice, or recommends, prescribes, or provides treatment. These services must be medically necessary and essential to the diagnosis or treatment of an injury or sickness covered by the policy. The insured party is responsible for paying any copayments, coinsurance, or deductibles as specified in the policy, with a maximum annual out-of-pocket limit of $2,000. Services must be rendered by a licensed provider within the policy's network unless prior authorization is obtained for out-of-network care. All services must be pre-authorized when required by the policy and received within one year from the accident or onset date.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 18 and 19 under rows 2, 3, 4, 5, and 1, the treatment section encompasses medical examinations, tests, attendance, or observation, as well as the utilization of drugs, medicines, medical services, supplies, or equipment. This includes necessary medications and medical procedures, including diagnostic tests, follow-up care, and any required medical devices or apparatuses. These treatments may be incurred both at the hospital and outpatient settings. The policy does not specify a percentage coverage but provides coverage subject to the policy's terms and conditions.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (page 59, rows 2-6, 1, 2), you or the beneficiary must notify the company in writing within 30 days of either the date of death or the loss. Delayed notice should be given as soon as practical. The written communication should include your name, address, and the Participating Employer Account Number. Failure to meet these timelines may affect your claim.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, within 15 days of receiving a Notice of Claim, the insurance company will provide Proof of Loss forms. If these forms are not sent within that timeframe, the claimant can submit any written evidence that fully describes the nature and extent of their claim instead. This deadline applies to rows [1, 1, 2, 3] on page number 60.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (page 19) outlines the Proof of Loss requirements for disability insurance claims. Essential evidence includes:

   - Date and cause of your disability
   - Pre-disability earnings and current monthly income, demonstrated by tax returns
   - Medical information such as x-rays, photocopied records, and consulted professionals/facilities/pharmacies over the past three years
   - Authorization for release of medical, employment, and financial information
   - Identification of other income benefits
   - Proof that you have applied for available other income benefits

Submitted proof must be acceptable to the insurance company. You will not need to claim any retirement benefits that are only accessible on a reduced basis.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, the policyholder is required to submit to interviews, examinations by physicians, vocational experts, functional experts, or other professionals chosen by the company. These assessments will occur at the company's expense and as deemed necessary by them. The policyholder's proof of loss must be acceptable to the company. Refusal to comply with these requests without a valid reason may result in the denial, suspension, or termination of benefits.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, written Proof of Loss must be submitted within 90 days after the commencement of the liability period. If proof cannot be provided within this timeframe due to unavoidable circumstances or if it is provided as soon as possible but no later than one year from its due date (except when the policyholder is not legally competent), the claim will not be affected. The insurance company may also request Proof of Loss throughout the Disability period, and proof must be delivered within 30 days of such a request.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, if you meet the criteria of being disabled and eligible for benefits, payments will be issued at the end of each month while you are disabled. Optionally, advance benefit payments based on the estimated duration of your disability may also be made. Payments due after a claim termination will be paid upon receiving satisfactory Proof of Loss.
<EOS>
According to the specified section of Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, all payments for a claim will be made directly to the policyholder (You). In the event of the policyholder's death, any outstanding payments may be distributed to the estate. If a payment is due to the policyholder's estate, a minor, or an individual who is not legally competent, The Hartford may pay up to $1,000 to a relative who is entitled to it at their discretion. This payment shall fulfill their obligation for the amount paid.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, if your claim for benefits is wholly or partly denied, you will receive a written notification detailing the specific reasons for the denial and referencing the relevant policy provisions. The notification will also describe any additional information necessary to perfect the claim and explain why it's required, as well as provide an explanation of the review procedure. This process ensures transparency and allows for potential rectification or further investigation.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on page 20, you or your representative can appeal a claim denial for a full and fair review within specific timeframes. For claims involving disability determination, an application must be submitted in writing within 180 days of receiving the denial notice. If no disability determination is required, the deadline is 60 days from the denial date. You may also request relevant documents, records, and information related to your claim and submit written comments or additional evidence. The Hartford will provide a written response with their final decision on the claim.
<EOS>
According to the Arbitration section on Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (page 20, rows [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2]), if you disagree with The Company's decision regarding your Disability Benefits claim after their final review, you can refer the dispute to an arbitrator. To initiate arbitration, contact the main office of the American Arbitration Association in Washington, D.C. Proceedings will adhere to the established procedures for Employee Benefit Plan Claims by the American Arbitration Association. A single, neutral arbitrator selected from their approved panel for employee benefit disputes will conduct the proceedings. Each party will bear half of the arbitration costs unless otherwise directed by the arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding, and judgement can be entered in any court with jurisdiction.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (page 20-21, rows 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4), you must apply for Social Security disability benefits when your disability exceeds the minimum duration requirement. Application should be made within 45 days of our request. If your eligibility is denied by the Social Security Administration, you are required to follow their reconsideration process and, if necessary, request a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge at the Office of Hearing and Appeals.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on page 21, rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4], the company reserves the right to reduce disability benefits under the U.S. Social Security Act based on potential eligibility of claimants and their dependents. If estimated, these reductions will be applied to your monthly benefit. Exceptions occur if you apply for and pursue all required appeals (per Social Security provision), sign a form authorizing SSA information release, return the reimbursement agreement, and agree to repay any overpayments.

In case of actual awards, the company will adjust your monthly benefit upon receiving proof and determine if it was higher or lower than the estimate. If denied, an adjustment is made when you provide proof of final denial from the Office of Hearing and Appeals. If estimated benefits were found to be lower, a refund is issued as a lump sum. Conversely, if overpaid due to underestimation, you must make a lump sum refund equal to all overpayments, according to the Overpayment Recovery provision.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, an overpayment in this policy arises when the total benefits paid exceed what's due to you (Page 21, rows 2-11) or when payments are made under another group policy (row 1). This can happen due to retroactive awards from specified sources, failure to report Other Income Benefits or earnings, misstatements, fraud, errors, or any other payment discrepancy (rows 2-7). Overpayments may result from overstated benefits or incorrect reporting of other income sources.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (pages 21-22, rows 2-20), the insurance company has the right to recover any overpayment determined within 30 days from you or your estate, other organizations, insurance companies, or anyone to whom payment was made. Overpayments can be recovered through court, collection agency referral, reducing future benefits, and legal pursuit. If reimbursement isn't made on time, the company may offset against your future benefits until full reimbursement is achieved, allowing payments to continue once overpaid amounts are recovered. Critical notes: any reimbursement agreement you sign when eligible for benefits under The Policy may further specify terms; failure to make timely reimbursement grants the company legal and equitable rights in court.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 22, rows 2-10, if you sustain a disability due to another party's action or inaction, receive compensation for lost wages from the policy, and fail to initiate legal action against the third party within a reasonable timeframe, the insurer will have the right to subrogate any claims you may have against that third party. They may opt to take legal action themselves to recover payments made in relation to your disability. This provision is effective as per the terms of the policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 22 rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], the insurance company reserves the right to seek reimbursement for any disability benefit payments made or required, should you receive compensation from a third party. This compensation can be obtained through legal judgments, arbitration awards, settlements, or other means. In such cases, you are obligated to repay the company the lesser amount between: a) the payment made or required by the company; or b) the recovered amount from the third party less any associated reasonable legal fees.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, on page 22, row 2, "Third Party" refers to any individual or legal entity whose actions or negligence in whole or in part result in the policyholder experiencing a Disability and triggering benefits payable under The Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 22, rows 2-6, legal action against us can only be initiated after a 60-day period following the provision of Proof of Loss or within 3 years from when it is required according to The Policy's terms. This timeframe prevents premature and untimely legal actions.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, Insurance Fraud involves providing false or incomplete information for benefits claims with intent to deceive the company. This action is considered a crime. The company employs various means to detect, investigate, deter, and prosecute such fraudulent activities. Legal remedies will be pursued if perpetrated by you or your employer.
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, material misstatements about the policyholder may lead to a premium adjustment and reevaluation of coverage duration. For three years following the policy's inception, any statements related to insurability made by the policyholder, that aren't fraudulent, will not be used against the insurance claim. To be valid, such statements must be in writing, signed by the policyholder, and remain effective only if provided within the specified rows on page 22 of the document. After this three-year period, these statements can no longer be used to contest the related insurance coverage.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, an employee is considered 'Actively at Work' if they are on a scheduled workday, performing their regular duties of their occupation in the usual manner and for their usual number of hours. If a day is not a scheduled workday, the employee must have been actively working on the preceding scheduled workday for this status to apply. This definition only pertains to days that the employer designates as workdays.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, an Active Employee refers to a worker who consistently carries out duties for the Employer within the normal scope of business. Their employment must meet the minimum hours stated in the Insurance Schedule. This policy applies only to employees working these specified hours or more.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, any occupation for which you are qualified by education, training or experience is considered under the 'Any Occupation' definition (page 23, row 2). To qualify for benefits, your post-disability earnings must not exceed 60% of your indexed pre-disability earnings.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, the term 'Bonuses' refers to the monthly average of monetary bonuses you received from three possible sources:

1) Your Employer during the 1-year period prior to your Disability onset if you were Actively at Work before becoming disabled; or
2) Your Employer over the entire duration of employment, should it be less than the aforementioned year; or
3) Any employer or work performed during your Period of Disability. This information can be found in rows 2 to 8 on page 23.
<EOS>
According to the commissions section of Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, the monthly average of monetary commissions can be calculated from the following sources:

1) The employer during the one-year period before your disability onset if you were actively employed at that time; or
2) The employer for the entire duration you worked there, should that period be less than a year; or
3) Any employer or work performed during your disability period.

These commissions include any received prior to becoming disabled and throughout your disability period.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, Current Monthly Earnings refers to income you receive from employment, other jobs, and any work for pay or profit during your Disabled state. Bonuses and commissions are included in this calculation, adjusted proportionally as needed. This figure takes into account various sources of income to determine your total earnings, all of which are relevant when assessing your disability benefits.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, Disability is defined as being unable to perform one or more essential duties of your occupation during the elimination period, with subsequent earnings less than 80% of your indexed pre-disability earnings for the following 24 months. After that, any occupation applies. If your current monthly earnings are 80% or more of your pre-disability earnings at the end of the elimination period, the disability will extend for another 12 months or until earnings fall below 80%. Causes include accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse, or pregnancy. Loss of a license to perform duties does not necessarily mean disability, and suspension, revocation, restriction, or surrender of a professional or occupational license do not constitute disability alone. Disability is determined by inability to perform essential duties, not just licensure status.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, an Essential Duty is a substantial, non-incidental task that is fundamental or inherent to the occupation and cannot be reasonably omitted or changed. Specifically, working the number of hours in your regularly scheduled work week is considered an Essential Duty. This definition emphasizes the significance of these duties within the context of one's occupation.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 23, rows 2-4, the term 'Indexed Pre-disability Earnings' refers to your pre-disability income, adjusted annually by 5%. This adjustment will commence on the first day of the month following 12 months of benefit receipt. After this initial increase, further yearly increases will be applied, compounding at an additional 5% each anniversary of the initial adjustment's date. These adjustments will take effect from the first day of the subsequent month.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, on page 24 row 1, a monthly benefit is defined as a regular sum paid to the policyholder while they are disabled, subject to the policy's terms. This benefit serves as financial support during periods of incapacity. The specific amount and duration of payment will depend on the individual policy details and the criteria for disability eligibility outlined within the policy itself.
<EOS>
This text appears to be a section from an insurance policy that outlines the definition and exclusions of "Other Income Benefits." Here's a simplified breakdown:

- Other Income Benefits are any payments received that represent or compensate for loss of earnings, such as workers' compensation, lawsuit settlements, or retirement benefits.
- However, certain types of income are explicitly excluded from being considered Other Income Benefits, such as early retirement benefits under the United States Social Security Act, personal investment income, military retirement benefits, defined contribution plans, employee stock option plans, and individual insurance benefits.
- If Other Income Benefits are received in a lump sum or settlement, proof of the amount attributed to loss of income and the period covered by the payment is required.
- Any increase in Other Income Benefits that takes effect after the date benefits become payable under the policy will not be included as Other Income Benefits.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, a Participating Employer refers to an Employer who agrees to partake in the Trust and meets the conditions outlined in The Policy. These employers must contribute as required, maintaining their status as active employees within the policy's framework.

The calculations consider either 1) your total earnings from the full tax year before you were last actively employed before disability, or 2) the number of months you worked for the employer if less than a year, including contributions made to retirement plans like IRC Sections 401(k), 403(b), or 457 deferred compensation arrangements, executive non-qualified deferred compensation arrangements, and IRC Section 125 plan salary reductions for the same period. These earnings are determined using tax records such as a Form W-2.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, regular care of a physician refers to treatment by a medical professional with appropriate training and experience for your disabling condition. The treatment must adhere to the guidelines set by medical, research, and rehabilitative organizations, be consistent with the diagnosis, and administered as frequently needed to achieve maximum medical improvement. This care should be ongoing until recovery is reached or stabilization occurs.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, Rehabilitation involves collaborating with the policyholder to plan, adapt, and implement options aimed at facilitating their return to work. This process may incorporate various necessary and feasible services such as vocational testing, vocational training, alternative treatments like support groups, physical therapy, occupational therapy, or speech therapy. Additionally, it can encompass workplace modifications, job placement, transitional work, and similar services when deemed appropriate.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 25 and 26, row numbers 2 and 1, a policyholder's spouse, adult roommate, sibling, parent, step-parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew, as well as someone in a similar legal relationship, such as a son, daughter, or grandchild, are considered related individuals for insurance purposes. These individuals may have certain rights or obligations under the policy. The specific terms and conditions can vary based on the individual's relationship to the policyholder, so it is essential to review the entire policy for details.
<EOS>

According to the substance abuse section of Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, a pattern of pathological substance use, encompassing alcohol and other psychoactive drugs but excluding tobacco and caffeine, is characterized by debilitating physical conditions, impairments in social or occupational functioning, an inability to abstain or reduce consumption, or the need for daily substance use to maintain adequate functioning. This definition emphasizes a state of addiction, as indicated by four key factors: physical dependency, functional impairment, inability to quit, and dependence on continued usage for normal function.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 26, rows 2-4, your occupation refers to the role you regularly perform in the general workforce, not a specific job at a particular employer or location. For Physicians, your occupation is defined as either the general specialty category or a recognized sub-specialty by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS). If your sub-specialty isn't listed with ABMS, it falls under the general specialty category. This definition applies prior to disability.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, the individual to whom this insurance certificate is issued is referred to as 'You or Your.' This definition appears on page 65, row 1.

The Surviving Spouse definition in the Survivor Income Benefit is amended to include partners registered in a civil union. Continued adherence to legal requirements ensures ongoing consideration as parties to a civil union.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, a "Spouse" may include one's domestic partner as defined by the policy or local law. To qualify, you must either:

1) Submit a satisfactory domestic partner affidavit, demonstrating your partnership for this policy, or
2) Register as domestic partners with a government agency where possible and provide proof of registration (unless law prohibits it).

Continuation as a domestic partner hinges on meeting the requirements outlined in the affidavit or mandated by law. For Wisconsin residents, appeal claim time periods are removed in all other respects, the Policy and certificates remain unchanged.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, a Change in Family Status pertains to specific events including marriage/civil union, divorce, birth/adoption of a child, death of spouse or child, change in employment status affecting group insurance, or alteration from part-time to full-time or vice versa.

The Policy Interpretation provision has been deleted and replaced with an ERISA claim fiduciary designation for the company, granting discretionary authority to decide eligibility for benefits and interpret policy terms. This decision will be made in the interest of plan participants, and judicial review is possible after exhausting administrative remedies. The time periods for claim appeals have been altered to 180 days if they are less than 180 days. Arbitration has been removed as an option. For New Jersey residents, the Change in Family Status provision has been updated. If a recurring disability occurs within 6 months, it is considered the same Period of Disability. The assignment of discretionary authority may affect court review standards, requiring plan participants or beneficiaries to prove arbitrary and capricious or abusive decisions to prevail.
<EOS>
In accordance with the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, a surviving spouse refers to your legally married partner or your domestic partner if certain conditions are met. To be recognized as a domestic partner for this policy:

1) You must have executed a domestic partner affidavit that satisfies the insurer and confirms you and your partner as domestic partners under the insurance policy.
2) Alternatively, registration as domestic partners with an applicable government agency is acceptable where such registration exists.

Continued recognition as domestic partners requires ongoing compliance with legal requirements or those stated in the domestic partner affidavit. The Change in Family Status provision has been superseded by these conditions.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, a Change in Family Status encompasses various events such as marriage or domestic partnership registration, divorce or termination of partnership, birth or adoption of a child, spouse/domestic partner's death, emancipation or death of a child, loss of group insurance due to job termination by your spouse/partner, or alterations in employment status from full-time to part-time.

For both states, benefit eligibility, payment, and plan interpretation decisions rest with the plan administrator. Judicial review is permitted in federal court, but this discretion does not restrict such claims. The level of discretion accorded to the insurance company will be determined by a federal court. In Vermont, this provision replaces the previous Policy Interpretation.

According to The Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, Vermont law mandates that health insurers offer equivalent coverage to parties in a civil union as provided to married persons. This equivalent coverage requirement is enforced on [33], row [2]. The legislation aims to ensure parity between the benefits afforded to married individuals and those in a civil union.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, definitions of terms like "marriage", "spouse", "dependent", and "family" in the policy are extended to include relationships created by a civil union according to Vermont law. Key terms referring to marriage-related events or family relationships arising from a marriage also apply to civil unions. A dependent is defined as a spouse, party of a civil union established under Vermont law, and child (natural, stepchild, legally adopted, or minor/disabled dependents) born or brought into the relationship. The term "child or covered child" refers to any such child. These definitions supersede previous ones within the policy, contract, certificate, riders, and endorsements.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf details that Vermont law grants civil union partners the same benefits, protections, and responsibilities as married couples under state law. However, federal laws such as ERISA may not extend these benefits to parties in a civil union regarding private employer health benefit plans. Governmental employers (excluding federal) are required to provide health benefits to the dependents of a civil union partner if they offer similar benefits to spouses. Federal laws also control group health insurance continuation rights under COBRA and Internal Revenue Code treatment of health insurance premiums, potentially limiting access to certain benefits for civil union families. Washington residents should note that the Surviving Spouse definition in the Survivor Income Benefit has been amended to include parties in a civil union. It is recommended to seek expert advice to determine rights under this contract.

This Hartford Cert 5361113 policy on page 37, row 1 indicates that the plan is not designed to offer complete health care coverage. Specifically, it does not meet the Minimum Creditable Coverage (MCC) as mandated by Massachusetts Health Connector regulations. This means that individuals who enroll in this particular insurance may face penalties for lacking adequate health coverage. To avoid these penalties, interested parties are advised to visit the Connector's website at www.mahealthconnector.org.

According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, the following details regarding the schedule of insurance are provided on page 40, rows 2-5:

   - The cost of coverage is applicable for eligible classes specified, with a defined eligibility waiting period before coverage kicks in.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf at pages 40, rows 7-10, the eligibility for this coverage is primarily limited to specified groups such as active employees, retirees, and surviving spouses or domestic partners. The coverage begins upon enrollment, with evidence of insurability required before it can be granted. If you meet the criteria but do not enroll within 31 days after receiving your offer, a late enrollment fee may apply. Additionally, if you terminate employment and wish to continue coverage as a retiree, you must enroll during the special enrollment period or risk forfeiting your eligibility.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, crucial coverage details are outlined from rows 12-21 on page 40. The policy becomes effective immediately (Effective Date) or at a later deferred date (Deferred Effective Date). Continuity from a prior policy is possible, and dependent policies may have their own effective, deferred effective, or continuity dates. Change in coverage or termination may occur on specified dates, while continuation provisions are addressed on page 48. Premium waiver information can be found on page 49.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (page 40, rows 23-31), this policy offers a Life Insurance Benefit with a Suicide Exclusion and an Accelerated Benefit option. A Conversion Right is available post-policy term, while Portability allows for the continuation of coverage if you change jobs. The Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefits are separately defined, complete with relevant conditions. Critical definitions are provided on page 54, followed by the associated benefits, exclusions, and requirements within the policy.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on page 41, row 1, this policy section outlines the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) provisions. It specifies that the plan administrator is responsible for all administrative duties and ensuring compliance with ERISA requirements. The plan must provide a summary of material modifications (SMM) to participants within 210 days after the end of the plan year in which the modification occurs or, if later, within 45 days following the date on which the plan administrator received the SMM from the plan sponsor. The plan may only be amended pursuant to a written instrument signed by the party executing it as the duly authorized representative of the plan, and any amendment must be consistent with ERISA and the terms of the governing instruments. Furthermore, the policy allows for limited plan termination under specific circumstances, including when the plan is unfunded, or if the plan's assets are insufficient to pay accrued benefits within one year after termination, in which case, the plan must provide for continuation of benefits until all accrued benefits are paid.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on page 41, row 4, the policy offers Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&D) benefits. The policy pays a benefit if the death or dismemberment is caused by an accident during the coverage period. The amount of the payout depends on the specific body part(s) affected and the severity of the injury. For instance, loss of sight in one eye results in 25% of the AD&D benefit, while total permanent disability due to an accident entitles the beneficiary to 100% of the benefit. The policy defines death as the result of bodily injury caused by violent, external, and accidental means. This coverage is available for a premium and will remain active as long as payments are made.
<EOS>
Under the Supplemental Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&D) section of Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, certain policyholders can receive additional benefits in case of accidental death or dismemberment. The coverage amount is equal to twice the Basic Life Insurance coverage or $50,000, whichever is greater. To be eligible for this benefit, the accident must occur within 90 days after joining the group, reinstating, increasing coverage, or converting the policy. In case of dismemberment, the loss of a hand, foot, eye, or other specified body parts will result in the payment of the corresponding percentage of the AD&D coverage. The maximum payment for accidental death is 100% of the coverage amount, while the maximum payments for other covered dismemberments are as follows: sight loss in one eye (25%), permanent total hearing loss in both ears (25%), and loss of two hands, feet, or limbs (25% each). This supplemental coverage expires at age 70.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 41 rows [2, 3, 1], all full-time active employees who are citizens or legal residents of the United States are eligible for coverage. However, this excludes physicians, executives, directors, temporary, leased, or seasonal employees. To be considered full-time, an employee must work at least 20 hours weekly, excluding on-call hours. This policy does not extend to employees in states, territories, or protectorates under specified conditions.
<EOS>
According to the Eligibility Waiting Period for Coverage on Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (page 41, rows 2, 1, 2), if you were previously a Full-time Active Employee under the Prior Policy, the waiting period for coverage is reduced by that duration. The reduction applies only to a continuous 60-day timeframe. In essence, the waiting period can be shortened if your previous employment aligns with the new policy requirements.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on page 41 row 1, the Basic Amount of Life Insurance provided is detailed. The coverage amounts are based on your annual salary at the time of purchase and the chosen multiplier. For instance, if your initial salary is $75,000 and you opt for a 2x multiplier, your life insurance coverage will be $150,000. This amount remains in force until you reach age 65, at which point it decreases annually by 1% until age 70, when the coverage terminates. Any additional riders or coverages may affect these figures.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 42 rows [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2], the amount you elect for your insurance coverage is in increments of $10,000, with a maximum of either $150,000 or 5 times your annual earnings, and $500,000 or 5 times your annual earnings, respectively. However, the minimum Supplemental Principal Sum is $10,000. Your combined Basic and Supplemental Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit will never exceed the amount of Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit on which premium for you has been paid.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on page 41 row 1, a supplemental amount of Dependent Life Insurance is offered. Eligible dependents include the policyholder's spouse and unmarried children under age 26. The maximum amount for dependent life insurance coverage is $50,000 per dependent or 50% of the policyholder's coverage amount, whichever is lower. If the insured person dies while the supplemental coverage is in effect, the beneficiary will receive the designated death benefit. The coverage can be purchased annually, semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly, with premium amounts based on the chosen coverage level and payment period. Premium adjustments are made at renewal dates. Changes to the beneficiary designation can be made at any time by providing written notice to The Hartford.
<EOS>
In the specified section of Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (pages 42, rows 2-3, 4, 1, 2, 3), it outlines that the coverage amount for your spouse can be elected in increments of $5,000, with a minimum coverage of $5,000 and a maximum of $250,000. It's important to note that the coverage for children is explained in separate sections. This provision applies solely to your spouse.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 42 (rows 1-3, 1-2, 3, 1, 1, 2), the Supplemental Principal Sum section outlines the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit for dependent children. If a child is aged between 15 days and less than 6 months, the benefit amount is $500; for children aged between 6 months and under 26 years old, it is $10,000. The supplemental benefit will never exceed the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit premium paid for the dependent child. This benefit remains in effect as long as the premium on which it is based continues to be paid.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf detail outlines Seat Belt and Air Bag Coverage. For accidents resulting from non-use of seat belts or air bags, the policy offers a Seat Belt Benefit Amount equal to 43% of the Basic Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D) Principal Sum, with a maximum of $50,000 and a minimum of $1,000.

<EOS>
In the Child Education Benefit detailed on pages 43, rows 1-3 of Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, a maximum of 5% of the combined Basic & Supplemental Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&D) Principal Sum can be allocated for this benefit.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 43, rows 1-3, the Day Care Benefit offers a maximum of 5% of the Combined Basic & Supplemental Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&D) Principal Sum, with a maximum payout of $5,000. The minimum benefit for this coverage is set at $1,250. This benefit provides financial assistance to help cover day care expenses if the policyholder dies or becomes dismembered due to an accident covered under their AD&D policy.
<EOS>
According to the Rehabilitation Benefit section on Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (pages 43, rows 1-2), a maximum of 5% of the combined Basic and Supplemental Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D) Principal Sum is available for rehabilitation benefits. The maximum amount that can be received under this benefit is $5,000. This provision provides coverage for expenses related to rehabilitation following an accident resulting in injury, with the goal of restoring or maximizing the insured's physical function and independence. The benefits are payable after the insured has been out of work for a consecutive 30 days due to the covered injury.
<EOS>
In accordance with the Spouse Education Benefit outlined on Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf pages 43 rows 1-3, a policyholder is eligible to grant their spouse a maximum of 5% of the combined Basic and Supplemental Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D) principal sum, up to a maximum amount of $5,000. However, a minimum benefit of $1,250 must be guaranteed. This benefit serves to support the spouse's educational expenses in case of the policyholder's accidental death or dismemberment.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf section outlines the Adaptive Home and Vehicle Benefit, detailing a maximum contribution of 5% towards the combined Basic & Supplemental Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D) Principal Sum, capped at $5,000. To qualify for this benefit, an insured individual must suffer a qualifying loss and be rendered permanently unable to perform daily activities without assistance. The payment is made directly towards modifying the home or vehicle of the insured, up to the maximum cap, to accommodate their needs resulting from the covered injury. This provision applies only to policies purchased on or after January 1, 2021.
<EOS>
Under the terms of Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, any existing life insurance policies you or your dependents have may cause a reduction in the policy's coverage amount. This reduction can occur via conversion rights, portability provisions, or under the prior policy. These reductions apply if such insurance is paid or payable upon death.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf detail outlines age-related coverage reductions. Upon reaching age 65, a 35% reduction in both Life Insurance Benefit and Principal Sum will be applied on the Policy Anniversary Date that follows. At age 70, an additional 60% reduction takes effect. These reductions apply to pre-existing coverage amounts when adjustments occur post-age 65, whether due to new coverage for You or Your Spouse, or increases in existing coverage. The revised coverage amounts will round up to the nearest $500 multiple (if not already so). An appropriate premium adjustment will be made accordingly.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, eligibility for coverage is granted on the earliest of three conditions: firstly, the Participating Employer's Effective Date; secondly, the date you join an Eligible Class; or thirdly, upon completion of the Eligibility Waiting Period for Coverage shown in the Schedule of Insurance, if applicable.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, eligibility for Dependent coverage occurs on the later of two conditions: either the date you become insured for employee coverage or the acquisition of your first Dependent. However, a Dependent cannot be covered if they are already an employee under the policy. No employee can insure more than one Dependent under The Policy.
<EOS>
As per the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, non-contributory coverage is automatically provided by your employer; however, a beneficiary designation form must be completed. For contributory coverage, you need to submit a group insurance enrollment form within 31 days after eligibility or from the previous policy, if eligible but not enrolled earlier. Late enrollment may require Evidence of Insurability.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, Evidence of Insurability is required under the following conditions: if enrollment occurs more than 31 days after initial eligibility, for amounts exceeding the Supplemental Guaranteed Issue Amount regardless of timing, or if previously eligible coverage was declined from the Prior Policy and later opted for coverage under The Policy. If provided Evidence of Insurability is deemed unsatisfactory by the insurer, the Life Insurance amount will match the eligible amount without providing evidence, given enrollment within 31 days of initial eligibility; otherwise, coverage will not be available under The Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 44 and 45, evidence of insurability is required for dependents' initial coverage under specific conditions: enrollment after the first eligibility date, exceeding the guaranteed issue amount for dependent life insurance, or enrolling when previously covered under a prior policy but not doing so. However, no evidence is needed if the dependent child's life insurance amount is $15,000 or less, or if dependents had previous coverage through your spouse's employer group plan and apply within 31 days of losing that coverage, providing proof of prior coverage, including termination date. If evidence provided isn't satisfactory, the dependent's life insurance amount equals their eligible amount without evidence, given enrollment within 31 days of first eligibility; otherwise, dependents won't be covered under the policy if enrolled more than 31 days after first eligibility.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, Evidence of Insurability is a set of requirements for policy coverage that may include a completed application, medical examination, attending physician's statement, and additional information as needed. This evidence will typically be furnished by The Hartford at no cost except in cases of late enrollment. The Hartford will then assess if you or your dependents are eligible for initial coverage or an increase in coverage under the policy, as detailed in the Increase in Amount of Life Insurance provision. Any decisions regarding Evidence of Insurability will be communicated to you in writing.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 45, rows 2-10, your insurance coverage or changes in benefits (either for an increase or a new benefit) will not take effect if you are not actively working due to a physical or mental condition on the scheduled start date. Coverage will only commence when you return to active work.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf pages [45, 46], if you were insured under a prior policy on the day before the Participating Employer's effective date but were not actively working on that date, your coverage under the new policy will begin immediately, without deferment. The amount of insurance will be the lesser of the life insurance and Accidental Death and Dismemberment Principal Sum you had under the prior policy or as shown in the Schedule of Insurance, reduced by any coverage already in force or payable under the prior policy. Coverage ends after 12 consecutive months from the Participating Employer's effective date unless your insurance terminates for other reasons, the prior policy terminates, or you return to active work. If your coverage ends due to active work, you may be eligible for Active Employee coverage under the new policy. The covered amount is subject to reductions in the new policy and will not increase.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, dependent coverage begins on the later of two dates: either the date you become eligible for coverage, if you enroll by that date; or the date you enroll within 31 days after becoming eligible, if later. If evidence of insurability is required, coverage becomes effective upon the later of the eligible date and our approval of your dependents' insurability. In no case will dependent coverage start before your own insurance begins. Evidence of insurability is necessary for certain types of coverage.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, the effective date for dependent coverage or changes in coverage (either under the policy, for increased benefits, or a new benefit) is deferred if, on the coverage start date, the dependent is either confined in a hospital or elsewhere. Coverage does not begin until the dependent is discharged from the hospital or no longer confined elsewhere and has participated in all normal activities of a healthy person of similar age and gender for 15 consecutive days, except for disabled children who qualify as dependents. This Deferred Effective Date provision does not apply to these specific cases.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, section on page 46 row 2, 'Confined Elsewhere' refers to a dependent who is unable, without assistance, to perform daily living functions normally or leave their home or other residence. This applies when the dependent requires continuous care at a hospital, nursing facility, or other institution due to sickness or injury. The policy covers such confinement as long as it exceeds 14 days.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, if dependents were covered on the day before a new policy's effective date under the prior policy, they will not be affected by the Deferred Effective Date provision in this new policy. The amount of insurance for dependents will be the lesser of what they had under the prior policy or what is shown in the Schedule of Insurance, reduced by any coverage already paid or payable under the prior policy. This reduction applies to both timely elected and untimely elected coverages under the prior policy. It's important to note that this reduction doesn't affect the amount of life insurance or accidental death and dismemberment principal sum for dependents under the new policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 46 and 47, you can modify your coverage or that of your dependents at any time after your initial enrollment. This includes increasing, decreasing, or altering your coverage, as well as adding a new dependent to the existing dependent coverage. These changes can be made whenever necessary.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, any reduction in coverage becomes effective immediately upon the change. Increases in coverage, however, become effective on the latest of three scenarios: firstly, the date of the change; secondly, when the Deferred Effective Date provision conditions are fulfilled; or thirdly, once Evidence of Insurability is approved if required. These provisions apply to rows 2-7 on page 47 of the document.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf section outlines requirements for increasing life insurance coverage. If dependents are already enrolled for supplemental life insurance under the policy, they must provide evidence of insurability for any increase. For those not currently enrolled, the same rule applies to initial amounts. If the requested life insurance amount exceeds the Guaranteed Issue Amount, evidence of insurability is mandatory. Unsatisfactory evidence will result in no change to the existing coverage. This applies to both the policyholder and their dependents.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, if your life insurance amount is tied to a multiple of your earnings and increases due to an income rise, you must provide evidence of insurability if the increased coverage exceeds the Guaranteed Issue Amount. Premium increases will correspond with this expanded coverage. Once approved, no further proof of insurability is needed for future earnings-based increases. However, failure to supply evidence or providing unsatisfactory information may limit your coverage increase to the previously eligible amount and prevent any further increases until approval is granted.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, your coverage will terminate on the earliest of six conditions: the policy termination date, your ineligibility for coverage or the policy no longer insuring your class, unpaid premium due dates, employment termination by your employer, you being no longer Actively at Work, or your employer ceasing to be a Participating Employer. However, continuation may occur under certain provisions.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, dependent coverage terminates under the following conditions: it ends on the earliest of five scenarios: 1) the date your coverage ceases, 2) when premiums due are not paid, 3) when you become ineligible for dependent coverage, 4) if we or the employer terminate dependent coverage, or 5) if the dependent no longer meets the definition of a dependent. However, this may be continued under the continuation provisions.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (pages [48, 49]) outlines continuation provisions for insurance coverage and dependents' coverage. Coverage can be extended beyond the termination date if an employer provides a plan for all employees equally, but it cannot be continued under more than one continuation provision. The coverage amount remains the same as on the ending date and is subject to policy reductions, premium payments, and time limits.

   During leaves of absence (except Family and Military Leave or Medical Leave), insurance coverage, including dependents', may continue until the month following the leave's commencement. For military leaves, coverage can be extended for up to 12 weeks, while Family Military Leaves may extend up to 30 days if certain conditions are met.

   If an employee is laid off due to lack of work, insurance coverage continues until the month following the layoff commencement. In case of permanent layoffs or a status change resulting from reduced hours, coverage ceases after three consecutive months. If an employee is temporarily disabled, receiving disability benefits, and earning between 20-80% of their pre-disability earnings, insurance coverage can be continued.

   Coverage may also be extended for up to 12 months if an employee is not actively working due to sickness or injury; however, the combined continuation period does not exceed 12 months in case of leaves according to family and medical leave laws. Family Medical Leaves may extend up to 12 weeks, 26 weeks with Family Military Leave, or longer as required by applicable law.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, if your dependent child(ren) are aged 26 or older, disabled, and primarily depend on you for financial support, their coverage will not terminate due to age. Proof of disability must be submitted within 31 days upon reaching such age, with the disability having occurred before age 26. Coverage continues as long as you remain insured, the child meets these conditions, and premiums are paid on time. No increase in life insurance amount for dependent children is available, and proof of continued eligibility may be required every two years initially, then annually thereafter.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf provision, found on pages 49 rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], outlines the Waiver of Premium for life insurance coverage. If you become disabled and meet the qualifications, your coverage will continue without premium payments. The continued coverage amount is equivalent to that in force on the date you cease being an active employee, subject to any reductions stated within the policy, and will not increase.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, the eligible coverages under this provision are limited to your Basic Life Insurance, Supplemental Life Insurance, and Dependent Life Insurance. However, it is important to note that you cannot apply for both the Portability Benefit and Waiver of Premium for the same coverage amount. These provisions apply without exception.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 49 and 50 (rows 2-10), 'Disabled' means you are unable to perform any work for which you're qualified due to injury or illness based on education, training, or experience. Additionally, a diagnosis of a life expectancy of 12 months or less qualifies as Disabled. This definition applies throughout the duration of this policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, to qualify for the Waiver of Premium provision, one must be under age 60 and covered under the policy while becoming Disabled. Proof of a Disability lasting six consecutive months is required, starting from the last day actively working. This proof must be submitted within one year after cessation of active employment. The Waiver of Premium is only applicable if you were actively at work under the policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, premiums may be waived if disabled, but this won't occur during the initial 6 months of disability. The insurer can request proof of disability and conduct examinations within the first two years, not more than once a year thereafter. Failure to provide required proof or refuse examination results in termination of premium waiver. However, if the application for premium waiver is denied, alternative options like portability benefit continuation or conversion right may be available. If disabled for less than 6 months and returning to work for up to 5 days, the waiting period will not be interrupted; however, any additional work beyond 5 days necessitates a new waiting period. The same condition must cause disability throughout the entire 6-month period if returning to work for fewer than 5 days.
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, if you or your dependent dies within a year after leaving active employment but before qualifying for Waiver of Premium, the insurance policy will pay the in-force life insurance amount for the deceased person under three conditions: firstly, if you are disabled continuously and this disability would have lasted six months or more; secondly, premiums must be consistently paid for coverage. If these conditions are met, the insurance will provide coverage despite not yet qualifying for Waiver of Premium.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, the Waiver of Premium will continue for you while disabled (until Normal Retirement Age if disabled before 60). For dependent life insurance, coverage is maintained until one of five conditions occur: death, loss of eligibility, policy termination or employer ceasing as a Participating Employer, dependents leaving an Eligible Class, or no longer meeting the definition of Dependent. If disabled and unable to return to work in an Eligible Class, coverage ends but you may exercise the Conversion Right within specific time limits. The amount convertible is subject to the terms and conditions of the Conversion Right; portability is not available. Upon Waiver of Premium cessation, if you resume employment in an Eligible Class, you may again be eligible for coverage.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on page 51 (rows 1-5, 1-2, 3-4, 5-7, 1-2, 3-4, 5), if your policy terminates or your employer ceases to be a Participating Employer before you qualify for Waiver of Premium: you may exercise the Conversion Right within the stipulated time limits and could still be approved for Waiver of Premium if you meet the qualifications. However, if your policy terminates or your employer stops participating after you've qualified for Waiver of Premium, your Dependent coverage will end, and your coverage under this provision will remain unchanged.
<EOS>
In accordance with the Hartford Cert 5361113.PDF, if you or your dependents pass away while insured under this policy, a Life Insurance Benefit will be disbursed upon receipt of valid Proof of Loss, as per the stated Proof of Loss provision. The Life Insurance Benefit distribution follows the general policy provisions. The benefit is payable only once, and its amount remains unaffected by any future changes in this policy. The Life Insurance Benefit will be paid out post-death.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on page [67], rows [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], details suicide-related conditions. If You or Your Dependent commit suicide within a year of coverage, no Supplemental Amount of Life Insurance or Dependent Life Insurance will be paid for those elected during the preceding year. Premiums paid are refunded under these circumstances. If death occurs due to suicide within one year of the Policy effective date, all premiums are returned. This period includes group life insurance coverage under the Prior Policy.

Regarding Accidental Death and Dismemberment, suicide or attempted suicide is excluded, whether sane or insane. For Montana residents, the Conversion Right period changes to 3 years if greater than 3 years, and the dollar amount to $10,000 if less. The second paragraph of the Conversion Policy Provisions is deleted, and the dollar amount stated in the Claims to be Paid provision is changed to $500 if not $500. A new provision added to Claims to be Paid stipulates that no benefit will be paid for suicide or attempted suicide.

This Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf section (pages [51, 52], rows [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 1]) details the Accelerated Benefit feature. If a policyholder or dependent is terminally ill and covered for an insurance amount of at least $10,000 before age 60, The Hartford will pay an accelerated benefit (ranging from $3,000 to 80% of the insurance amount, with a maximum of $500,000). This payment reduces the policyholder's death benefit. Requests for this benefit must be made in writing. If a person provides proof of their terminal illness, they will also qualify for the Waiver of Premium definition as disabled. However, legal or governmental acceleration requirements and any assigned rights to the insurance amount may affect eligibility for this benefit.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, page 52, sections [2, 3, 1, 2], the policy reserves the right to demand consistent proof of Terminal Illness, provided by a Physician. Failure to submit satisfactory evidence or refusal to undergo examination by a Physician as required may prevent the payment of Accelerated Benefits.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 52 rows [2-12], if a policyholder or dependent diagnosed as terminally ill recovers, their coverage continues only under specific conditions:

1. If they return to an Eligible Class and premium is paid, the coverage remains in force.
2. If they do not return to an Eligible Class but remain disabled (subject to the Waiver of Premium provision), the coverage persists.
3. If neither condition applies (i.e., they are not in an Eligible Class and no longer disabled), coverage terminates, allowing for possible exercise of the Conversion Right within stipulated time limits.
4. In all cases, the amount of coverage is reduced by the Accelerated Benefit paid.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages [52] rows [2-15], if your life insurance coverage under the policy terminates for any reason, you and your dependents may have the right to convert this coverage to an individual policy without providing evidence of insurability, excluding Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefits or amounts not eligible for coverage.

If termination occurs due to the policy termination, cessation of coverage for an eligible class, or your employer no longer being a participating employer, you must have been insured under the policy for at least 5 years to be eligible for conversion. The maximum amount convertible in such cases is the lesser of $10,000 or the policy's life insurance benefit, minus any new group life coverage within 31 days of termination.

For other reasons of termination, the full amount that ended may be converted. Conversion rights are not available for amounts ineligible for coverage under the policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, on row 2 of page 52, the term "Insurer" encompasses either us or another insurance company agreeing to issue conversion policies according to this Conversion Right. This provision allows policyholders to convert their existing policy into a new one under different terms without evidence of insurability when certain conditions are met, typically upon the policy anniversary date following a qualifying event such as retirement or termination of employment. The new policy will be issued at the full cost of premiums based on the age and health status prevailing at the time of conversion. Notably, the conversion period usually lasts for a specified duration, often 31 days after the qualifying event or policy anniversary date, whichever is longer.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf pages [52, 53], to convert your or your dependents' coverage after life insurance termination, complete a Notice of Conversion Right form and have your employer sign it. This must be submitted within 31 days post-termination or 15 days from the employer's signature, whichever is later, but not more than 91 days after termination. Upon eligibility verification, a conversion policy proposal will be sent for you to complete and pay the specified premium within the given timeframe. The issued individual policy becomes effective on the 32nd day following coverage end, replacing any prior coverage under the policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, the Conversion Policy provides Life Insurance coverage based on current Insurer rates for your age and class at conversion, but does not offer the same terms as the original policy, additional benefits beyond the Life Insurance benefit, or term insurance. However, Conversion is not available for insurance amounts being continued in accordance with Waiver of Premium, Portability, or Continuation Provisions until such coverage ends. The issued Conversion Policy will be based on one of the Insurer's applicable forms at the time of conversion.
<EOS>
Under the Death within the Conversion Period of Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, if coverage terminates and you or your dependent dies within 31 days, we will pay the Amount of Life Insurance you would have been eligible to apply for, provided that we receive Proof of Loss. If a Conversion Policy has already taken effect, no Life Insurance Benefit is payable under the original policy for the amount converted.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 53 rows 2 and 3, Portability is a feature that enables you and your dependents to maintain coverage under a Group Portability policy even when regular coverage would cease due to specific Qualifying Events. Notably, this provision applies solely to Life Insurance. Essentially, Portability ensures continuity of coverage in the event of certain job changes or life events that might otherwise terminate your insurance coverage.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, qualifying events for the policyholder include termination of employment before Normal Retirement Age or ending membership in an Eligible Class. For dependents, these events are the policyholder's termination, death, cessation of eligible class membership, or no longer meeting the definition of Dependent. Note that a Dependent Child who reaches the limiting age under the Policy is not eligible for Portability.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf pages [53, 54], you can elect Portability for your coverage upon a Qualifying Event within 31 days of Life Insurance termination or 15 days after the Employer signs the application (whichever is later), but not more than 91 days post-termination. Dependent coverage continuation requires the policyholder or spouse to elect. The process involves completing and having your employer sign a Portability application, submitting it with required premium within the stipulated timeframe, and approval results in a new Portability policy without Evidence of Insurability. Effective on the day following the end of coverage, this policy's terms differ from those under The Policy. Employer continuation as a Participant Employer is necessary for Portability availability.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on page 54, you can continue 50%, 75%, or 100% of ending Life Insurance coverage for yourself or your dependents, rounded up to the nearest $1,000 multiple if necessary. However, the maximum amount that can be continued is:
   - $250,000 for you
   - $50,000 for your spouse
   - $10,000 for your dependent child(ren).
   If you elect to continue 50% or 75% now, you cannot continue any portion of the remaining amount at a later date. The minimum amount that can be continued is $5,000. Portability is not available if you or your dependents are entering active military service or were not previously eligible and covered under this provision. Additionally, neither you nor your spouse can continue an Amount of Life Insurance which is less than $5,000.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, portability is not applicable for life insurance amounts being continued via the conversion right, waiver of premium provision, or continuation provisions within the policy. If only a portion of terminated coverage is elected under portability, or if the amount exceeds the maximum, the conversion right may be utilized for the remaining amount. However, the waiver of premium provision will not apply if coverage is continued via this portability provision.
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit is payable if You or Your Dependents suffer an injury causing specified losses within 365 days of the accident date. The Principal Sum, as shown in the Schedule of Insurance, will be paid to the injured person in accordance with the Proof of Loss provision and the General Policy provisions. This benefit may not exceed the Principal Sum for all losses resulting from a single accident. The percentage of Your Dependents' Principal Sum is also specified in the Schedule of Insurance. Specifically, if an injury results in the following losses: death, loss of two or more limbs, sight in both eyes, speech, or hearing, payment will be made according to the loss as outlined in the policy. No more than the Principal Sum will be paid to any one person for all losses stemming from a single accident.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 54 and 55, the life benefit payout is determined by the degree of loss or impairment suffered. The principal sum is paid out in full if the policyholder loses both hands, feet, or sight in both eyes; one hand and one foot; speech and hearing in both ears; either hand or foot, and sight in one eye; movement of both upper and lower limbs (Quadriplegia); both lower limbs (Paraplegia); three-quarters of the principal sum for movement of three limbs (Triplegia) or one side of the body (Hemiplegia).

One-half of the principal sum is paid out for loss of either hand or foot; sight in one eye; speech or hearing in both ears; movement of one limb (Uniplegia); thumb and index finger of either hand. Furthermore, the payout for loss of a single limb or body part is one-quarter of the principal sum.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 55, rows 2-9, "Loss" is defined as:

1. The actual severance of hands or feet above the wrist or ankle joints.
2. The entire and irrecoverable loss of sight, speech, or hearing.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, page [55], the Seat Belt and Air Bag Benefit is payable when You or Your Dependents sustain an injury resulting in a loss under the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit. This benefit is applicable if the injured person was either a passenger wearing a seatbelt or the licensed operator of a properly registered motor vehicle, both verified on the police accident report. The Seat Belt Benefit is the lesser of the amount resulting from multiplying the injured person's Principal Sum by the Seat Belt Benefit Percentage or the Maximum Amount for this Benefit. Similarly, an Air Bag Benefit will be paid if the injured person was positioned in a seat equipped with a factory-installed airbag, properly strapped in at the time of the accident when the airbag inflated. The Air Bag Benefit is also the lesser of the amount resulting from multiplying the injured person's Principal Sum by the Air Bag Benefit Percentage or the Maximum Amount for this Benefit. If it cannot be determined whether the injured person was wearing a seatbelt at the time of the accident, a Minimum Benefit will be payable under the Seat Belt Benefit. All payments are subject to Proof of Loss in accordance with the policy's Proof of Loss provision and the General Provisions of The Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, page 55 row 2, an 'Accident' is defined as an unintentional collision of a Motor Vehicle. Crucially, for the purpose of this Benefit alone, the injured person must have been wearing a Seat Belt during the incident. This provision emphasizes safety precautions while driving.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, an Air Bag is defined as an inflatable supplemental passive restraint system installed by a Motor Vehicle manufacturer that inflates upon collision to protect individuals from injury and death. Crucially, it should be replaced with the correct parts, following the manufacturer's specifications. It is distinct from a Seat Belt.

According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on pages 55 and 56, a Seat Belt is defined as either an unaltered belt or lap restraint, or lap and shoulder restraint installed by the Motor Vehicle manufacturer, or their approved replacements, per the manufacturer's specifications. Alternatively, it can be a child restraint device compliant with the National Safety Council standards, properly used and installed as per state law and the manufacturer's recommendations for children of similar age and weight. However, the Seat Belt and Air Bag Benefit will not be payable if the injured person is operating the Motor Vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs, including but not limited to sedatives, narcotics, barbiturates, amphetamines, or hallucinogens, unless they are prescribed by or administered by a Physician.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, intoxication is defined as having a blood alcohol content (BAC) or the results of other means testing BAC that meets or exceeds the legal presumption of intoxication or being under the influence, in accordance with the laws of the state where the accident occurred.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (pages 56, rows 2-12), if you or your dependents suffer a fatal injury covered under the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit outside of their permanent residence's territorial limits, an additional Repatriation Benefit is payable. This benefit covers either the least expensive option among: a) actual costs for preparing the body for burial/cremation and transporting it to its final resting place; b) the product of the deceased person's Principal Sum multiplied by the Repatriation Benefit Percentage; or c) the Maximum Amount specified in the policy's Schedule of Insurance.

The document also reserves the right to determine if any other full-time status is met by the student. The specific amounts for this benefit are detailed in the Schedule of Insurance.
<EOS>
In the event of the policyholder's or their spouse's death due to an accident that triggers the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit, The Hartford will pay a Day Care Benefit for each child under 7 years old. Eligibility requires enrollment in a day care program as detailed in this benefit and adherence to the policy's general provisions. Payment occurs annually for up to four installments per child.

Proof of enrollment, deemed satisfactory by The Hartford, includes a copy of the child's approved day care application, cancelled checks proving payment to a facility or provider, or a letter from the day care facility or provider stating the child is attending or will attend within 365 days of the death date.

According to the Bonuses definition in Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf (page 63, rows 2-5), the term refers to the average of monetary bonuses received during either the one calendar year immediately preceding the date of last Active employment or, if shorter, the entire period worked for an employer. In other words, if you have received bonuses over a longer period than one year, only the bonuses from the most recent complete year and any additional time spent with the current employer are considered.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, the term "Commissions" refers to the average monetary commissions you received over either a one-year period immediately preceding your last active employment (if this duration exceeds the total time you worked for an employer) or the entire period of employment with that employer, whichever is less.

According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, your Normal Retirement Age (NRA) is defined by the United States Social Security Act, determined by your birth date. Specifically, if you were born between January 1943 and December 1954, your NRA is 66. If born after 1954, your NRA increases incrementally until reaching 67 for those born in 1960 or later. These adjustments reflect the most recent amendments to the Act. For instance, if you were born in 1955, your NRA is 66 and 2 months, while those born in 1956 have an NRA of 66 and 4 months. This age is significant as it determines when you can begin receiving full retirement benefits under the Social Security system.

<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, the term 'Prior Policy' refers to the group life insurance policy held by the Participating Employer on the day preceding the current policy.

These individuals may be entitled to certain benefits under specified circumstances.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, it is stated that a spouse can be defined as one's legally non-separated or non-divorced partner, or a domestic partner/civil union partner (provided you have executed a domestic partner affidavit satisfying the insurer or registered with a government agency where such registration is available). For Wisconsin residents, specific dollar amounts in certain provisions are adjusted to $5,000, $1,000, and $1,000, respectively. The policy remains unchanged in all other aspects, signed by Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company.
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf on page 66 (rows 4-11), a dependent is defined as your spouse and/or your child(ren). To qualify as a dependent, the individual must be a U.S. citizen or resident of its territories and protectorates. Persons in full-time military service can't be considered dependents, unless they are subsequently called to military duty, and any required premiums are paid. The age limit for continuation of dependent children with disabilities is extended to 21 if under that age. Additionally, a provision has been added to the Period of Coverage, stating that if a dependent child is less than 26 years old and enrolled in full-time education, they can be covered until age 29.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf section on reinstatement after military service details that coverage terminates upon active military service, but if you're rehired within 12 months of the termination or return date, and request reinstatement within 31 days of returning to work, your coverage for yourself and any previously covered dependents can be restored without evidence of insurability or waiting periods. The reinstated coverage will maintain the same amounts as before, comply with all policy terms, and may include partial life insurance benefit payment up to $500 for funeral expenses.

The Seatbelt and Air Bag Benefit exclusion now states it won't be payable if the injured person is intoxicated or under the influence of narcotics, unless on a physician's advice.

For Massachusetts residents, the definition of Terminal Illness or Terminally Ill in the Accelerated Benefit cannot exceed 24 months. Michigan residents no longer have the Policy Interpretation provision, and Minnesota residents retain the Military Leave of Absence portion of the Continuation section.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf at pages 66 rows 4 and 5, the provision titled "Lay Off" has been removed from the Continuation Provisions and replaced with a new provision for documented military leave of absence. This change allows policyholders who are on active military duty or called to active military service to have their coverage maintained without interruption during their leave period. The duration of this military leave coverage depends on the length of active military duty, up to a maximum of 365 days with a potential extension for additional periods of up to 182 days each. Additionally, upon returning from military leave, policyholders may be eligible for reinstatement of their coverage without evidence of insurability, subject to certain conditions and limitations as outlined in the policy document.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf detail specifies the Lay Off coverage terms. If you're terminated or laid off, you can elect to continue coverage by making monthly premium payments to your employer. You must make this decision within 60 days from either the coverage termination date or receiving written notice of your right to continue coverage. The maximum charged premium should not exceed 102% of the previous life insurance coverage premium for an active employee. Your employer will notify you about your continuation option, the monthly premium amount, and payment procedures. Coverage continues until another group policy is in effect or 18 months after termination/layoff, at which point conversion rights apply (within certain time limits). Minnesota law stipulates that if coverage ends due to employer noncompliance regarding notice or premium payment, the employer remains liable for benefit payments. A reduction in working hours resulting in ineligibility for coverage is considered a layoff. Termination does not include dismissal for gross misconduct but includes retirement. The 7th paragraph of the Accelerated Benefit provision and the 2nd to 4th paragraphs of the Conversion Right provision have been amended, as well as the first sentence of the 5th paragraph of the Claims to be Paid provision. For Missouri residents, time period modifications apply to the Conditions for Qualification and Benefit Payable before Approval provisions. If benefits exceed $15,000, they can be paid into a draft book account owned by the policyholder or their beneficiary upon request.
<EOS>
In the specified section of Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, a 180-day waiting period is enforced for Waiver of Premium provisions, extending the original duration if it's less than 180 days. Approved waivers will be effective from the onset of disability. Additionally, the Suicide provision has been replaced with new terms.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf details that death claims will be paid within 60 days of proof submission, with interest added if the payment is over 30 days late, at the current discount rate for 90-day commercial paper from the Federal Reserve Bank in the Ninth District. Notably, New Hampshire residents face adjustments to the Waiver of Premium and Disability Extension provision, Conversion provision, and Sending Proof of Loss provision. Specifically, the former is deleted; the latter removes item #3. Additionally, the Notice of Conversion Right form will be sent within 15 days after policy termination, with an extended conversion period if notice is given later than that. Furthermore, unless notice was not provided, requests for Conversion will not be accepted more than 91 days after life insurance terminates. Lastly, the dollar amount stated in the Claims to be Paid provision may change from $250 depending on the situation. If Spouse Accidental Death and Dismemberment is included, the Period of Coverage section includes relevant details.

Notably, for North Dakota residents, life insurance amounts within the first year of coverage or following an increase in coverage are excluded due to suicide. For Ohio residents, any references to Accelerated Benefit are amended to read as Accelerated Death Benefit. For Oregon residents, the spouse definition is amended as follows:

"Spouse" definition amended: Spouse means a person of the opposite sex to whom you are legally married or with whom you are in a domestic-partnership relationship recognized by the state where the insured resides.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf section defines 'Spouse' as an individual under age 65 who is not legally separated or divorced and not in active military service outside specific areas, while those serving within these areas are considered Dependents. Domestic partners can be recognized if a domestic partner affidavit is executed or registration with a government agency is made. This document also includes children of an Oregon registered domestic partner under the Dependent Child definition.

For claims, South Carolina requires autopsies to occur within the state and alters the amount to $2,000. South Dakota modifies certain exclusions, including suicide within two years of coverage, speed or endurance contest injuries, and felony-related injuries. It also deletes self-inflicted injury, intoxicated, driving while intoxicated, and seat belt/airbag exclusions, as well as the definition of "Intoxicated".

For employers with 10 or more employees in certain states, coverage can be continued during Jury Duty if elected and proper notice is given. These provisions are subject to changes based on local laws or requirements specified in a domestic partner affidavit.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf outlines specifics for the Felonious Assault coverage.

Additionally, a new Continuation provision has been added, and the phrase "In the absence of fraud" is omitted from the Incontestability provision.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, disability coverage can be continued beyond the termination date, but not under multiple continuation provisions. The amount of coverage is determined by the level in effect immediately before its intended end. Coverage continues for the earliest of six months post-disability, approval of continued coverage under any policy disability provision, unpaid premium due date, policy termination, or cessation of the participating employer if the policyholder is a trust. No increase in insurance is allowed during continuation. The continuation provisions can't be applied consecutively. If an absence results in a leave of absence according to state and federal family and medical leave laws, the combined continuation period will not exceed twelve consecutive months. For Vermont residents, an applicable endorsement applies.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, this endorsement extends benefits to parties of a Vermont-established civil union and their families, similar to those offered in insurance contracts for married persons and their families. To qualify, the civil union must comply with Vermont law.

Terms related to marital relationships or construed as such (e.g., marriage, spouse, husband, wife, dependent, next of kin, relative, beneficiary, survivor, immediate family) now include those created by a civil union.

Likewise, terms associated with family relationships arising from a marriage (e.g., family, immediate family, dependent, children, next of kin, relative, beneficiary, survivor) encompass the family relationship stemming from a civil union. Similarly, terms linked to the inception or dissolution of a marriage (e.g., date of marriage, divorce decree, termination of marriage) now apply to the inception or dissolution of a civil union.

The definition of "dependent" includes a spouse, a party to a civil union, and/or a child or children born to or brought into a marriage or civil union, who depend on the insured for support and maintenance. Furthermore, "child or covered child" refers to any child (natural, step-child, legally adopted, or minor) dependent on the insured and brought into a marriage or civil union.
<EOS>

<EOS>
In the Life Insurance Benefit provision of Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, interest is payable from the deceased's date of death to the payment date, at a rate of 6% annually or our corporate rate, whichever is higher. Washington residents see a change in the Suicide provision, as it has been completely removed. For those no longer terminally ill residing in Washington, a modification has been added:

If you recover from being terminally ill and survive for more than 180 days after receiving payment, any additional benefit payments will be reduced by the amount we have already paid out to you, plus an adjustment factor that reflects the increased life expectancy due to your recovery. The adjusted amount will be calculated using our proprietary mortality tables, and this reduction applies only if the total of your policy's accumulated value and the additional benefit payment exceeds the maximum allowed by law in your state.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf section details key policy provisions. If there's a disagreement about a terminal illness diagnosis, the opinions of both parties will not be binding. Efforts should be made to resolve this discrepancy promptly and amicably, failing which either party may opt for mediation or binding arbitration by a neutral third party within the State of Washington. The final decision will determine costs allocation.

A labor dispute may continue coverage (including Dependent Life) for up to six months past termination, with immediate cessation upon labor dispute resolution. This provision supersedes any previous labor dispute continuation provisions.

The policy interpretation provision has been removed. The definition of a Dependent Child(ren) now includes those in domestic partnership relationships, and the Spouse definition has been amended accordingly.

During a disability, the insured employee may return to full-time work for up to the Elimination Period without affecting this period. Only days of disability due to the same or related sickness or injury are counted towards the Elimination Period, while days on which the employee returns to full-time work do not count. The Elimination Period applies only to days of disability.

These duties should normally be expected to perform in the scope of the insured person's regular occupation.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf on pages 7, the term 'Medically Appropriate Treatment' refers to diagnostic services, consultations, or care that align with the symptoms or diagnosis of the Insured Employee's Disability.

The benefit amount is determined based on the employee's earnings and the percentage of disability, as specified in the policy. The payments continue until the employee recovers completely or reaches the policy's maximum duration. This benefit does not apply if the disability results from a pre-existing condition unless it meets certain conditions outlined in the policy.
<EOS>
According to the Partial Disability definition on Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, page 7 row 26, a policyholder becomes eligible for partial disability benefits if they are unable to perform one essential job duty due to sickness or injury and can still earn less than their pre-disability income performing alternative work. The defined earnings reduction required to qualify is 20%. Payments will continue until the policyholder's earnings reach 80% of their pre-disability income or they return to work full time. These benefits are subject to a waiting period of three months following the disability onset date.

Under this policy, monthly earnings are crucial for determining benefits. The policyholder is entitled to receive a percentage of their basic monthly earnings in the event of a predisability, as long as they meet the continuous service requirement of two years post-benefit effective date. Additionally, the policy stipulates that benefits cease upon death or retirement, but any remaining balance can be paid out as a lump sum to the policyholder's beneficiary. The policy also includes a provision for cost-of-living adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf on pages 8 (rows 5-11), the term 'Regular Care of a Physician' or 'Regular Attendance of a Physician' entails that the Insured Employee must personally visit a Physician, as frequently as medically required under standard medical practice to manage and treat their disabling condition effectively.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf on pages 8, rows 14-20, the Regular or Own Occupation refers to the occupation, trade, or profession that the Insured Employee was employed in prior to Disability and served as their primary income source.

The definition includes the main duties of that occupation as commonly performed in the national workforce, not specific to a certain firm or work site.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, a Retirement Benefit, defined within the context of a Retirement Plan, is a benefit that can be paid either in a lump sum or as periodic payments. It is essential to note that this benefit does not represent contributions made by an Employee; employee contributions are considered received over their expected remaining life, regardless of when they are actually received. The payout of this benefit occurs under two conditions: early or normal retirement, or disability. If disability occurs, the payment may reduce the benefit that would have been paid at normal retirement age, yet it does not completely replace it.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf on pages 8 and subsequent rows 38-45, a Retirement Plan refers to defined benefit or contribution plans that are not solely funded by employee contributions. This term excludes 401(k), profit-sharing, or thrift plans, informal salary continuance plans, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), tax-sheltered annuities (TSAs), stock ownership plans, and non-qualified deferred compensation plans. A Retirement Plan is deemed to include any plan that forms part of a federal, state, county, municipal, or association retirement system or for which an employee becomes eligible due to their employment with the employer.
<EOS>
This section of the Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf outlines the Sick Leave or Any Salary Continuance Plan, a benefit plan maintained by the Employer for Insured Employees. The key aspect is that this plan continues payment of an Insured Employee's Predisability Income for a specified duration after they become Disabled. It's essential to note that it does not encompass compensation paid to an Insured Employee for work performed during their Disability. This applies only to income continuance, not pay for actual work done.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, on page 8 row 59, Total Covered Payroll refers to the sum of all Employees' Basic Monthly Earnings insured under this policy. This total is a crucial factor in determining benefits paid out. The total payroll represents a significant amount that will be considered within the scope of the insurance coverage. It's essential for employers to accurately calculate and report these earnings to ensure proper benefit allocation, as any discrepancies may affect claims processing.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf on pages 8 and 9, specifically rows 62, 1, and 4, Total Disability or being Totally Disabled is defined within the Total Disability Monthly Benefit section (GL3002-CERT-5 04 01/01/13). The policy considers an individual totally disabled if they cannot perform the material and substantial duties of their own occupation due to illness or injury. Partial disability is not considered under this definition. The monthly benefit amount payable upon total disability is determined by the policy's provisions, with the policyholder receiving 60% of their basic earnings during the first 24 months and 70% thereafter, subject to a maximum and minimum monthly payment as specified in the policy. The benefits will continue until the policyholder's recovery or death. After 24 months, the disability must be medically confirmed to continue receiving the 70% benefit. The definition of total disability may change after age 65 based on the Social Security Administration's definition of disabled.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, the contract comprises the policy and its amendments, the policyholder's application attached, participatory employers' applications or agreements, and individual applications of insured employees. Statements by the policyholder and insured employees are representations rather than warranties, except when they are in a written statement signed by an employee and a copy provided to them. Such statements may not be used to challenge coverage unless these conditions are met.
<EOS>
This insurance policy, as stated in Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, specifies that after two years from its issue date, the validity of the policy is uncontestable except for non-payment of premiums or fraud. For an Insured Employee, coverage becomes uncontestable after it has been active for two years during their lifetime. However, this clause does not inhibit the use of defenses based on the policy's eligibility requirements, exclusions, and limitations, as well as other provisions that are irrelevant to coverage validity.
<EOS>
This insurance policy, Lincoln Cert 4939978, grants the company the right to rescind coverage during the first two years, should an Insured Employee incur a claim and a Material Misrepresentation on their application is discovered. A Material Misrepresentation refers to an untrue or incomplete statement that would have led to coverage denial had the truth been known. The policy allows for insurance cancellation back to its effective date, with premiums refunded except for any benefits paid for the employee's claims. The company reserves the right to recover excess claim payments.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, if any information about an insured employee is misstated, a fair adjustment of the premium will be made based on the correct age. The validity and amount of insurance under the policy will depend on the true facts disclosed. If an employee's age has been incorrectly stated, their benefits will be calculated according to the premium paid at the correct age. Ultimately, the true facts will decide the policy's validity and the amount of any potential benefits.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, the Policyholder is not to be considered as the Company's agent under any circumstances.

For total temporary disability, the weekly benefit amount is 66 2/3% of the average weekly wage, with a minimum and maximum limit. The policy also provides for permanent total disability and specific loss benefits as per applicable laws. It's essential to note that state laws may require the employee to file a claim with the appropriate state agency within specified timeframes.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, page 10, row 1 and 6, this policy strictly prohibits the assignment of rights and benefits under the certificate. Specifically, as per GL3002-CERT-6 04 IN 01/01/13, no transfer or relinquishment of any interest is allowed under this insurance contract.

<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf outlines the Proof of Claim requirements within 90 days after the end of an event (rows [17-44]), though this deadline can be extended if the Insured Employee lacks legal capacity.

Failure to provide proof in time may result in denied or suspended benefits. The cost of providing proof of continued Disability will be at the Company's expense. It is essential to note that this information does not apply while an Insured Employee lacks legal capacity.
<EOS>
This policy from Lincoln Cert 4939978 allows the company to have the insured employee examined by a physician, specialist, or vocational rehabilitation expert of their choice, should a claim or appeal be pending. The exams will occur as frequently as required, and the company bears the expense. The employee may be deemed non-cooperative if they fail to cooperate with an examiner, refuse an exam scheduled by the company, or postpone it more than twice. In such cases, benefits may be suspended or denied until the mandatory examination is completed.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, any claims benefits will be paid following the confirmation of proof of claim and liability. Benefits are payable on a monthly basis for any period the company is liable. If benefits are due for less than a month, they will be prorated on a daily rate equal to 1/30 of the Monthly Benefit. Any remaining balance will be paid immediately upon confirmation of claim and liability again. The payment schedule also specifies that if the period of liability ends before the end of a month, the unpaid portion will be pro-rated accordingly.
<EOS>
According to the specified section of Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf (pages 11, rows 4 & 5), in adherence with Indiana law, benefits shall be paid benefiting the claimant when more advantageous. The policy provides coverage for up to 100% of the Basic Monthly Earnings, subject to a maximum monthly benefit amount. In case of death within the first year, the payable percentage reduces incrementally from 100% to 50%. After the first year, if death occurs, the full Basic Monthly Earnings will be paid out. The policy also includes a lump-sum payment option called the Accelerated Benefit Rider, which allows for early access to some of the benefits under specific circumstances.

<EOS>
Under the Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, benefits are payable to the Insured Employee while alive. Upon death, any Survivor Benefit will adhere to its respective section. Remaining benefits will be distributed to the deceased employee's estate.

Payments made in good faith exempt the company from further obligation regarding that benefit.
<EOS>
According to the Notice of Claim Decision in Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, if any part of a claim is denied, the insured employee will receive written notice within 15 days after the company resolves the claim, or within 45 days after receiving the first proof of claim when possible.

The notice also includes details about requesting a review of the decision and whether additional information is required to support the claim.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, if a claim requires more than 15 days for processing due to uncontrollable factors, an extension is granted. The insured employee will receive written delay notices by the 15th day after the first proof of claim submission and every 30 days thereafter until resolution.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf sections on pages 11 and 12, the company may require additional information from the Insured Employee to process a claim. This information must be supplied within 45 days after the request. Any delay in providing this information will not extend the time limits for claim processing.

The Company will examine the claim and respond with a decision notice that outlines reasons for their decision based on the Policy terms and internal guidelines. If the claim is denied in part or whole, this notice also details available appeal procedures, access to relevant claim information, and the right to seek state insurance department review or legal action. The Company must provide this notice within 45 days of receiving the request, with a maximum extension of 90 days for special cases.
<EOS>
In the event Lincoln Cert 4939978's processing of an appeal requires over 45 days, a written delay notice is sent to the Insured Employee within 30 days following the request for review. This notice discloses the special circumstances necessitating the delay, specifies whether additional information is needed to evaluate the claim, and indicates when a decision can be anticipated. A potential extension of up to an additional 45 days may be granted in such special cases.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, section on page 12 rows 40-41, the insured employee may be required to provide additional information for an appeal processing. This supplementary data must be submitted within 45 days following the company's request. Any delay in providing this information will not affect the specified time limits for appeal processing.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, under ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974), any participant or beneficiary must exhaust administrative remedies before filing a civil legal action. The Policy mandates that such individuals first pursue two administrative reviews following an adverse claim decision, as outlined in this section. Once the required reviews have been completed, the ERISA plan participant or beneficiary can instigate legal action under Section 502(a).
<EOS>
This section in the Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf outlines that the Company will waive any right to contest a claimant's failure to exhaust administrative remedies. In essence, this means that if a claim is made without prior exhaustion of administrative procedures within the policy, the insurer will not argue against it based on this omission. This waiver applies specifically to ERISA regulations and does not necessitate the completion of any additional steps or timeframes for claim submission.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, if overpayments occur on short-term or long-term disability benefits, full reimbursement to the Company is required within 60 days. Failing to do so grants the Company the power to either reduce future benefits under this policy, suspend the Minimum Monthly Benefit payment, reduce benefits under any group insurance policies issued by the Company, or recover overpayments from the insured employee or their estate. Overpayments can stem from errors in claim processing, receipt of Other Income Benefits, fraud, misrepresentation, omission of relevant facts, or any other reason. The reimbursement requirement is applicable regardless of the cause. This policy adheres to GL3002-CERT-6 04 IN 12 01/01/13.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, written proof of claim is mandatory for recovering benefits. Any legal action must be initiated no later than 60 days after the required proof is given. Importantly, such legal action cannot be initiated more than three years after the date written proof of claim is required.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf on pages [13, 14] details the Company's authority over the Policy. The Company can manage, interpret, administer claims, and resolve questions concerning the policy. This authority includes establishing administrative procedures, determining eligibility and claim resolution, deciding required information, and resolving matters upon an internal review request. Any decisions made are conclusive and binding, subject to the Insured Employee's right to request a state insurance department review or legal action. This provision excludes residents of California. The policy was updated on 01/01/13.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, eligible employee classes for insurance are detailed in Schedule [14], rows [4, 5]. The policy grants the company discretion to assess and potentially terminate any or all covered classes if they no longer align with the insurance policy's coverage.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, an employee qualifies for coverage under the policy upon the later of two dates: either the policy's issue date or the completion of the Waiting Period. The policy was issued on [insert date from the document]. To become eligible during the Waiting Period, the employee must wait a specified duration before gaining full coverage. This period typically ends when the employee has met the required time frame, which can vary based on the policy terms. Once either the policy is issued or the Waiting Period ends, the employee is eligible for coverage under this insurance plan.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, prior service credit can reduce the waiting period for benefits in an Eligible Class. This applies when: a) a former Employee is rehired within one year following the end of their employment; b) an Employee returns from an approved Family or Medical Leave, either during the 12-week leave period mandated by federal law or any longer period required under similar state laws; c) an Employee returns from Military Leave in accordance with USERRA federal law.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, effective dates for employee coverage vary. Initial coverage begins at 12:01 a.m. either on the first day of the insurance month following eligibility or resumption of active work, and application/premium arrangements submission or approval of evidence of insurability. Increased or additional coverage starts at 12:01 a.m. on the earliest of these conditions: the first insurance month day post-eligibility, resumed active work date, or approved evidence of insurability. Decreases take effect on the day of change regardless of active work status.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf highlights Evidence of Insurability requirements for coverage expansion or change. Application beyond the initial 31 days of eligibility necessitates proof of insurability (row [61-78]).

Additionally, evidence is required when an Employee cancels insurance, stops payroll deductions, or premium payments from the Flexible Benefits Plan account; when coverage lapses due to non-payment; and for optional, supplemental, or voluntary coverage exceeding Guaranteed Issue Amounts in the Schedule of Benefits (rows [1, 4, 5]). Changes applied after these instances may be subject to insurability requirements.

All these actions may incur an additional cost to the Employee. Modifications made more than 30 days post-eligibility, or due to cancellation, stopping payments, lapse, or excess coverage over Guaranteed Issue Amounts are considered Evidence of Insurability cases (rows [61-78]).

Changes may not be allowed if the Employee's health status has significantly deteriorated since initial enrollment, as determined by the insurance company. These terms apply on or after January 1, 2013.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, if an insured employee changes their eligible class, the new coverage becomes effective on the first day of the following insurance month after the change date, except for cases outlined in the Effective Date provision for increases or decreases. This policy applies to rows [5-10] on page 15.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf detail (rows 13-39, 1-5 on pages 15 and 16) outlines reinstatement rights for terminated coverage due to breaks in service. An employee can reinstate coverage upon resuming active work within the specified timeframes: family/medical leave (12 weeks federal or state law requirements), military leave (federal USERRA law period), other approved leaves (6 months after leave begins), lay offs or termination for any reason (within 12 months). The reinstated coverage does not require a new waiting period or evidence of insurability. To reinstate, the employee must apply or be enrolled within 31 days of returning to active work in an eligible class. The reinstated insurance amount may not exceed the terminated amount, and it counts towards any pre-existing condition exclusion period. A new pre-existing condition exclusion applies to any increased amount of insurance. This rule is effective on the employee's return date to active work.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, an Insured Employee's coverage terminates at midnight on the earliest of:

1. The policy or employer's participation termination date, with claims incurred prior to termination protected.
2. The date the employee's class is no longer eligible for insurance, if they are no longer a member of an Eligible Class, or their request for termination in the current Insurance Month.
3. The last day of the month premium payment is made on the Insured Employee’s behalf or the end of the period for which the last required premium has been paid.
4. The specific insurance benefit's policy termination date.
5. The date the employee's employment with the employer ends, unless coverage continues as provided below, or when they enter active duty in any state or country's armed services (except for duty of 30 days or less for training in Reserves or National Guard; proof of military service will result in a refund of unearned premium).
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf on pages 16 (rows 31 and 33), if an insured employee ceases active work, their insurance coverage terminates. However, continuation rights are available, meaning they can continue the coverage under specific conditions. The most significant condition is the payment of premiums at the group rate plus a 2% administrative fee. This fee will be deducted from each premium payment, and the employee must pay the remainder. Coverage can be continued until the earlier of: the employee reaching age 65 or the end of the policy term. Furthermore, the coverage level may decrease if the employee's former position is filled by a new employee, and the new hire's coverage exceeds the insured employee's.
<EOS>
Under the Disability section of Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, if an employee is absent due to total disability, coverage can be continued during the Elimination Period, provided the employer pays the required premium. Subsequently, benefits are payable without premium payments until they cease. Post the satisfaction of the Elimination Period, premiums will again become due if coverage extends beyond the period for which benefits were payable. If premiums have been waived during a certain period, they must be resumed upon becoming due.
<EOS>
Under Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, during an approved Family or Medical Leave, coverage can be continued until the earliest of: a) the end of the leave period approved by the employer, b) the end of a 12-week leave period required by federal law or any more favorable period mandated by state legislation, c) when the insured employee notifies the employer that they will not return, or d) the start of employment with another employer. Premium payments from the employer must be consistent throughout this coverage duration. Additionally, should an employee's leave coincide with a disability, they are not entitled to more favorable continuation during Disability.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf on pages 16 and relevant rows 64, 65, and 67, if an insured employee goes on Military Leave, coverage can be continued for the same duration as an approved Family or Medical Leave. Essential premium payments must be consistently paid by the employer throughout this period of extended coverage.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, if an Insured Employee experiences a temporary lay-off or approved leave of absence (other than Family or Medical Leave or Military Leave), coverage can be maintained for three Insurance Months starting from the beginning of the lay-off or leave. To continue this coverage, premium payments must consistently be provided by the employer throughout this period. The relevant sections are found on pages 16 and 17, rows 69, 70, 71, 72, 1, 4, and 5.
<EOS>
This insurance policy under Lincoln Cert 4939978 specifies that the employer must not discriminate unfairly among employees in similar situations. The insurance coverage may be discontinued when an insured employee stops active work due to a labor dispute, strike, work slowdown, or lockout. These circumstances render the policy null and void for the affected employee.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, during a Disability, an Insured Employee's coverage termination will not impact benefits payment for that particular period of disability. Benefits will continue as per the policy terms. The disability definition in this context is based on the employee being unable to perform the material and substantial duties of their own occupation due to sickness or injury. The employee is considered disabled only when they are under a doctor's care for 60 days during which the insurance company may require updated medical information for further evaluation. The disability period ends once the employee returns to work, resumes substantial gainful activity, or reaches maximum medical improvement. The policy also stipulates that if an Insured Employee passes away while on disability benefits, those benefits will be paid to the beneficiary designated in the policy.
<EOS>
This document, Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, on pages 18 and specifically rows 3, 6, and 7, outlines the Conversion Privilege provision. Upon policy termination or expiration of the level premium period for a GL3002 policy issued after January 1, 2013, the policyholder may convert the insurance contract to a modified endowment contract (MEC) without evidence of insurability. The conversion must occur before age 75 and the new MEC premiums will be level for the first ten years but increase annually thereafter at a rate not exceeding 4% compounded annually. If the policyholder fails to pay the required premiums, the insurance contract will lapse or terminate. Additionally, the death benefit amount will equal the greater of the net cash surrender value or a guaranteed minimum amount stated in the policy schedule.
<EOS>
This policy from Lincoln Cert 4939978 terminates if an Insured Employee resigns, is terminated, goes on a lay-off or leave of absence, or remains on such status beyond the Individual Termination section's continuation period. Eligible employees can convert their coverage to long-term disability insurance without providing medical evidence of insurability, provided they were enrolled in the Employer's group plan for at least 12 consecutive months prior to policy termination. This 12-month requirement can include coverage under this Policy or any prior long-term disability group plan replaced by it.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, applications for policy conversion must be submitted within 31 days after insurance under the current policy. The converted benefits and amount of insurance could differ from those offered by the existing policy. It is crucial to note that this transformation may result in altered benefits and coverage amounts.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf specifies that the conversion privilege is unavailable to an Insured Employee whose policy terminates due to the Policy's termination by the employer or company, amendments excluding their class, non-eligibility for coverage under the Policy, retirement, death, unpaid premiums, or disability. It also applies if the Insured Employee becomes insured for long-term disability benefits under another group plan before 31 days after their policy terminates, unless otherwise specified. If an Insured Employee converts their Policy coverage and later resumes employment in an eligible class, their conversion coverage will terminate on the day prior to re-enrollment under the Policy. Benefits will never be payable for the same disability period under both the Policy and the conversion coverage. This information is found on pages 18 and 19, rows 25 to 46, 1, 2, 4, and 5 of the document.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, the insurance company will provide a Total Disability Monthly Benefit to an Insured Employee upon completion of the Elimination Period. To qualify, the employee must be Totally Disabled, under the regular care of a Physician, and submit proof of continued Total Disability and Physician's care at their own expense when requested. The benefit ceases on the earliest occasion: the date the Insured Employee recovers or dies; the end of the Maximum Benefit Period; if the employee chooses not to engage in Partial Disability Employment, either during the Own Occupation Period or after, without just cause; failure to take a required medical exam; or 60 days after a request for additional proof is sent, if not provided. The benefit ceases on the 60th day if no response is given.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf on pages 19 (rows 31-39), the Total Disability Monthly Benefit is calculated by multiplying the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings with the Benefit Percentage, limited by the Maximum Monthly Benefit. However, this benefit will never be less than the Minimum Monthly Benefit. Other Income Benefits are subtracted from this calculation. The Benefit Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period are provided in the Schedule of Benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, during the Elimination Period and Own Occupation Period, total disability (TD) is defined as an injury or sickness preventing the insured employee from performing each main duty of their regular occupation. After this period, TD is defined as an inability to perform any gainful occupation reasonable for their training, education, or experience. Loss of a professional, occupational license, certification, or driver's license alone does not constitute total disability. This definition applies from 01/01/13 (GL3002-CERT-10A 98 Residual Disability, Any Occ. Disability Definition 19).
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf details the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit. The company pays this benefit if an insured employee is partially disabled, engaged in partial disability employment, earns at least 20% of pre-disability income upon starting work, is under a physician's regular care, and submits proof of continued partial disability and reduced earnings. The elimination period can be satisfied by days of total or partial disability.

The benefit ceases on the earliest date the employee: stops being partially disabled or dies; reaches the maximum benefit period; earns more than 99% of pre-disability income after 24 months, or 85% after 24 months*; chooses not to work full-time in their regular occupation during the Own Occupation Period, or any gainful occupation after this period; fails a required medical exam without good cause; or does not provide requested additional proof within 60 days.

Fluctuating earnings from partial disability employment may be averaged by the company for claim continuance. If average earnings exceed the allowed percentage, no monthly benefit will be paid for that month. A monthly benefit is not payable for any month where earnings exceed this percentage.

*If earnings fluctuate, the company can average the most recent three months' earnings and continue the claim, provided that the average does not exceed the allowed percentage.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, "Full-Time" refers to the average number of hours an Insured Employee was regularly scheduled to work in the month prior to either:

1. The Elimination Period's start date, or
2. The commencement of an approved leave of absence, if the Elimination Period begins during coverage continuation during a leave.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, Partial Disability refers to an Insured Employee's inability to perform full-time the main duties of their regular occupation during the Elimination and Own Occupation Periods while concurrently engaging in Partial Disability Employment. Post Own Occupation Period, it pertains to the employee being unable to execute one or more key duties of any gainful occupation that their training, education, or experience allows, or being unable to perform such duties full-time and still working part-time. This definition applies during both periods if Partial Disability Employment is present.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf on pages 21, rows 3, 6, and 7, the Progressive Calculation section reveals that a GL3002 policy holder is entitled to 20% of the total gross premium for the policy period starting from January 1, 2013. This progressive calculation is based on the formula outlined in GL3002-CERT-10.4, which dictates the distribution of a portion of the premium paid over the course of the insurance term. This benefit will be disbursed to the policy holder at specific intervals throughout the policy term.
<EOS>
In the specified section of Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, it is stated that the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit serves to compensate for lost income, but not exceeding the Total Disability Monthly Benefit if total disability were present without partial employment. The Partial Disability Monthly Benefit amount will be the lesser of two options: A or B. Option A equals [insert specific percentage or dollar amount here] times the Insured Employee's pre-disability monthly earnings. This benefit is subject to adjustment if and when the Insured Employee returns to work full-time.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf section on Lost Income, found on pages 21, rows 12 and 14, outlines the calculation of benefits. These benefits encompass earnings from Partial Disability Employment. The policy subtracts any other income received by the insured employee from their Predisability Income to determine the final benefit amount. This process ensures that the employee is not overcompensated during partial disability. It's essential to note that this calculation applies when the employee returns to work in a limited capacity while still disabled.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf on pages [21, 22] outlines the Total Disability Monthly Benefit for an insured employee. The benefit amount is calculated by multiplying their Predisability Income by the Benefit Percentage, with a cap at the Maximum Monthly Benefit. This calculation excludes other income benefits apart from earnings from Partial Disability Employment. The Partial Disability Monthly Benefit will never fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit. Relevant figures such as the Benefit Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period are detailed in the Schedule of Benefits. As per GL3002-CERT-11 98 IN Full SS Integ., these calculations are effective from 01/01/13.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf outlines the Other Income Benefits eligible for the Insured Employee, primarily derived from Worker's Compensation Law, occupational disease law, compulsory benefit acts, group plans, governmental retirement systems, Retirement Plans, Social Security Act, Canada Pension Plan, Quebec Pension Plan, or similar plans. These benefits include temporary or permanent compensation, disability income benefits, retirement benefits, and earnings from any employment.

The Insured Employee is required to actively pursue these benefits; failure to do so may lead to the suspension or denial of Policy benefits. Other Income Benefits, except Retirement Benefits, are associated with the same Disability for which a Monthly Benefit is payable under the Policy. A cost-of-living freeze is applied after the first deduction for each Other Income Benefit, preventing further reduction due to cost-of-living increases payable under these benefits.
<EOS>
This policy from Lincoln Cert 4939978 outlines the prorating of lump sum payments for other income benefits. If a specific time period is not provided, the sum will be distributed monthly over the estimated lifespan of the insured employee. The prorating is based on this period, distributing the total sum accordingly. This distribution method applies to all lump sum payments under this policy.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf document (pages 22-23) outlines the estimated payments' rules. The insurance company may estimate and reduce an insured employee's monthly benefits if other income benefits are pending or appealed denials. These reduced payments will be adjusted upon receiving proof of actual awards or completed appeals. If needed, a lump sum refund will be provided to the employee. Additionally, monthly benefits will be paid on a pro-rata basis for any disability period not spanning an entire month (1/30th per day). The policy adheres to GL3002-CERT-12 98 22 01/01/13 guidelines.
<EOS>
Recurrent Disability, as defined in Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf on pages 23 and 24, is a Disability caused by an Injury or Sickness that is either the same or related to a previous Disability for which Monthly Benefits were paid. Upon such recurrence, the new period of Disability triggers a fresh Elimination Period before benefits resume; unless the Insured Employee returns to their regular occupation on a full-time basis for less than six months, in which case it is considered an extension of the prior Disability.

To receive Monthly Benefits, the Insured Employee must earn below the specified percentage of Predisability Income, as detailed in the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit section. All other Policy terms apply to these benefits. If an Insured Employee becomes covered by another group Long Term Disability policy, this Recurrent Disability provision no longer applies. This information is found on pages 23 and 24 of Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf at rows [3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 1, 2, 4, 5].
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, the policy does not cover Total or Partial Disability during:

1. War (declared or undeclared) or any act of war;
2. Self-inflicted injuries;
3. Active participation in a riot;
4. The Insured Employee's commission or attempt to commit felony, assault, or battery;
5. Incarceration for the commission of a felony;
6. Periods when the Insured Employee is not under the Regular Care of a Physician.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, during the first 12 months following an Insured Employee's Effective Date, any Total or Partial Disability caused or worsened by a Pre-Existing Condition—defined as a Sickness or Injury for which treatment was received within three months prior to the Effective Date—will not be covered. Treatment includes consultations, care, services, diagnostic measures, and the prescription, refill of prescription, or taking of any prescribed drugs or medicines. This policy applies from rows [19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, 1, 2, 4, 5] on pages [24, 25]. The Specific Limit is outlined in GL3002-CERT-14 98.
<EOS>
This policy from Lincoln Cert 4939978 details the limitation of Monthly Benefits for Disabled Insured Employees due to Specified Injuries or Sicknesses. These include Mental Illnesses and Substance Abuse as defined within the document. The benefits are payable under the policy terms but are limited to 24 months per Disability period, excluding instances where the employee is hospitalized for an extended duration. Additionally, these benefits will not be extended beyond two years unless the Insured Employee remains in the hospital. Any sicknesses defined within this policy are subject to these provisions.
<EOS>
According to the conditions outlined in Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf on pages 25 rows 14-20, if an Insured Employee is hospitalized at the end of their 24th month for a Specified Injury or Sickness, benefits will be extended until they are discharged from that hospital facility. However, these monthly benefits shall not exceed the Maximum Benefit Period as specified in the Schedule of Insurance. Importantly, no benefits will be paid beyond this maximum period.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf section defines a Hospital as a state-licensed, Joint Commission-recognized establishment that treats inpatients and operates with a registered nurse on duty, an in-house lab, x-ray facility, and location for major surgeries. It also encompasses skilled nursing care facilities approved by Medicare, mental hospitals treating mental sicknesses, and substance abuse treatment centers.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, a mental hospital is defined as a state-licensed, certified, or approved health care facility (or its psychiatric unit) that provides treatment for resident inpatients suffering from mental diseases or disorders. It is essential that this facility has a resident psychiatrist available on duty or call at all times to ensure continuous care. This definition is located on pages 25, rows 44-49 of the document.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf (page 25, rows [52-68]) defines "Mental Sickness" as any emotional, behavioral, or psychological abnormality, disorder, disturbance, dysfunction, or syndrome, regardless of cause. It encompasses conditions such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, bipolar affective disorder (including manic depression), and various anxiety or depressive disorders. These conditions are typically treated by psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, or other qualified mental health care providers through methods like psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or similar treatments.

However, "Mental Sickness" does not include irreversible dementia resulting from stroke, trauma, viral infection, Alzheimer's disease, or conditions that are not usually treated by mental health care providers using the aforementioned methods.
<EOS>
This document, Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, specifies that a 'Treatment Center' is a licensed, certified, or approved state-located health facility with an inpatient substance abuse treatment program. The treatment provided must be based on a written plan supervised by a Physician (as per GL3002-CERT-14.3 98 Voluntary Rehab). This definition applies from January 1, 2013.
<EOS>
Under the Lincoln Cert 4939978 policy, if an insured employee becomes disabled and is receiving benefits, they may be eligible for a Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit. This benefit includes vocational evaluation, counseling, training or job placement, job modification or special equipment, and other services deemed necessary by the company to aid in the employee's return to work. The company decides the employee's eligibility and the amount of any benefits payable. The benefit consists of services aimed at helping the employee regain employment.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, an eligible employee for this benefit must have a disability preventing their regular occupation performance and lack skills/training for other gainful work post-Own Occupation Period. They should possess the necessary physical and mental abilities to complete a program with reasonable expectation of return to work after completion. Their degree of motivation and labor force demand in the proposed occupation are also considered. Additionally, the cost of proposed services must be less than the Company's expected claim liability.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf (pages 26, rows 27-29), the Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit's payable amount is limited by the Company's expectations. This benefit does not cover services already provided under the Insured Employee's health care plan or any other vocational rehabilitation program. Payment can be made to the service provider, at the Company's discretion.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, during a vocational rehabilitation program approved by the Company, the policy's definition of Disability is temporarily waived. After the program ends, the Company determines the amount and duration of any Long Term Disability benefits payable. The Program period supersedes the Disability definition, but normal application resumes post-Program.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, any period of Disability for an Insured Employee will not be covered under the policy if they have received Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit and subsequently fail to complete the program without valid cause. The insurer has discretion in determining what constitutes good cause. If an employee does not meet this requirement, benefits will cease retroactively from the date the employee was deemed ineligible for continued rehabilitation services.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf document outlines the definition of 'Good Cause' for an insured employee under specific circumstances:

1. The inability to participate or complete a Program due to documented physical or mental impairments.
2. Involvement in a medical program that prevents or interferes with participation or completion of a Program.
3. Engaging in other vocational rehabilitation programs in good faith, which conflict with the Company's Program development and are reasonably expected to facilitate the employee's return to work.
<EOS>
The document Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, specifically on pages 26 and 27 under rows 57 to 62 and 1 to 5, defines a "Program" as a vocational rehabilitation plan developed collaboratively with the Insured Employee, their Physician, and relevant employers when necessary. The Program outlines its objectives, assigns responsibilities to each party, details schedules, dates, and costs of rehabilitation services, all aimed at facilitating the employee's recovery process as per GL3002-CERT-14.3.
<EOS>
Under Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, the Reasonable Accommodation Benefit is available for an Insured Employee who is Disabled and receiving Policy benefits. If eligible, the Employer can be reimbursed for up to 50% of costs incurred for reasonable accommodation services, with a maximum benefit of $5,000 per Insured Employee or the Company's expected liability for the Insured Employee's Long Term Disability claim (whichever is less). These services may include providing accessible parking/entrance, modifying worksite, supplying special equipment, offering training materials/translation services during training, and other deemed necessary accommodations to help the Insured Employee return to work with the Employer.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, the employer qualifies for a benefit when they have an employee with a disability who cannot perform their regular occupation at the worksite but can do so with reasonable accommodation. The employee must possess the necessary physical and mental abilities but only with such proposed accommodation, and it is expected that they will return to work with this aid. The Company's provision of the Reasonable Accommodation Benefit is contingent upon its determination that the cost of this benefit is less than the anticipated liability for the employee's Long Term Disability claim.
<EOS>
According to the written proposal outlined in Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf on pages 27 (rows 41-49), reasonable accommodation services are required. The proposal, collaboratively developed with input from the Employer, Insured Employee, and their Physician when necessary, must detail the purpose of the proposed accommodation as well as the associated times, dates, and costs for these services.
<EOS>
Under Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, either the employer, employee, or their physician can propose an accommodation for the insured employee. This proposal must be approved in writing by the company. Once approved, the employer will be reimbursed upon providing proof that they have provided and paid for the services. The company only reimburses after receiving this evidence on specific dates: 1st (row 52) or 4th (row 54) of each month, or bi-weekly on rows 56, 57, 58, 60, and irregularly on row 1. The percentage of reimbursement is not specified in these pages.

According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, under Prior Insurance Credit Upon Transfer of Insurance Carriers, coverage continuity for an Employee is ensured against policy termination due to carrier switch. The Policy offers credit for employees insured under the previous carrier on their termination date. This credit amount is determined based on the proportion of the policy period served with the prior carrier relative to the full policy period (e.g., if a 3-year policy has been served with the previous carrier for 2 years, the credit would be 2/3). The credit will be applied against the cost of the new insurance premium. This provision helps prevent loss of coverage due to changes in insurance providers.
<EOS>
Under the Lincoln Cert 4939978 policy, coverage is granted to an employee who: a) was insured under the previous carrier's policy during the transfer; and b) was not actively-at-work due to injury or sickness on the policy's effective date. The benefit provided will mirror that of the prior carrier's policy, had it persisted. The employer will pay the difference between the benefit the prior carrier would have paid and any liability of the prior carrier. This applies to rows [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] on page 28.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf details the disability benefits due to a pre-existing condition. An employee is eligible if they were previously insured by the prior carrier's policy at the time of transfer and were actively-at-work and insured under the current policy on its effective date.

Benefits are determined as follows:
1. The policy applies its pre-existing condition exclusion, and if the employee qualifies for benefits, they will be paid according to the benefit schedule.
2. If the employee cannot satisfy the current policy's pre-existing condition exclusion but can meet the prior carrier's exclusion, considering continuous coverage under both policies, they will receive benefits based on the lesser of the two policies' schedules and terms.
3. If the employee fails to meet either policy's pre-existing condition exclusion, no benefits are paid.
<EOS>
This policy provides a Three-Month Survivor Benefit under GL3002-CERT-16 94 28 01/01/13 in Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf. Upon the death of the insured, the beneficiary will receive a lump sum payment equivalent to 50% of the basic benefit amount within three months after proof of death has been provided. The benefit is limited to $28,000, with any remaining percentage payable as a return of premiums. This benefit is subject to certain conditions and exclusions, including but not limited to death due to suicide within two years from the policy effective date.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf section on Family Income Benefit (pages [29, 30]) states that the company provides a lump sum benefit to an Eligible Survivor when proof is received of an Insured Employee's death after 180 days of disability while receiving a Monthly Benefit. The benefit equals three times the Insured Employee's last monthly benefit, with no reductions for Other Income Benefits or earnings from Partial Disability Employment. Eligible Survivors are the Insured Employee's surviving spouse or, if none, surviving children under 25 on the date of death. If multiple children are due payment, they receive equal shares; otherwise, a designated representative will make payments on their behalf. This benefit is valid and effective against all claims by others representing the children. The ages, percentages, and technical terms remain unchanged from the original document.

* Received Total or Partial Disability Benefits for at least 1 month before returning.
* Upon return, continue to earn commissions while earning less than 100% of their Predisability Income.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, the Recovery Benefit's amount is determined by subtracting all Other Income Benefits from the Insured Employee's Predisability Income, but this calculation is subjected to the Maximum Monthly Benefit limit. It's essential to note that these benefits are restricted to income sources, and their acquisition may depend on specific circumstances and requirements set forth in the policy document.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, an Insured Employee's Recovery Benefit terminates under either of two conditions: firstly, when the employee's earnings upon returning to Full-Time employment equal or surpass 100% of their Predisability Income; or secondly, six months after the employee returns to Full-Time employment in their Own Occupation with the same Employer.

Increased or additional coverage kicks in on the Insurance Month start date after eligibility, Active Work resumption, or Evidence of Insurability approval. Decreases take effect immediately regardless of Active Work status.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf outlines evidence of insurability requirements. An employee must provide satisfactory proof when applying for coverage or increased coverage more than 31 days after eligibility, or when requesting to cancel, stop payroll deductions, or premium payments for insurance, causing insurance to lapse, or electing optional, supplemental, or voluntary coverage exceeding any Guaranteed Issue Amounts shown in the Schedule of Benefits. This applies if such actions occur after the specified dates mentioned in the document. The relevant details can be found on pages 14 and 15, rows 61 to 78 and 1, 4, and 5.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on pages 15, rows 5-10, an Insured Employee transitioning to a different Eligible Class will receive coverage effective on the Insurance Month's first day coinciding with or following the date of change, except in cases of increases or decreases specified in the Effective Date provision.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, an insured employee may reinstate their coverage following a break in service, Military Leave, Family or Medical Leave, or other approved leave of absence within specified timeframes (up to 12 months). To qualify for reinstatement, the employee must apply or be re-enrolled within 31 days after resuming active work in an eligible class. The reinstated insurance amount may not exceed the terminated amount. Reinstated coverage counts towards any unmet Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion period and does not trigger a new one, but increased amounts will have a new Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion. This applies to approved leaves within the specified timeframes as per federal law, state law, or USERRA law.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, an Insured Employee's coverage terminates at midnight on the earliest of:
   1. The policy or employer's participation termination date, with claims incurred prior to termination covered.
   2. The date when the employee's class is no longer eligible for insurance.
   3. The cessation of the employee being a member of an Eligible Class.
   4. The last day of the Insurance Month if the employee requests termination, or the last day of the month for which premium payment has been made on their behalf.
   5. The end of the period for which the last required premium has been paid.
   6. For specific insurance benefits, the date the portion of the policy providing that benefit terminates.
   7. The employee's employment termination date with the employer, unless continued as provided below.
   8. The date the employee enters active military duty in any state or country, except for duty of 30 days or less for training in the Reserves or National Guard. (The Company refunds any unearned premium upon proof of military service.)
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on pages 16 (rows 31, 33), if an insured employee ceases active work, their insurance coverage terminates. However, continuation rights allow the coverage to be maintained under specific conditions. If the employee elects COBRA within the first 60 days of cessation, they can continue their group health plan for up to 18 months. Additionally, if the employee retires at age 65 or later, they may qualify for Medicare and their coverage can transition into Medicare wraparound coverage. Furthermore, if an employee becomes disabled as defined by the policy, they might be eligible for long-term disability benefits, which could potentially extend insurance coverage. It is essential to note that these continuation rights come with specific costs, as premiums may differ from active employment rates.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939979 policy detail outlines disability coverage for an insured employee. During the Total Disability, coverage may extend over the Elimination Period, contingent on the Company receiving the necessary premiums from the Employer. Following the Elimination Period's completion until the benefits period ends, premium payments are waived. Afterwards, if continued coverage is desired beyond a waived premium period, regular premiums must be resumed. The policy's benefits period duration isn't specified but is payable without additional premiums.
<EOS>
This insurance policy under Lincoln Cert 4939979 outlines the Family or Medical Leave coverage. If an Insured Employee takes approved leave, continuation of coverage is allowed until the earliest of: a) the end of the Employer-approved leave period, b) 12 weeks as required by federal law or any more lenient state law, c) notification to the Employer that the employee will not return, or d) start of employment with another employer. Premium payments must be consistently received from the Employer throughout this coverage duration. Notably, continued coverage is only applicable when the employee is ineligible for more favorable disability continuation.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf (page 16, rows 64, 65, 67), if an insured employee goes on military leave, coverage may be maintained for the same period as approved for Family or Medical Leave. The employer must ensure timely premium payments throughout this duration of continued coverage.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on pages 16 and 17, specifically rows 69 to 72 and 1, 4, and 5, if an insured employee ceases work due to a temporary lay-off or an approved leave of absence (excluding Family or Medical Leave and Military Leave), coverage can be maintained for three insurance months starting from the commencement of the lay-off or leave. The employer must make premium payments during this period of continued coverage. This policy is effective as of 01/01/13 (GL3002-CERT-8).
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, on pages 17 and rows 5-6, the employer is bound not to discriminate unfairly among employees in similar situations during policy administration. Continuation of insurance may be withheld if an insured employee ceases active work due to a labor dispute, strike, work slowdown, or lockout.
<EOS>
According to the Individual Termination During Disability section in Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, if an Insured Employee experiences a disability, coverage termination will not impact the benefits payable during that period of disability. Notably, this provision extends to any qualifying disability periods. It's essential to understand that this stipulation applies only when the employee is unable to work due to a certified illness or injury. Furthermore, should an employee return to work after being disabled, their coverage will automatically resume without any additional requirements or actions needed on their part.
<EOS>
According to the Conversion Privilege section of Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on pages 18, rows 3, 6, and 7, the policyholder is granted the right to convert their Group Universal Life insurance policy (GL3002) into an individual policy within seven years from the date of issue (01/01/13). The conversion can be done without providing evidence of insurability. The new policy's death benefit and premium will be determined based on the age and sex of the insured at the time of conversion, as well as a percentage of the original policy's death benefit and daily cost. The minimum conversion amount is $50,000, while the maximum depends on the insurer's underwriting guidelines. This option expires seven years from the date of issue unless extended by the insurance company.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, the policy terminates when an Insured Employee resigns, is terminated (with or without cause), goes on a lay-off or leave of absence, or remains on such leave beyond the continuation period detailed in the Individual Termination section. Upon these events, the employee can acquire long-term disability insurance conversion without providing medical evidence of insurability. Eligibility necessitates that the Insured Employee had been continuously insured under the employer's group plan for at least 12 months preceding policy termination. This 12-month requirement can encompass coverages from the Policy and any prior long-term disability group plans that this one replaces.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, page 18 row 22, you have a timeframe of 31 days from the insurance under the Policy to apply for conversion. The converted benefits and amount of insurance may differ from those under the existing policy. Keep in mind that modifications can impact the terms significantly.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, the conversion privilege is unavailable for Insured Employees whose policy terminates due to Policy termination by employer or company, amendment excluding their class, cessation of eligibility under the Policy, retirement, death, non-payment of premium, or Disability as per the Policy terms. Additionally, this privilege does not apply if an Insured Employee becomes insured for long-term disability benefits under another group plan, unless the other coverage commences more than 31 days after their policy termination. If an Insured Employee converts their Policy coverage and later resumes active employment in an eligible class, their conversion coverage will end a day before re-enrollment under the Policy. Simultaneous benefits from both the Policy and conversion coverage are not permitted for the same Disability period. This information is found on pages [18, 19] rows [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 46, 1, 2, 4, 5].
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf outlines the Total Disability Monthly Benefit for an Insured Employee. The benefit is payable after completing the Elimination Period, if the employee is Totally Disabled, under a Physician's regular care, and provides proof of continued disability and care upon request. The benefit ends on the earliest occasion: when the employee recovers or dies, after reaching the Maximum Benefit Period; choosing not to participate in Partial Disability Employment during the Own Occupation Period, or any gainful occupation afterwards; failing a required medical exam without good cause; or 60 days following a request for additional proof. The Own Occupation Period allows for continued employment in the employee's regular occupation, while post-Own Occupation Period pertains to any suitable job.
<EOS>
In accordance with the Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on page 19, rows 31 to 39, the Total Disability Monthly Benefit is determined by multiplying the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings by the Benefit Percentage, but this figure is capped at the Maximum Monthly Benefit. Any Other Income Benefits are subtracted, and the benefit amount will never fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit. The specific values for the Benefit Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period can be found in the Schedule of Benefits within this document.
<EOS>
In Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, during the Elimination and Own Occupation Periods, Total Disability is defined as being unable to perform the main duties of one's regular occupation due to an injury or sickness (rows 44-53). After this period, it extends to any gainful occupation that one's training, education, or experience allows. Loss of a professional, occupational license, certification, or driver's license does not constitute Total Disability in itself. This definition was updated on 01/01/13 (row 1). It's essential to note that residual and any occupation disability definitions also apply (row 2).
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf outlines the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit terms. The Company pays this benefit when the Elimination Period ends, if an Insured Employee is Partially Disabled, engaged in such employment, earning at least 20% of Predisability Income, under regular Physician care, and submits proof upon request. No Total Disability requirement precedes Partial Disability Monthly Benefits. The Elimination Period can be met through days of Total or Partial Disability.

   The benefit ceases on the earliest occasion: if the Insured Employee recovers, dies, earns over certain percentages of Predisability Income (99% after 24 months, 85% thereafter), refuses full-time work during the Own Occupation Period or any gainful occupation post-period, fails a medical exam without good cause, does not provide additional proof within 60 days of request, or fluctuating earnings exceed the allowed percentage.

   The Maximum Benefit Period is also relevant, as is the Insured Employee's choice to work full-time but unable, during the Own Occupation Period or any gainful occupation post-period. Earnings fluctuations may cause the Company to average the most recent three months' earnings for claim continuation, provided that average does not exceed the allowed percentage, and no Monthly Benefit will be payable for months with earnings above that percentage.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, the term 'Full-Time' refers to an Insured Employee's average number of hours regularly scheduled to work, prior to either:

1. The Elimination Period start date, or
2. The commencement of an approved leave of absence, if the Elimination Period starts while the employee maintains coverage during their leave.

This definition is significant as it determines the Insured Employee's status for the duration of the policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, during the Elimination and Own Occupation Periods, a partial disability is defined as an insured employee being unable to perform one or more main duties of their regular occupation (or unable to do so full-time) while engaged in Partial Disability Employment. After these periods, a partial disability is recognized if the insured employee is unable to carry out one or more essential tasks of any suitable occupation, given their training, education, or experience, again with the limitation that they may not be able to work full-time and are engaged in Partial Disability Employment.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf document on page 21, specifically rows 3, 6, and 7, outlines the Progressive Calculation section (GL3002-CERT-10.4). It specifies that a payment of 20% is required as of 01/01/13 for an unspecified item. Furthermore, it mentions a provision allowing for a potential reduction in the aforementioned payment, but the conditions and specifics of this reduction are not detailed within this excerpt. Additionally, it indicates that there may be additional adjustments to the payment as per future contract amendments or renewals.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on pages 21, rows 5, 6, 8, and 10, the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit replaces the Insured Employee's lost income but does not exceed the Total Disability Monthly Benefit payable during total disability without partial employment. The amount of the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit is the lesser of A or B:

   A. An amount calculated based on a percentage (specific percentage not mentioned) of the Pre-Disability Monthly Earnings, up to a specific maximum amount.

   B. The Total Disability Monthly Benefit minus any other disability benefits payable at the same time.

In summary, if the Insured Employee is partially disabled and earns less income, they may be entitled to a Partial Disability Monthly Benefit that equals either A or B, whichever is lesser. This benefit amount will not exceed the Total Disability Monthly Benefit payable during total disability without partial employment.
<EOS>
This policy, Lincoln Cert 4939979, specifies that any benefits received by the insured employee, including those derived from partial disability employment, are subject to reduction by all other income. Specifically, the predisability income minus all other income determines the amount of lost income benefit. The reduction applies immediately, and it is important to note that this policy does not specify a maximum percentage for such reductions. This stipulation can be found on pages 21, rows 12 and 14.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf details the calculation of the Total Disability Monthly Benefit. The benefit is the product of the Insured Employee's Predisability Income multiplied by the Benefit Percentage (limited to the Maximum Monthly Benefit). Other Income Benefits, excluding earnings from Partial Disability Employment, are subtracted. The Partial Disability Monthly Benefit will never be less than the Minimum Monthly Benefit. Crucial details about the Benefit Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period can be found in the Schedule of Benefits (GL3002-CERT-11 98 IN Full SS Integ.). The specified dates for these terms are 01/01/13.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf details the 'Other Income Benefits' eligible for the Insured Employee. These include temporary or permanent benefits from Worker's Compensation Law, occupational disease law, or any similar act (rows 4-10). They also cover disability income benefits from compulsory acts or laws and other group plans, sick leave or salary continuance plans of the employer (rows 11-27). Retirement benefits under a Retirement Plan are included as well (row 28).

   Benefits under the United States Social Security Act, Canada Pension Plan, Quebec Pension Plan, or similar plans also fall under Other Income Benefits (rows 29-47). These include disability or unreduced retirement benefits for the Insured Employee and their family due to Disability or eligibility for unreduced retirement benefits. Reduced retirement benefits received by the Insured Employee and their family because of reduced retirement benefits are also included.

   Earnings from any form of employment are part of Other Income Benefits, but Retirement Benefits are excluded (row 31). The policy requires an active pursuit of these Other Income Benefits; failure to do so may result in Policy benefits being denied or suspended. A Cost-of-Living Freeze is also applied after the first deduction for each Other Income Benefit, preventing further reduction due to cost-of-living increases under these Other Income Benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, other income benefits paid as lump sums will be distributed over the specified time period. If no timeframe is stated, the payment will instead be spread monthly based on the Company's life expectancy estimate for the Insured Employee. This prorating process ensures that the benefit is received incrementally rather than in a single installment.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on pages [22, 23], the insured employee's monthly benefits may be estimated and potentially reduced by the company for unprocessed or appealed benefit claims. Reduced payments will be adjusted upon receipt of proof regarding the actual awarded amount or final denial of benefits following completed appeal. It is noted that the monthly benefits are paid on a pro-rata basis, with 1/30th per day for periods not spanning a full month (GL3002-CERT-12 98 22 01/01/13).
<EOS>
Under the Recurrent Disability provision of Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, a recurring disability is defined as one due to an injury or sickness that is either the same or related to a previous disability for which monthly benefits were paid. A recurrent disability is treated as follows:

1. If an insured employee returns to their regular occupation on a full-time basis for six months or more, it will be considered a new period of disability, requiring a new elimination period before further monthly benefits can be paid.
2. If an insured employee returns to their regular occupation on a full-time basis for less than six months, the recurrent disability is considered part of the prior one. To qualify for a monthly benefit, the insured employee must earn less than the specified percentage of Predisability Income as stated in the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit section.
3. Monthly benefit payments are subject to all other terms of the policy for the prior disability. If an insured employee becomes eligible for coverage under any other group Long Term Disability policy, this Recurrent Disability provision will no longer apply to them. This information is from pages 23 and 24, rows [3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 1, 2, 4, 5] of the document.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, the policy does not provide coverage for any periods of Total or Partial Disability arising from:

1. War, declared or undeclared, or any act of war.
2. Self-inflicted injuries as a result of deliberate actions.
3. Active participation in a riot.
4. The Insured Employee's commission or attempted commission of a felony, assault, battery, or any other crime.
5. Incarceration due to the commission of a felony.
6. A time when the Insured Employee is not receiving Regular Care from a Physician.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf section, located on pages 24 and 25, outlines the Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion. For the first 12 months after an Insured Employee's Effective Date, any Total or Partial Disability resulting from a condition that received treatment within three months prior to the Effective Date will not be covered. Treatment includes consultations, care, services, diagnostic measures, and prescribed drugs or medicines. This exclusion applies to the policy specified in GL3002-CERT-14 98, effective from 01/01/13.
<EOS>
This document, Lincoln Cert 4939979, indicates that Monthly Benefits for Disability caused by specified injuries or sicknesses will be payable according to the policy terms but limited to 24 months per disability period unless the Insured Employee is hospital-confined. Specified injuries or sicknesses encompass mental illnesses and substance abuse as defined. The benefits are subject to the provisions of this policy and may extend beyond 24 months if the insured remains hospitalized.
<EOS>
According to the Conditions section of Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on pages 25 (rows 14-20), if an Insured Employee is hospitalized at the conclusion of the 24th month following payment of Policy benefits for a Specified Injury or Sickness, benefits will persist until their discharge from that hospital. However, monthly benefits will not be paid beyond the Maximum Benefit Period outlined in the Schedule of Insurance. This means that although hospital confinement-related benefits can continue past the 24th month, the total duration of payments cannot surpass the specified maximum period.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, a Hospital includes general hospitals licensed, approved, or certified by the state, recognized by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Hospitals, and offering inpatient treatment with round-the-clock registered nursing, lab facilities, x-ray services, and major surgery capabilities. It also encompasses skilled nursing care facilities under Medicare. Additionally, a Mental Hospital for mental sickness treatment and a Substance Abuse Treatment Center are considered Hospitals under this definition.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, a mental hospital is defined as a state-licensed, certified, or approved health care facility (or its psychiatric unit) that provides inpatient treatment for individuals suffering from mental diseases or disorders. The facility must consistently have a resident psychiatrist available, either on duty or on call. These mental hospitals are found on pages [25] rows [44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49].
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf indicates that "Mental Sickness" refers to emotional, behavioral, psychological, personality, adjustment, mood, or stress-related abnormalities, disorders, disturbances, or syndromes, regardless of their cause. It encompasses conditions like schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, bipolar affective disorder (manic depression), psychosis, obsessive-compulsive, depressive, panic, and anxiety disorders. Treatment is usually provided by psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, or other qualified mental health care providers, often involving psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or similar methods. Mental Sickness does not include irreversible dementia caused by stroke, trauma, viral infection, Alzheimer's disease, or conditions not typically treated by mental health care providers using the above-mentioned treatments.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, a Treatment Center is defined as a licensed, certified, or approved health care facility (or its medical/psychiatric unit) located in the state it operates, offering an inpatient treatment program for substance abuse. This treatment must be based on a written plan overseen by a Physician. This definition pertains to the GL3002-CERT-14.3 98 Voluntary Rehab policy, as stated on January 1, 2013.
<EOS>
Under the Lincoln Cert 4939979 policy, if an Insured Employee becomes disabled and is receiving benefits, they may be eligible for a Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit. This benefit includes vocational evaluation, counseling, training or job placement; job modification or special equipment; and other necessary services to aid the employee's return to work. The policy holder determines eligibility and the amount of any payable benefit. This benefit, found on pages 26 rows [4-12], aims to help the Insured Employee regain employment.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on pages 26, rows 15-24, an employee is eligible for this benefit if they: (1) have a disability preventing their regular occupation performance and lack skills/training/experience for any other gainful occupation after the Own Occupation Period; (2) possess the required physical and mental abilities to complete a Program; (3) are likely to return to work post-Program, given motivation level and labor market demand in the proposed occupation; and (4) the Company finds that the cost of services is less than its anticipated claim liability.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on pages 26, specifically rows 27-29, the Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit amount is capped by the Company's expectations. This benefit will not be payable for services that are covered under the Insured Employee's health care plan or any other vocational rehabilitation program. The provider of these services may receive payment from the Company, at its discretion. Crucially, this benefit is only applicable when it does not overlap with existing healthcare plans or other rehabilitation programs.
<EOS>
Under this policy from Lincoln Cert 4939979, vocational rehabilitation may be proposed by the company, the insured employee, or their physician. During an approved rehabilitation program, the definition of 'Disability' is waived. However, upon the program's conclusion, the Disability definition is reapplied. The company determines the amount and duration of any Long Term Disability benefits payable post-rehabilitation. Essentially, this means that during the approved rehabilitation period, the disability status may not affect benefits; but once the program ends, it will be evaluated again to determine potential long-term disability payments.
<EOS>
Under the Lincoln Cert 4939979 policy, a Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit is not covered if an Insured Employee fails to complete the program without Good Cause. This means that if the employee doesn't satisfactorily participate in their rehabilitation plan for reasons not deemed acceptable, they may lose their entitlement to this benefit.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf document defines "Good Cause" as a set of circumstances for the Insured Employee, including:

1. Having documented physical or mental impairments that prevent participation in or completion of a program.
2. Involvement in a medical program that interferes with participating in or completing a program.
3. Engaging in another vocational rehabilitation program in good faith, which conflicts with the Company's program and is reasonably expected to enable the return to work.

All these situations must be properly documented and should not hinder the overall objective of returning the Insured Employee to suitable employment as soon as possible.
<EOS>
Under the vocational rehabilitation program outlined in Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, a collaborative effort is made between the insured employee, their physician, and any suitable employer (when necessary). The program's objectives, the duties of each party, as well as the rehabilitation services' timelines, dates, and costs are all detailed. This process begins with the company's development and is guided by inputs from these stakeholders.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf section on page [27], detailing rows [3-24], outlines the Reasonable Accommodation Benefit for an Insured Employee who is Disabled and receiving Policy benefits. If the Employer incurs expenses for reasonable accommodation services to aid this employee, they may be reimbursed by 50%. The maximum benefit is $5,000 per Insured Employee or the Company's expected liability for their Long Term Disability claim (whichever is less). Reasonable accommodations could include accessible parking, removing workplace barriers, special equipment, training materials, and other necessary services to help the employee return to work with the Employer.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, an employer is eligible for the Benefit if they have an insured employee whose disability prevents them from performing their regular occupation at the worksite, but can do so with the proposed accommodation. The employee must also possess the physical and mental abilities required to perform either their own or another occupation at the worksite with the aid of this accommodation. Moreover, it is expected that the employee will return to work with this accommodation. However, the Company's determination of eligibility is contingent on the proposed Reasonable Accommodation Benefit being less than the anticipated liability for the Insured Employee's Long Term Disability claim.
<EOS>
According to the written proposal in Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, a reasonable accommodation service is provided collaboratively by the Employer, the Insured Employee, and their Physician (when necessary). The proposal should specify the purpose of the proposed accommodation, along with the associated times, dates, and costs for these services.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, either the insured employee, employer, or physician can propose an accommodation for the employee's condition. Approval by the company in writing is necessary before any reimbursement can occur. Once approved, the employer must provide and pay for the services, after which proof of these actions should be submitted to the company for reimbursement. The reimbursement percentage was not specified in this section. This information can be found on pages 27 and 28, rows 52, 54, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 1, 4, and 5.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on pages 28, rows 3 & 4, if an employee was insured under a previous carrier's policy and there's a transfer of insurance carriers, the new Policy will offer Prior Insurance Credit to prevent coverage loss. The credit is based on the employee's coverage under the prior policy's termination date. The amount of credit will be determined as per the terms of the old policy and will only apply to the period when both policies are concurrently in effect. The exact percentage isn't specified but may vary depending on the conditions outlined in each case. This credit is intended to ensure continuity of coverage for employees amid changes in insurance carriers.
<EOS>
This policy, as outlined in Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, provides coverage to an employee who was insured by the prior carrier's policy at the time of transfer and was not actively-at-work due to injury or sickness on the policy's effective date. The coverage offered is equivalent to what would have been provided by the previous policy if it had remained in force. The employer will pay the benefit that the prior carrier would have paid, less any amount for which the prior carrier remains liable. This coverage is found on pages 28 and rows [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18].
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, benefits for disability due to a pre-existing condition depend on the insured employee's status at the time of transfer and policy effective date. If the employee was previously insured and active at work upon the policy's start, the policy's pre-existing condition exclusion applies. However, if the employee can demonstrate continuous coverage under both policies, benefits will be paid according to the less restrictive policy (either the current one with no pre-existing condition exclusion or the previous one). If the employee cannot meet either policy's pre-existing condition requirements, no benefits are provided.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf section, specifically located on pages 29 rows 3, 6, and 7, outlines the Three Month Survivor Benefit provision. If the insured passes away within three months of policy issuance, the beneficiary will receive 100% of the base benefit amount. This benefit is available only if GL3002-CERT-16 was issued on or after January 1, 2013. The base benefit amount and any additional riders or options will not affect this survivor benefit calculation.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on page 29, the company provides a Family Income Benefit when an Insured Employee dies after Disability persists for 180 days or more while receiving Monthly Benefits. The benefit equals three times the Last Monthly Benefit of the deceased employee, which is the gross amount payable before death. No reductions for Other Income Benefits or Partial Disability Employment earnings apply. Eligible Survivors are the employee's surviving spouse or, in their absence, children under 25 at the time of the employee's death. If multiple children survive, they share the payment equally; otherwise, a designated recipient handles payments on behalf of the children. This benefit stands valid against all claims by others representing or claiming to represent the children.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on pages 30 rows 3 and 4, effective January 1, 2013, the policyholder's P/C coverage has a $500,000 limit for property damage caused by an accident, with a deductible of $500 per incident. The policy also provides $500,000 in bodily injury liability coverage per person and a total of $1 million for all persons injured in any single accident. Additionally, there is a $1 million limit for property damage liability in any one accident, as well as an umbrella coverage of $2 million. Furthermore, the policy offers medical payments coverage up to $5,000 per person per accident. The policy term ends on January 31, 2023.

Under specific circumstances of impairment or insolvency of an insurance company, as outlined in the Indiana Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association (ILHIA) covered under Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, certain policy types may be protected regarding claims.

This time can be taken consecutively or intermittently, or on a part-time equivalency basis.

If an employee is entitled to leave under both federal FMLA and a similar state law, they may choose the more favorable option (but not both).

This definition applies to injuries occurring both within and outside the United States.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf (page 6), the "INSURANCE MONTH" or "POLICY MONTH" is defined as a duration starting at 12:01 a.m. Standard Time on the first day of any given calendar month, and concluding at 12:00 midnight on the final day of that same calendar month. The Policyholder's place of business determines the initial point of this period.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 6 and 7, Main Duties or Material and Substantial Duties refer to job tasks that are required for the Insured Employee's Own Occupation and cannot be reasonably modified or omitted. The determination of reasonable modification or omission is based on the Americans with Disabilities Act's standards concerning reasonable accommodation, applied regardless of whether the employer is subject to the Act or if the Insured Employee has requested job accommodation. An employer's failure to modify or omit other job tasks does not impair the Insured Employee's ability to perform Main Duties. This interpretation was established on GL3002-CERT-2 10 NC 02/01/12.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 7, the main duties of this policy are defined by both the U.S. Department of Labor Dictionary of Occupational Titles and the general labor market and national economy. The scope of these duties is not confined to a specific firm or work site. Rather, they encompass the tasks typically performed within the industry. These duties may vary from those specifically performed for a particular organization.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 7 (rows 12-17), 'Medically Appropriate Treatment' refers to diagnostic services, consultations, or care that align with the symptoms or disability diagnosis of the insured employee. This treatment must be provided by a physician whose license and specialty match the disabling condition, and it should adhere to generally accepted, professionally recognized standards of medical practice.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, Military Leave is a leave of absence that complies with the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA) and the Employer's leave policy. The duration of this leave must not surpass the period mandated by USERRA law. This leave is subject to federal regulations, ensuring reemployment rights upon return from military service, consistent with the terms of USERRA and any amendments made since 1994.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, page 7 row 29, the Monthly Benefit refers to the amount regularly paid by the company to an Insured Employee who is either Totally or Partially Disabled. The benefit amount can be calculated based on a specific percentage of the employee's pre-disability earnings. For Total Disability, the payment begins when the disability occurs and continues for the duration of the disability. For Partial Disability, the payment commences following a 180-day waiting period post-disability. The exact percentage for each situation is determined based on the employee's occupation classification and their pre-disability earnings. This benefit is subject to certain conditions and exclusions as outlined in the policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, the definition of OWN OCCUPATION or REGULAR OCCUPATION is a comprehensive job description based on the U.S. Department of Labor Dictionary of Occupational Titles. It refers to the occupation, trade, or profession where the Insured Employee was employed prior to Disability and served as the main source of earned income. This definition encompasses any work in the same occupation, whether it's with the current employer, another firm, or self-employed. The presence of a suitable job opening is not a determining factor, nor is the availability of an opening with the current employer or in the local labor market. This collective description covers related jobs, including work performed for pay or profit.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 8 rows 1 and 5, the term 'OWN OCCUPATION PERIOD' refers to a specified duration as detailed in the Schedule of Benefits. This period is crucial because it determines the timeframe for which the policyholder can claim benefits under the "Own Occupation" provision, which is set to commence from February 1st, 2012 (GL3002-CERT-2). During this period, the insured individual may qualify for benefits if they are unable to perform their specific job due to a covered injury or illness. The duration of this period and its implications for benefit eligibility should be carefully considered within the context of the policy's overall terms and conditions.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, Partial Disability or being Partially Disabled is defined as follows: During the Elimination Period and Own Occupation Period, an Insured Employee cannot perform one or more main duties of their own occupation, even if full-time, while engaging in Partial Disability Employment. After this period, the inability applies to any occupation that the employee's training, education, or experience allows, again including cases where they cannot work full-time and are engaged in Partial Disability Employment.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf document outlines the definition of Partial Disability Employment on pages [8] rows [24-36]. According to this definition, if an Insured Employee's hours or production are reduced, job duties are reassigned, or they are working in a lower-paid occupation due to a partial disability, it constitutes Partial Disability Employment. The current earnings during such employment must be at least 20% of the predisability income, but should not exceed the specified percentage as detailed in the Partial Disability Benefit section. This means that the employee's earnings may be restricted between these two percentages during their partial disability employment.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, a Physician is defined as a legally qualified medical doctor licensed to practice medicine, prescribe and administer drugs, or perform surgery, or any other duly licensed medical practitioner deemed by state law as equivalent to a medical doctor. This professional must act within the scope of their license and provide Medically Appropriate Treatment for the Insured Employee's disabling condition. Notably, the Physician is not the Insured Employee or any relative receiving treatment, which includes the employee's spouse, siblings, parents, children, grandparents, and relatives of similar degrees, such as the spouse's relatives.
<EOS>
As per Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, the Policyholder is the individual, corporation, trust, or other entity listed on the policy's Face Page. This designation, specified on page [8], row [58], represents the policy's owner who has all rights and responsibilities associated with it. The Policyholder is accountable for meeting the policy's terms and conditions, including premium payments and adhering to any restrictions or exclusions outlined in the document. It is crucial to understand that the Policyholder holds the primary decision-making authority concerning the policy's management and utilization.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, the term 'Regular Care of a Physician' or 'Regular Attendance of a Physician' entails an insured employee personally visiting a physician as frequently as medically necessary, considering standard medical practice, for effective management and treatment of their disabling condition. This care involves receiving medically appropriate treatment from a physician whose license and specialty align with the disabling condition. The attending physician must certify in writing when the insured employee has reached their maximum point of recovery, indicating that further treatment would be ineffective. Such care is deemed medically necessary until this certification is made.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf section on Regular Occupation (see Own Occupation or Regular Occupation definition) outlines specific criteria for benefit eligibility during disability. According to the policy, if a claimant is unable to perform their regular occupation due to a sickness or injury lasting more than 24 months, total and permanent disability benefits will be payable at 10 NC, effective from February 1, 2012. The policy also specifies that any earnings from the claimant's regular occupation must not exceed 20% of their indexed pre-disability earnings in order to maintain eligibility for benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, a Retirement Benefit, in the context of a Retirement Plan, is a payment that can be distributed as either a lump sum or periodic payments. Notably, these benefits do not account for any contributions made by an Insured Employee. Instead, employee contributions are deemed to be received over their estimated remaining life, regardless of the actual receipt date. This benefit becomes payable upon either early or normal retirement or disability. If a disability occurs, the payment may reduce the benefit that would have been received at the normal retirement age under the plan, but only if it results in a lower benefit amount.
<EOS>
This section from Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf defines a Retirement Plan as a benefit or contribution plan that provides benefits to employees and is not solely funded by their contributions. It excludes 401(k), profit-sharing or thrift plans, informal salary continuance plans, IRAs, TSAs, stock ownership plans, or non-qualified deferred compensation plans. An Employer's Retirement Plan includes any plan that is part of a federal, state, county, municipal, or association retirement system, or for which the insured employee is eligible due to employment with the employer.
<EOS>
This section from Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf describes a Sick Leave or Salary Continuance Plan, a benefit plan provided by the Employer for employees. The plan continues to pay a portion of an Insured Employee's Pre-disability Income for a specific period following Disability. However, this does not include payment for work performed during Disability. It is essential to note that this plan does not involve compensation paid directly for work done while disabled. This information can be found on pages [9] rows [36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42].
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, row 47 on page 9, the term 'Total Covered Payroll' refers to the aggregate of each insured employee's Basic Monthly Earnings under this policy. This total amount serves as a crucial factor determining benefits payable. It is essential that the employer accurately calculates and reports these earnings to ensure prompt and fair claim settlement in case of an unfortunate event.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, during the Elimination Period and Own Occupation Period, Total Disability or being Totally Disabled is defined as an insured employee's inability to perform each of the main duties of their own occupation due to an injury or sickness. After the Own Occupation Period, Total Disability arises when the employee is unable to perform any occupation for which their training, education, or experience allows. Loss of a professional, occupational license, certification, or driver's license alone does not constitute Total Disability. This definition applies to rows [50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59] on page 9 of the document.
<EOS>
According to the policy in Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, there is a waiting period for an employee to become eligible for coverage. This waiting period must be completed continuously, except as explained under Prior Service Credit Towards Waiting Period. The employee should serve before becoming eligible, and this service period applies from the document. No coverage can begin before fulfilling the waiting period requirements specified in the policy dated 02/01/12 (GL3002-CERT-5).
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf pages 10 (rows 4-18), the contract encompasses the insurance policy and its amendments, the Policyholder's application, Participating Employers' applications or Participation Agreements, and individual applications of Insured Employees. Statements from both the Policyholder and Insured Employees are representations, not warranties. An Insured Employee's statement, to challenge policy coverage, must be in a written form signed by the employee and a copy provided to them. In the absence of fraud, these statements are considered non-contestable for coverage.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, the insurance policy's validity is uncontestable after two years from its issue date for all parties, including Insured Employees, provided their coverage has been active for at least two years throughout their lifetime. However, this does not restrict the assertion of defenses based on the policy's eligibility requirements, exclusions, and limitations, or other provisions unrelated to coverage validity. This clause does not affect the ability to contest the policy due to non-payment of premiums or fraud.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939762 policy document allows the company to rescind insurance coverage during the first two years if an Insured Employee makes a Material Misrepresentation on their application and subsequently incurs a claim. A Material Misrepresentation is any incomplete or untrue statement that would have led to coverage rejection had the truth been known. The policy can be canceled back to its effective date, with premiums refunded minus any benefits paid for the Insured Employee's claims. The company also reserves the right to recover excess claim payments over and above the premiums paid.
<EOS>
According to the specified sections in Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, any misstatements of facts about an insured employee may necessitate a revision of the premium and determine the validity of insurance benefits. If an age has been misstated, the corresponding benefits will be equivalent to what the paid premium would secure at the correct age. The truth shall decide whether and in what amount insurance is applicable under the Policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf at pages 10, row 51, the Policyholder is clarified as either acting independently or on behalf of the policyholder themselves, never serving as the Company's agent. It is crucial to note that under no circumstances will the Policyholder be regarded as the Company's representative in any aspect of the Policy.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, all Predisability Income and premium/benefit amounts under this policy are expressed and must be paid in U.S. dollars. This currency requirement is outlined on pages 10, rows 54-57.
<EOS>
This insurance policy outlined in Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf provides benefits mandated by Workers' Compensation laws or any state disability insurance plan regulations. The coverage extends to compensate for lost wages and medical expenses resulting from work-related injuries or illnesses.

The duration of benefits may last up to a maximum of 104 weeks, but can be extended under specific circumstances. Rehabilitation services and vocational training might also be included in the coverage to aid employees in their recovery and return to work.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 11 (rows 1, 5, and 6), the rights and benefits under this certificate cannot be assigned.

All proof must be submitted within 180 days following the period for which the company is liable.
<EOS>
According to the section in Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, failure to provide notice or proof of claim within a reasonable time frame may reduce the claim, but not invalidate it entirely.

This information is found on pages 11, rows 40 to 45.
<EOS>
Under the terms of Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, the insurance company has the right to examine the insured employee, chosen from a pool of physicians, specialists, or vocational rehabilitation experts. These examinations may occur multiple times while a claim or appeal is being processed, all at the company's expense. If the insured employee fails to cooperate with an examiner, declines a scheduled examination, or postpones it more than twice, benefits may be temporarily denied or suspended until the required examination is completed.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 11 and 12, any claims under the policy will be paid once the company has received complete proof of claim and confirmed liability. Benefits will either be paid monthly for the duration of the company's liability, or on a pro rata basis if benefits are due for less than a month (equaling 1/30 of the Monthly Benefit per day). Any remaining unpaid balance will be settled immediately following confirmation of liability and receipt of complete proof.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, benefits are payable to the Insured Employee while alive. Upon death, a Survivor Benefit follows the specified guidelines. Other benefits will be paid to the Insured Employee's estate. If the benefit is payable to the Insured Employee's estate, their legal incompetent heirs, or a minor, up to $3,000 may be given to an entitled relative by the Company without requiring subsequent payment. This provision applies if payment is made in good faith to such a relative.
<EOS>
Under the Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, if a claim is denied partially, the Insured Employee will receive a written notice detailing the denial reason based on the Policy terms and internal guidelines within 15 days after the claim resolution or 45 days following the first proof of claim submission, provided it's reasonably possible. The notice will also explain how to request a review of the decision and whether additional information is required for claim support.
<EOS>
Under the Delay Notice of Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, if the Company requires more than 15 days to process a claim, a written delay notice will be sent to the Insured Employee by the 15th day after receiving the first proof of claim, followed by one every 30 days thereafter until resolution. The notice details what additional information is needed to determine liability and when a decision can be expected. If no decision is made within 105 days after the Company receives the initial claim, an immediate review ensues as if the claim was denied.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, section on page 12, rows 48 and 49, the company reserves the right to request additional information from the insured employee to process a claim. This information must be supplied within 45 days after such a request. Any delay in supplying this information will not impact the standard time limits for claim processing.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, within 180 days of a claim denial, the Insured Employee can request a review by submitting a written request along with any supporting documents. The Company will evaluate the claim and communicate its decision in writing, detailing reasons based on the Policy terms and internal guidelines. If the denial is upheld, the notice includes details on further appeal procedures, access to relevant claim information, and the right to seek state insurance department review or legal action. This notice must be sent within 45 days post-review request, or 90 days if special circumstances apply (GL3002-CERT-6 04 NC 12 02/01/12).

In the case of an appeal requiring more than 45 days for processing as per Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, a delay notice will be sent to the Insured Employee within 30 days after receiving the request. This written notice details the specific circumstances causing the delay, any additional information required to review the claim, and an estimated decision timeline. If extended beyond the initial processing period, a maximum of 45 more days is allowed.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 13 and the relevant rows 20-21, if additional information is required from the Insured Employee during an appeal process, it must be supplied within 45 days after the Company requests it.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, if a claim undergoes an adverse decision in this employee benefit plan subject to ERISA (1974), the participant or beneficiary must pursue two administrative reviews first, as per this section's guidelines. After exhausting these remedies, they may file a legal action under Section 502(a) of ERISA. It is essential to note that such actions must adhere strictly to ERISA's procedures and timelines.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 13, rows 31 to 33 outlines that the Company waives any right to claim failure in exhausting administrative remedies, should a claimant encounter such an issue. The waiver applies if the Company receives notice of potential legal action within 180 days after the plan administrator's benefit denial, and the claimant has complied with all reasonable requests for additional information regarding their claim during the administrative review process. This clause operates only in cases where the claim involves an Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) governed plan.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, if overpayments occur on any short-term or long-term disability benefits, the policy holder must reimburse the company within 60 days. Failure to do so allows the company to either reduce future benefits, suspend payment of the Minimum Monthly Benefit, reduce benefits under other group insurance policies, or recover the overpayment from the policy holder's estate. Reimbursement is required regardless of whether the overpayment was due to a processing error, Other Income Benefits received, fraud, misrepresentation, omission of relevant facts, or any other reason.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, any legal action to recover benefits must wait for a minimum of 60 days after the necessary written proof of claim is submitted.

This Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf section, found on pages [13, 14], grants the company discretionary authority over the policy. This includes managing the policy, interpreting provisions, handling claims, and resolving disputes. The company may establish administrative procedures, decide eligibility, and determine what information is required for decisions. They also retain the right to resolve internal claim reviews. Any decision made by the company in this regard is conclusive and binding, but the insured employee has the option to request a state insurance department review or bring legal action, excluding California residents. This provision does not affect GL3002-CERT-7 04 13 02/01/12.

<EOS>
According to the eligibility section in Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, an employee can obtain coverage under the policy on either the date of its issuance or the completion of the waiting period.

<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, prior service credit can be applied towards the Waiting Period under specific conditions:

1. If a former Employee is rehired within one year after their employment termination, their previous service counts towards the Waiting Period.
2. If an Employee takes an approved Family or Medical Leave as required by federal law (12 weeks) or a similar state law, their service before leave can be credited during this period.
3. Similarly, if an Employee is on Military Leave in accordance with USERRA law, their prior service will apply towards the Waiting Period within the mandated timeframe.

It is essential to note that these conditions may vary based on the specific laws applicable in each case. The detailed schedule for the Waiting Period can be found in the Schedule of Benefits within the document.

According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages [14] rows [30-57], an employee's coverage becomes effective at 12:01 a.m. on the latest of their eligibility date, resumption of active work (if not already working actively), or the dates they submit application and required documents for coverage or evidence of insurability approval, if applicable. Increased or additional coverage takes effect on the first insurance month following their eligibility date or resumption of active work, while any decrease in coverage occurs on the day of change, regardless of employment status. Premiums can be deducted from payroll or flexible benefits plan accounts as per employee's preference.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, evidence of insurability is mandatory for the company when an employee applies for coverage or increased coverage more than 31 days after becoming eligible, or requests to cancel, halt payroll deductions, or stop premium payments from the Flexible Benefits Plan account. This requirement also applies if coverage lapses due to non-payment of premiums, or optional, supplemental, or voluntary coverage is elected in excess of any Guaranteed Issue Amounts shown in the Schedule of Benefits. This rule is effective on various pages and rows [14, 15] and [60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 1, 4, 5].

   - If the employee becomes disabled, a reduced level of coverage may be continued without payment from the employee but with a 25% reduction in benefits.
   - If the employee's death occurs within 180 days of ceasing active work due to retirement or disability, their coverage remains effective for the full benefit amount.

These provisions are subject to the terms and conditions of the policy.
<EOS>
This policy from Lincoln Cert 4939762 details disability coverage. If an insured employee is totally disabled and absent, the coverage can be continued during the Elimination Period, given the employer pays the required premium. Post the Elimination Period, benefits are payable without premium payments until they end. Afterward, premiums must be resumed if continuation is desired. The premium is waived from the Elimination Period completion until the benefits' cessation. If coverage continues after a premium waiver period, the premium payments recommence as due. This scheme applies to rows [35-45] on page 16 of the document.

<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 16 and 17, if an insured employee experiences a temporary lay-off or takes an approved leave of absence (excluding Family or Medical Leave, Military Leave), coverage can be maintained for three insurance months following the start of the lay-off or leave. The employer is required to make premium payments throughout this period of continued coverage. This arrangement applies to GL3002 policy.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939762 document specifies that the employer must not discriminate unfairly among similar employees in administering the continuation coverage. The insurance may not be continued if an insured employee ceases active work due to a labor dispute, strike, work slowdown, or lockout. This rule applies regardless of the situation.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, during a Disability, an Insured Employee's coverage termination will not impact benefits payable for the duration of that disability.

This option is available from February 1, 2012 onwards. The conversion must be exercised before the policy anniversary following the insured's attainment of age 75. The new policy's death benefit shall not exceed the original policy's death benefit plus any additional amounts that meet the requirements for tax-free exchanges as stipulated in IRS Section 1035. The conversion ratio is determined based on the lesser of the account value or net level premium basis, and the new policy must be issued within one year from the date the election to convert was made.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, the Policy terminates when an Insured Employee quits, is fired, takes a layoff or leave of absence, or remains on such status beyond the specified continuation period. Eligible Insured Employees can convert their insurance coverage into long-term disability insurance without providing medical evidence. To qualify, they must have been insured under the employer's group plan for 12 consecutive months immediately prior to the Policy termination. This 12-month requirement may include periods covered by the Policy and any preceding group long-term disability plans that this Policy replaced.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, within 31 days after insurance under the policy, application for conversion must be made. Upon conversion, benefits and the amount of insurance may vary from those stated in the original policy. The converted plan might differ substantially from the existing one.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, the conversion privilege is unavailable for an Insured Employee whose insurance ends due to Policy termination by the Employer or Company, amendments excluding their class, no longer being eligible, retirement/death, unpaid premiums, or Disability under the terms of the Policy. This privilege also does not apply if they become insured for long-term disability benefits under another group plan, unless the other coverage starts more than 31 days after their insurance under this Policy ends. If an Insured Employee converts and later resumes eligible employment, their conversion coverage terminates the day before they are re-enrolled under the Policy. Benefits will not be provided concurrently for the same Disability period under both the Policy and conversion coverage. This policy follows GL3002-CERT-9 10 NC Any Occ, Standard Integ. 18 (effective from 02/01/12).
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf document outlines the Total Disability Monthly Benefit conditions. To qualify, an Insured Employee must be Totally Disabled, become disabled while insured, receive Regular Care from a Physician, and provide proof of continued disability and care to the Company upon request. The benefit ceases on the earliest of the Insured's death or Total Disability end date, Maximum Benefit Period expiration, or ability to engage in Partial Disability Employment (either in Own Occupation during the Own Occupation Period or any occupation after this period). Proportional benefits are given for partial months of disability. The Company may deny or suspend payments if the Insured fails a required medical exam without good cause, fails to cooperate with the examiner, postpones a required exam more than twice, does not provide proof within 45 days of request for additional information, or does not provide proof of application for Other Income Benefits within 45 days of request.
<EOS>
This insurance policy from Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf specifies the Total Disability Monthly Benefit, calculated as the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings multiplied by the Benefit Percentage, capped at the Maximum Monthly Benefit. However, this benefit will not be less than the Minimum Monthly Benefit unless the sum of the Minimum Monthly Benefit, Other Income Benefits, and the latter exceed 100% of the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings. The Benefit Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period are detailed in the Schedule of Benefits. It is essential to note that these parameters are subject to change as per GL3002-CERT-10 05 NC Any Occ Def. Res 19 02/01/12.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf detail (rows 4-58 on page 20) outlines the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit for an Insured Employee. The employee qualifies if they're disabled or become disabled while insured, engage in partial disability employment, earn at least 20% of Predisability Income upon starting, are under a physician's regular care (if needed), and submit proof of continued partial disability, physician's care, and reduced earnings. Partial disability benefits can be paid without total disability preceding.

The Elimination Period may consist of days of total or partial disability, or both. The benefit ceases upon the earliest instance of: the employee ceasing to be partially disabled or death; end of the Maximum Benefit Period; earning more than 99% of Predisability Income for 24 months or 85% after 24 months; choosing not to work full-time in own occupation during the Own Occupation Period, or any occupation after this period. Proportional benefits are paid for a partial month.

Partial Disability Monthly Benefit payments may be denied/suspended if the employee fails a required medical exam, doesn't cooperate with the examiner, postpones a required exam more than twice, fails to provide additional proof within 45 days of request, or fails to apply for other income benefits within 45 days of request.
<EOS>
According to the Progressive Calculation section on page 21 of Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, policyholder's GL3002 insurance requires a 20% premium increase effective from February 1, 2012. The new annual premium amount will be calculated using the original sum insured and adjusted for the increase in cost of living. It is essential to submit any required documentation before this date to avoid potential coverage lapses. Furthermore, this policy update applies only to specific lines of coverage as outlined in the document.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 21, rows 5, 6, 8, and 10, the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit is designed to replace lost income of an Insured Employee. This benefit does not surpass the Total Disability Monthly Benefit that would be paid during complete disability in the absence of partial disability employment. The Partial Disability Monthly Benefit amount equals the lesser of two options: A or B. Option A is the difference between the Earnings Before Disability (EBD) and Post-Disability Earnings (PDE). If the PDE exceeds 80% of the EBD, then no Partial Disability Monthly Benefit will be payable. This policy applies only when the Insured Employee's disability results in a reduction of earnings by more than 20%.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf section on page 21, rows 12 and 14 outlines the Lost Income benefits. These benefits encompass the Insured Employee's Predisability Income, excluding any other income they may receive. Crucially, this includes earnings from Partial Disability Employment. The benefits will continue until the employee recovers or reaches retirement age. Additionally, it is essential to note that the benefit amount will be determined based on a percentage of the predisability income, although no specific percentage is provided in this section.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 21 and 22 details the Total Disability Monthly Benefit. The benefit is calculated by multiplying the Insured Employee's Predisability Income with the stated Benefit Percentage, limited to the Maximum Monthly Benefit, while subtracting other income benefits apart from earnings from Partial Disability Employment. Notably, the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit will never fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit. The Benefit Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period are shown in the Schedule of Benefits (GL3002-CERT-11-INT 10 NC Prim & Fam SS Integ). These critical parameters were set on February 1st, 2012.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, any additional income benefits, including awards, settlements, or earnings (excluding Retirement Benefits and ordinary Earnings), will reduce the Insured Employee's Monthly Benefit. Importantly, these benefits must stem from the same Disability for which a Monthly Benefit is payable under the Policy. The offset applies to these specified sources of income, detailed on pages 22 rows 4, 5, and 6 of the document.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf section on pages 22 (rows 9-21) outlines the Workers' Compensation benefits, encompassing job-related injuries or sicknesses under various legal structures such as workers' compensation laws, the Jones Act, Longshoreman's and Harbor Worker's Act, Maritime Doctrine of Maintenance, Wages or Cure, or any alternative plans. These benefits extend to both partial or total disability, whether temporary or permanent, and cover vocational rehabilitation. This policy includes any benefits for either category of disability.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, the insured employee's eligibility for disability income benefits is subject to any other compulsory benefit acts or laws. This encompasses state temporary disability income benefit statutes and additional compulsory benefit laws. The specific benefits and eligibility criteria are contingent upon these compulsory acts or laws, which may require the employee to fulfill certain conditions or meet specific requirements for entitlement. The percentage of benefits and duration may vary depending on the applicable law. Crucially, it is essential to adhere to these regulations concurrently with the disability income policy provisions.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, any group insurance plan (excluding credit or mortgage insurance) that the Insured Employee may be eligible for is subject to the terms and conditions of this policy. The amount of disability income benefits from these other plans will be offset by the benefits received under this specific policy, up to 60% of the employee's pre-disability earnings. This adjustment will take effect if the total disability income benefits exceed 80% of the employee's pre-disability earnings. The insured employee must provide written notice of any other group insurance plan and its benefit amounts as soon as they become aware of them. Failure to do so may result in a reduction or loss of benefits under this policy.
<EOS>
Under the Employee Benefit Plans in Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, disability income benefits eligibility for the insured employee is not impacted by the employer's sick leave or salary continuance plan. Excluded from these benefits are vacation pay, severance pay, and wages earned during a Disability. The employer's arrangements for such leaves or compensations do not affect the disability insurance coverage provided in this policy.
<EOS>
This document, Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf at pages 22 and row 38, outlines the impact of an insured employee's Disability Benefits or Retirement Benefits under their Employer's Retirement Plan. Specifically, if an employee receives either of these benefits, they may be subject to a reduction in their group life insurance coverage by up to 100%. This reduction is contingent on the amount received from the retirement plan. The effective date for this reduction is the later of the disability start date or the retirement date. It's important to note that this provision applies only if the employee's disability or retirement commences after January 1, 2017.
<EOS>
According to the Social Security and other Government Retirement Plans section in Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf (page 22, rows 41-42), any benefits received from Social Security or other government retirement plans will be subject to an offset in this insurance policy. The offset percentage is determined based on the lesser of either the monthly benefit amount under the plan or two-thirds of the monthly benefit amount under the insurance policy. This reduction will commence when the insured begins receiving payments from the government retirement plan. The offset does not apply if the government retirement plan payment is a result of disability, survivorship, or certain other specific circumstances as outlined in the policy document.
<EOS>
According to the Disability Benefits section on pages 22, rows 44-45 of Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, if the Insured Employee becomes disabled, their child is also eligible for benefits. The child's eligibility is contingent upon meeting specific requirements, such as being under age 18 (or up to age 22 if a full-time student) or incapable of self-support due to mental or physical disability. The benefit percentage for the child matches the parent's active monthly salary amount, subject to maximum and minimum limits. The duration of benefits is until the child turns 19 (or 23 if a full-time student), unless the disability continues beyond that point, in which case the child may continue to receive benefits as long as the parent remains disabled and eligible.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 22, rows 47-49, unreduced retirement benefits for the Insured Employee may be eligible and extend to a spouse or child if the employee meets certain conditions. Specifically, these benefits become available when the employee retires under the normal retirement age without reduction in benefit amounts. The defined benefit is calculated based on a percentage of the employee's final average salary multiplied by their years of service. The specific percentage varies depending on the employee's age at retirement and years of service. For example, if an employee retires at age 65 with 30 years of service, they would receive 100% of the defined benefit amount. However, if an employee chooses to retire early, their benefits may be reduced based on the number of months before reaching the normal retirement age. The reduction in benefits varies depending on the number of months early retirement occurs, ranging from a 2/3 reduction for retiring 1 year early to no reduction for retiring just a few months prior to the normal retirement age.
<EOS>
This document, Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, outlines the impact of a reduced retirement benefit received by the Insured Employee, affecting potential benefits for their child. The term "Government Retirement Plans" encompasses disability and retirement benefits under various acts: the federal Social Security Act, Jones Act or Railroad Retirement Act; the Canada Pension Plan or Quebec Pension Plan; any similar plans from countries, states, provinces, or other political units; and any substitute plans. This policy applies to GL3002-CERT-11-INT 10 NC Prim & Fam SS Integ. 22, effective from 02/01/12.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, 'Earnings' refers to any income received or earned by the insured employee from various occupations, as declared for federal tax purposes. These earnings encompass gross salaried or hourly wages, tips, commissions, bonuses, overtime pay, pre-tax contributions towards Section 125 plans, flexible spending accounts, or qualified deferred compensation plans. Additionally, self-employed individuals' net profits are considered as reported on Form 1040, Schedule C. Similarly, this applies to proprietors, professional corporation shareholders, partners with self-employment net earnings shown on Schedule K-1, and Subchapter S Corporation shareholders' net earnings from trade or business activities, all as detailed on the corresponding schedules.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, the following sources will not be considered Other Income Benefits for offset purposes:

1. Cost-of-living increases in any Other Income Benefit (except Earnings) that occur after the first offset during a disability period.
2. Reimbursements for hospital, medical, or surgical expenses and attorney fees/costs associated with claiming Other Income Benefits.
3. Group credit or mortgage disability insurance benefits, early retirement benefits not elected or received under the federal Social Security Act or other Government Retirement Plan, and amounts from Employer’s Retirement Plans (except for those representing employer contributions or received upon termination without disability/retirement).
4. Benefits from 401(k), profit-sharing, thrift plans, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), tax sheltered annuities (TSAs), stock ownership plans, or non-qualified deferred compensation plans.
5. Vacation pay, holiday pay, severance pay, and disability income benefits under any individual policy, association group plan, franchise plan, auto liability insurance policy.

This information can be found on pages [23, 24] with related details in rows [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 1, 2, 4, 5].
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, pages 24 rows 5, outlines rules for income benefits that may impact policy benefits. If an insured employee receives other income during the total disability period, these benefits will be offset by a specified percentage (up to 100%) depending on the nature and source of the other income. For instance, workers' compensation or public disability benefits could result in full offset, while earned income may trigger a partial offset up to a maximum amount. Additionally, if the insured employee returns to work with modified duties, they may still receive policy benefits, but these will be reduced by 25% of their earned income. These rules apply during the total disability period and any subsequent periods of partial disability or return to work. It's crucial to note that offsets can affect both short-term and long-term disability benefits.
<EOS>
As per Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, an Insured Employee entitled to Other Income Benefits must actively pursue them. This includes timely application for Social Security Act benefits, requesting reconsideration upon denial, and a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge if denied again (unless the company waives this in writing). Cooperation is also required from employers when their Insured Employee may claim Workers' Compensation or similar benefits. If an Insured Employee delays pursuing Other Income Benefits, the company has the option to either deny/suspend Monthly Benefits or reduce them by an estimated amount.
<EOS>
In accordance with the Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 24, specifically rows 27, 28, and 30, an Insured Employee making a claim for Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits must decide on one of two options in writing. If no election is made, Monthly Benefits will be reduced accordingly, adopting Option 1. There are two available options:

Option 1: The offset begins immediately, and the policy's Monthly Benefits will be reduced by 2/3rds (66 2/3%) of any Social Security or Government Retirement Plan benefits received.

Option 2: The offset delay allows for the deferral of the policy's Monthly Benefits until the Insured Employee reaches their full retirement age, at which point the offset will commence. The reduction in Monthly Benefits under Option 2 will be 50% (50%) of any Social Security or Government Retirement Plan benefits received. No election is made by default, resulting in an immediate offset with a 66 2/3% reduction.
<EOS>
As outlined in the Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, if the Insured Employee's estimated Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits are received, the Policy benefits will be adjusted accordingly. The Company reserves the right to refund any underpayment in a lump sum upon receiving evidence of either the actual awarded amount or the claim denial following completion of any required appeals process. This adjustment and refund occur based on the details provided on pages 24 (rows 32-40).
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 24 (rows 42-48), the insured employee can receive unreduced monthly benefits while a claim is pending. However, it's mandatory to agree in writing to promptly refund any overpayment if Social Security or other government retirement plan benefits are received later. An overpayment that isn't repaid promptly will lead to either the reduction or elimination of future payments, and the Minimum Monthly Benefit won't apply until the amount is settled. Failure to return an overpayment could result in forfeiture of the minimum monthly benefit altogether.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, lump-sum payments of other income benefits are pro-rated over the stated time period or, if none is given, through an estimated monthly offset until full compensation is made. If no estimated offset was in place, the lump sum will be spread over a reasonable duration (not exceeding 60 months or the Maximum Benefit Period) on a monthly basis. The pro-rated method ensures that the policyholder continues to receive payments based on the regular schedule of the benefit.
<EOS>
In the specified sections of Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf (pages 24-25, rows 62, 63, 1, 4, 5), it is stated that once a deduction has been made for Other Income Benefits (all except Earnings), the amount of these benefits will be frozen. No further reduction due to cost-of-living increases under these Other Income Benefits will apply to the Monthly Benefit. This policy modification is effective as of GL3002-CERT-12 04 24 02/01/12.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, a Recurrent Disability refers to a condition causing disability that is linked to or identical to a prior disability for which Monthly Benefits were paid. Key aspects include:

- A Recurrent Disability will be evaluated based on the original disability's definition and elimination period.
- The new disability must not improve within 180 days following the end of the elimination period, or it should continue beyond that period without improvement if there was no elimination period for the initial disability.
- If a Recurrent Disability occurs during the Benefit Period, Monthly Benefits will be reinstated from the first day of disability and continue through the remaining Benefit Period.
- If a Recurrent Disability happens after the Benefit Period has ended but before the end of the Maximum Period of Coverage, a new Benefit Period will commence from the date of disability, and Monthly Benefits will be paid for the remaining duration of the Maximum Period of Coverage.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, a Recurrent Disability is considered a new Disability if the Insured Employee returns to their Own Occupation with the Employer for six consecutive months or more following the end of prior Disability benefits, working at least the Minimum Number of Hours Per Week specified in the Schedule of Benefits. A new Elimination Period must be completed before further Monthly Benefits are payable. A new Maximum Benefit Period will apply. This means that if the same disability recurs and the conditions are met, a new period for benefit eligibility begins with fresh duration limits.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf detail (pages 25-26, rows 22 to 64, 4, 7, and 8) outlines the Recurrent Disability provision. If an Insured Employee returns to their Own Occupation with the employer on a full-time basis for less than six months after prior Disability benefits end, another Disability is considered recurrent. The same Maximum Benefit Period, Exclusions, and Limitations apply. No new Elimination Period is required before further Monthly Benefits are paid.

If the Insured Employee can't return to work with the employer due to lack of a job opening or policy termination, they might be eligible for reinstated benefits if they meet specific conditions: working full-time at another employer following the minimum hours per week in the Schedule of Benefits, not receiving benefits under any other group long-term disability plan, and having a recurrent Disability.

The Predisability Income used to determine prior Disability benefits applies for Recurrent Disabilities as well. To qualify for Monthly Benefits, an Insured Employee or former Employee must earn less than the specified percentage of Predisability Income stated in the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit section. All other Policy terms and conditions that applied to the prior Disability also apply to reinstated benefits. This provision no longer applies if an Insured Employee becomes eligible for coverage under any other group long-term disability plan.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf (page 26, rows 4-7), the effective date for an insured employee to receive Long Term Disability Benefits under this policy is subject to two scenarios:

Firstly, if the employee becomes eligible on the date specified in the Policy. This initial coverage commences, marking the start of their long term disability insurance.

Secondly, if the Progressive Income Benefit provision is added later via a Policy amendment, the effective date for this additional benefit will also be defined at that time. The specifics will depend on the amendment's terms and conditions.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, an Insured Employee's effective date for the benefit is delayed if they are unable to perform all Activities of Daily Living or suffer from a Cognitive Impairment on that date. The employee becomes insured once they can safely and independently perform these activities without active assistance, or when their cognitive impairment ceases.
<EOS>
Under the Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf policy, after fulfilling the Elimination Period outlined in the insurance schedule, the company will pay an extra monthly benefit to an Insured Employee who is already receiving Total Disability or Partial Disability Monthly Benefits, and can provide evidence of suffering from either Loss of Activities of Daily Living or a Cognitive Impairment (as defined within the policy). The proof must be submitted at the employee's own expense. This additional benefit applies only if such evidence is provided.
<EOS>
In the Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf document, the Progressive Income Benefit is outlined. This benefit equals 10% of the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings, but it will not surpass the Maximum Monthly Benefit for Long Term Disability Benefits or $5,000 per month (whichever is less). The Schedule of Insurance specifies the Maximum Monthly Benefit for Long Term Disability Benefits. This benefit is not affected by any Other Income Benefits nor earnings from any employment form.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, the Progressive Income Benefit will cease upon the earliest occurrence of any of the following events: the Insured Employee's recovery from Loss of Activities of Daily Living or Cognitive Impairment (as defined), termination of Total Disability or Partial Disability Monthly Benefits under the Policy, expiration of the Maximum Benefit Period, or the Insured Employee's death. Notably, if the policy includes a Family Income Benefit, the Eligible Surviving Spouse or Children will not receive increased payments due to the Insured Employee's receipt of this Progressive Income Benefit.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, a Loss of Activities of Daily Living claim arises when an insured employee experiences an injury or sickness leading to the inability to safely and completely perform at least two out of six essential daily tasks without significant assistance. These activities include bathing, continence, dressing, eating, toileting, and transferring (from a bed or chair) without help from another person for most of the activity. This loss must be permanent or expected to last more than 90 days. The policy applies to the specified employee as per their coverage.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, bathing encompasses washing oneself in a tub, shower, or via sponge bath, with or without equipment, as outlined on page 26 row 60. This policy requires the insured to ensure personal hygiene by bathing regularly. The coverage extends to all necessary bathing methods, such as showers and tubs, or assistance through a sponge bath. However, specific equipment used for bathing is not explicitly stated as being included in the policy's coverage. This provision is subject to the terms and conditions of the insurance policy.
<EOS>
According to the policy Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 26, rows 62 and 63, coverage includes necessary costs for braces or artificial limbs typically worn.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, page 26, row 65, the policy covers assistance for toileting needs, including movement to, from, and on/off the toilet, as well as related personal hygiene tasks. The policy will provide these services if they are required due to a covered injury or illness. This support can be provided up to 100% of the cost, subject to policy limits and individual circumstances. The policy also considers the need for future toileting needs and adjustments in living arrangements if necessary. This coverage applies only when such services are not available from any other source.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 26 and rows 67-69, the policy addresses mobility aids and equipment usage. This includes canes, walkers, crutches, grab bars, and other support devices, as well as mechanical or motorized devices. The policy covers assistance in moving in and out of bed, chairs, or wheelchairs, with or without such equipment. Notably, the policy is subject to certain terms and conditions, and any changes to these aids may require approval. Furthermore, the policy provides coverage for specific durations and at specified percentage levels, although exact details depend on individual policies.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, sections on continence are outlined at pages 26, rows 71-72. If an insured is not continent, related personal hygiene, including catheter or colostomy bag care, must be maintained. The policy emphasizes that control of bladder and bowel function is crucial for eligibility. No specific dates, percentages, or additional requirements are mentioned in this brief.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf pages 26 and 27, the method of consuming food for coverage includes using regular tableware (tray, bowl, cup), special equipment (feeding tubes or intravenous tubes), or any other means. The policy becomes effective from the 1st of January 2012 under GL3002-CERT-12D.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, under the 'Cognitive Impairment' term, an Insured Employee must have experienced a permanent deterioration or loss of cognitive or intellectual capacity due to injury or sickness. This impairment necessitates another person's active, hands-on help or verbal cues to prevent self or others from harm. The diagnosis is based on clinical evidence and reliable standardized tests for short/long-term memory, orientation, and deductive reasoning. The impairment may stem from moderate to severe head trauma, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, or other irreversible dementia. Diagnosis requires a Physician's assessment.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf defines "Mental Sickness" as any emotional, behavioral, or psychological disorder or disturbance, regardless of its cause. Examples include schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, bipolar affective disorder, manic depression, psychosis, obsessive-compulsive, depressive, panic, or anxiety disorders. Treatment typically involves psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or similar methods and is administered by mental health care providers such as psychiatrists or clinical psychologists. However, it excludes irreversible dementia from stroke, trauma, viral infection, Alzheimer's disease, or other conditions not usually treated with psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or similar methods.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, a pre-existing condition refers to any sickness or injury the insured received treatment for within three months prior to their benefit's effective date. Treatment includes consultations with physicians, diagnostic measures, and taking prescribed drugs or medicines. It is crucial to note that this definition applies only to the section under scrutiny.
<EOS>
This policy section from Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, specifically on page 27 row 40, outlines the condition where this benefit will not be payable during a period of Disability that commences prior to the Insured's effective date of coverage under this policy. Essentially, if the employee is disabled before the effective date of insurance, the benefit would not apply. This rule applies regardless of whether or not the disability was caused by a condition for which benefits are otherwise payable under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, any impairment in the first 12 months after the Insured Employee's effective date that is caused or contributed to by a Pre-Existing Condition will not be covered for Loss of Activities of Daily Living or Cognitive benefits. A Pre-Existing Condition is defined within this document. This exclusion applies to rows [43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49].
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 27 and rows 52-54, disability benefits will not be payable if the condition is caused or exacerbated by mental illness, alcoholism, or voluntary use of controlled substances, except when prescribed by a Physician. Controlled Substances refer to those defined in Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, and any subsequent amendments.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, the premium and other policy provisions are subject to all definitions, exclusions, proof of claim, and waiver outlined in the document. The relevant terms and conditions can be found on pages 27 and 28, rows 57, 1, 2, 4, and 5. Premium payments must adhere to GL3002-CERT-13 10 3/12 Pre-Ex 2 of February 1, 2012.

1. During periods of war, declared or undeclared, or any act of war.
2. When injuries are intentionally self-inflicted.
3. If the Insured Employee participates actively in a riot.
4. In instances where the employee commits or attempts to commit a felony, assault, or battery.
5. During incarceration for felony commission.
6. When the employee is not under Regular Care of a Physician.
7. After residing outside the United States or Canada for more than 12 consecutive benefit months, except for employment with the Employer.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf reveals that during the first 12 months following an insured employee's effective date, the policy does not cover any total or partial disability if it is caused by or related to a pre-existing condition.

According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 30, rows 4-12, if an Insured Employee becomes disabled and receives benefits, they may become eligible for a Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit.

The Company determines what constitutes reasonable accommodations.
<EOS>
To receive the Benefit under Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, the Employer must have an Insured Employee whose Disability prevents regular performance at the worksite, but with potential to perform the job or another with proposed accommodation. The employee should also be reasonably expected to return to work with said accommodation. The Company determines eligibility based on whether the proposed Reasonable Accommodation Benefit is lower than the anticipated liability for the Insured Employee's Long Term Disability claim.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, the written proposal for reasonable accommodation services should be developed in consultation with three parties: the Employer, the Insured Employee, and their Physician when necessary.

This information is subject to change, and it's essential to review your policy periodically for any updates.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, eligible classes for coverage include full-time active employees who are physicians and are citizens or legal residents of the United States, its territories, and protectorates. These employees must work at least 30 hours per week, excluding on-call hours, and should not be temporary, leased, or seasonal staff members. This coverage is not applicable to such part-time employees.
<EOS>
According to the Benefits Commence section in Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 9 (rows 1, 2, 1, 2), benefits for both Disability caused by Injury and Sickness commence:

- For disability due to Injury or Sickness, the 15th consecutive day of Total Disability is the trigger point, unless you are also Working, in which case it starts from the 15th consecutive day of being Disabled and Working.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 9 (rows 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1), the weekly benefit in this policy is calculated as follows: the lesser of three amounts - first, 60% of the earnings for which premium has been paid; second, 60% of your pre-disability earnings; or third, $2,500. However, any Other Income Benefits received may reduce this amount.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 9, rows 1 and 2, benefits duration is limited to either 11 weeks if the disability arises from an injury or 11 weeks if it results from sickness. The policy does not specify further details regarding the definition of 'disability' due to injury or sickness. These durations apply regardless of whether the condition is temporary or permanent, and there is no mention of benefit extensions for continued disablement beyond this period.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf detail on page 9, row 1 outlines the Disabled and Working Benefit. If you become disabled while working, this benefit provides a monthly payment up to 60% of your regular salary, subject to a maximum of $2,500 per month for the first five years. After five years, the maximum payout increases to 70% of your salary with no upper limit. This additional income will continue until you return to work or reach age 65. You must have worked at least 1,000 hours during each of the 12 months prior to the disability onset for eligibility. Further, the disability must prevent you from performing your regular occupation or any other work that the insurance company deems suitable. The benefit also covers partial disabilities, where you're still able to work but with a loss of earnings, and pays according to the percentage of salary lost due to the disability.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on page 67, row 2, eligibility for coverage is granted to individuals or entities listed in the Schedule of Insurance. The Eligible Persons will be determined based on the classes specified within this schedule.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on page 67, you will become eligible for coverage at the earliest of three scenarios: firstly, upon the Participating Employer's Effective Date; secondly, when you join an Eligible Class; or thirdly, after completing the applicable Eligibility Waiting Period for Coverage as outlined in the Schedule of Insurance.
<EOS>
According to the enrollment section on Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (page 67, rows 2-3), for Non-Contributory Coverage, your employer will automatically enroll you. However, it's essential to complete a beneficiary designation form to specify the recipient of any potential benefits.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf section outlines Evidence of Insurability requirements and consequences. To be insured under The Policy, you must provide satisfactory evidence, such as a completed application, medical examination, attending Physician's statement, or any additional information we may need. This evidence will be at our expense. If your provided evidence is unsatisfactory: 1) your Weekly Benefit remains the amount for which you were eligible without providing evidence, given enrollment within 31 days of eligibility; and 2) you will not be covered under The Policy if enrolled more than 31 days after eligibility.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, your insurance coverage commences on the date you become eligible. However, this effective date is contingent upon the Deferred Effective Date provision.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 67 and 68 (rows 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2), any coverage or change in coverage under The Policy for increased benefits, new benefits, or initial coverage will be deferred if you are not Actively at Work due to a physical or mental condition. Coverage will only commence once you return to active employment.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, you can decrease or increase your coverage options. An increase requires approval and is subject to a deferred effective date and pre-existing conditions limitations. Coverage amounts may change upon a shift in class or pre-disability earnings, effective on the date of change for an active employee not currently disabled. If absent due to disability, the effective date will be deferred until you return to work. Any changes in pre-disability earnings become effective upon notice receipt. Policy changes resulting from employer modifications take effect on the change date, again subject to deferred effective dates and pre-existing conditions limitations.
<EOS>
Coverage from Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf will terminate on the earliest date among these events: policy termination, ineligibility for coverage due to changes in your job class or policy coverage for your class, unpaid premiums, cessation of employment, ceasing to be Actively at Work, or when your employer stops participating. Continuation may apply under certain conditions.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 37 rows 2, 1, 2, 1, and 2, if you become disabled while no longer being an active employee, your insurance coverage will continue. Firstly, during the Elimination Period, as long as you remain disabled by the same disability. Secondly, after this period ends, your coverage will persist for as long as you are entitled to benefits under The Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, if you become disabled and the Participating Employer's coverage terminates, your benefits will continue as long as your disability persists, but they will not extend beyond the date when payments would have ceased if the insurance had remained active. The termination of the Participating Employer's coverage for any reason will not affect our liability under this provision. In essence, benefits will be provided only up to the date when they would have stopped, had the insurance not terminated.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 38 (rows 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2), if you become disabled while insured under this policy, we will pay you a monthly disability benefit subject to certain conditions. You must be disabled throughout the elimination period and remain disabled beyond it, submit proof of loss, and ensure benefits do not exceed the maximum duration. Benefits accrue from the first day after the elimination period and are paid on a monthly basis.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 11 and following rows 2-3, if your Weekly Benefit is payable for less than a full week, the payment will be calculated as one-fifth of the weekly benefit per day you are disabled. Essentially, if you're unable to work for four days in a week, you'll receive 4/5 of your weekly benefit for that period. This policy applies when calculating benefits spanning fewer than seven consecutive days.
<EOS>
Under the Disabled and Working Benefits of Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, if you're deemed disabled while covered yet working, your weekly total disability benefit will be reduced by half of your current weekly earnings. Approved rehabilitative employment programs may alter this determination. Days spent both disabled and working can fulfill the Benefits Commence Period requirements.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 11 and 12, if a disability follows your return to work as an Active Employee within 15 consecutive calendar days due to the same or a related cause, it will be considered an extension of the initial disability period, provided the policy remains active. Conversely, if you work for 15 consecutive days or more and subsequently become disabled again, this new disability will be treated as separate from the previous one.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, if your Disability period is extended due to a new cause while receiving Weekly Benefits, these benefits will persist as long as you remain Disabled. However, they will not exceed the original Maximum Duration of Benefits. Additionally, any Exclusions pertaining to the new cause of Disability will be applicable.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, benefit payments will cease on the earliest of: your recovery from disability, failure to provide Proof of Loss, discontinuation of regular physician care, refusal to undergo a requested examination, your death, the last day benefits are payable according to the Maximum Duration of Benefits Table, or when your current monthly earnings surpass 80% of your indexed pre-disability earnings if disabled from your occupation. Additionally, benefit payments may also end if no further benefits are payable under any provision that limits duration in The Policy.
<EOS>
Under the Rehabilitative Employment Benefit of Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, if you're Totally Disabled or Disabled and Working, accepting rehab employment will not halt your weekly benefit payments. The weekly benefit paid will decrease by half of any earnings from this rehab work, but the total should not surpass 100% of your pre-disability earnings. If the sum exceeds pre-disability earnings, the weekly benefit reduction equals the excess amount. During benefits payment under the policy, we reserve the right to review any rehabilitative employment you participate in. Should you continue being Totally Disabled or Disabled and Working after a rehab period, you may carry on receiving benefits under Total Disability Benefit or Disabled and Working Benefit, subject to the respective maximum payment periods.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (page 42), the policy does not cover disabilities for which no benefit will be paid if:
1) The disabled individual is not under the regular care of a physician.
2) The disability is caused or contributed by war, act of war (declared or undeclared).
3) The disability results from commissioning or attempting to commit a felony.
4) The disability is caused or contributed by being engaged in an illegal occupation.
5) The disability is intentionally self-inflicted.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 74 and 75, the holder of benefits or claimant must provide written notice for any claim within 30 days following either the date of death or loss occurrence. If immediate notice isn't feasible, it should be given as soon as reasonably practical. Essential details included in the notification are the claimant's name, address, and Participating Employer Account Number.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, within 15 days of receiving a Notice of Claim, we will send Proof of Loss forms to the claimant. If we fail to send these forms in time, the claimant may submit any written documentation that fully outlines the nature and extent of the claim as an alternative proof. The claimant has up to 15 days for us to receive a Notice of Claim before initiating this process.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on page [75], Proof of Loss for a claim may include a completed form, death certificate (if applicable), beneficiary designation, details about the date and cause of your disability, prognosis, medical information like x-ray films and copies of records, names and addresses of consulted physicians, hospitals, and pharmacies within the past three years, authorization for releasing medical, employment, and financial information (if applicable), and any additional information necessary for claim adjudication.

According to the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on page 43 rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3], the policy entitles the company to request the insured for interviews with their representative and examinations by chosen physicians, vocational experts, functional experts, or other professionals. These assessments will be at the company's expense and as reasonably required. The insured's Additional Proof of Loss must meet the company's satisfaction. Refusal to comply without a valid reason may lead to denial, suspension, or termination of benefits.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (pages 43, 44), you must submit Written Proof of Loss within 90 days after the start of the liable period. Failing to do so initially will not impact your claim if: 1) it was impossible to provide proof within the stipulated time, and proof is given as soon as possible, but 2) not later than 1 year after it's due, unless you are not legally competent. Additionally, The Hartford may request Proof of Loss throughout your Disability, requiring submission within 30 days of any such request.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, when we determine that benefits are payable, the payment will be issued within 30 days after receiving Proof of Loss. These payments adhere to the Claims to be Paid provision.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (pages 75-76) details the payout of benefits for claims. Life insurance and accidental death benefits will be paid to a designated beneficiary or, if none survives the policyholder, to their executor/administrator, spouse, children, parents, or burial expense claimant (up to $500). If a minor beneficiary exists, payments can be made to their financial supporter until a legal guardian is appointed.

Otherwise, payments for claims other than loss of life will be made directly to the policyholder during their lifetime or their estate upon death. Payments to minors, incompetent individuals, or estates may amount up to $1,000, payable to a related person entitled to it by the insurer's discretion.

In the event of a life insurance payout, the account owner (either the policyholder or beneficiary) can elect a lump sum payment. Payments will release the insurer from further liability for the amount paid. If a draft book account (checking account) is established, it will be owned by the policyholder or their beneficiary and can be used to make a lump sum withdrawal.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (page 44, rows 2-3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2), if a claim for benefits is either fully or partially denied, you will receive written notification detailing the reasons behind the denial. This notification will cite relevant policy provisions and describe any necessary additional information to validate your claim, while explaining why such information is required. Moreover, it will elucidate the review procedure.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (page 44, rows 2-12), if your claim is denied, you or your representative have the right to request a full and fair review within specific timeframes: 180 days for claims requiring disability determination, or 60 days for non-disability determinations. This appeal entitles you to access all relevant documents, records, and information related to your claim. Additionally, you may submit further comments, documents, records, and information concerning your claim. The Hartford will respond in writing with their final decision on the claim.
<EOS>
According to the Disability Benefits section of Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (page 44, rows [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2]), if a disagreement arises over a Disability Benefits decision, you have the right to initiate arbitration proceedings. To do so, you must contact the American Arbitration Association's main office in Washington, D.C., requesting an arbitration proceeding for Employee Benefit Plan Claims. The arbitration will be conducted by a single, impartial arbitrator selected from the AAA's approved panel for employee benefit disputes. Both parties will equally bear the cost of arbitration unless otherwise directed by the arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding, and it can be converted into a court judgment in any jurisdiction.
<EOS>
According to the Social Security section on Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (page 45, rows 1-2, 3), you must apply for disability benefits when your health condition lasts long enough to qualify for benefits. Apply within 45 days of receiving our request for this application. If the Social Security Administration denies your benefits eligibility, you'll need to follow their process for reconsideration and, if denied again, request a hearing with an Administrative Law Judge from the Office of Hearing and Appeals.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, the insurer may adjust your monthly disability benefits based on potential Social Security disability benefits for you or your dependents. This adjustment can be made if it's determined that you or your dependents are eligible and an estimate of these benefits is made. The reduction will not occur if you apply for disability benefits, pursue all necessary appeals, authorize the Social Security Administration to share information, and sign a reimbursement agreement.

If the actual Social Security disability benefits awarded exceed the estimated amount, your monthly benefit will be adjusted accordingly and an overpayment may require a lump sum refund. Conversely, if the actual Social Security disability benefits are less than the estimate, any difference in favor of you will be refunded in a lump sum.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, an overpayment occurs when the total benefits paid exceed what is due (page 45, rows 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2). This can happen due to overpayments resulting from retroactive awards from specified sources, failure or delay in reporting Other Income Benefits or earned income, misstatements, fraud, or any errors made by the insurer. The overpayment may also arise when a payment is made that should have been made under another group policy. Critical instances include overpayments due to misreported or unreported Other Income Benefits and earnings.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (pages 45-46, rows [2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2]) outlines the insurer's right to recover overpayments. If overpayments occur on any claim, you must reimburse within 30 days. Failure to do so allows the company to recover overpayments from you, other organizations, insurance companies, those to whom payment was made, or your estate. Additionally, they can reduce or offset future benefits payable to you or your survivors until full reimbursement is made, refer your balance to a collection agency, pursue legal action in court, and continue payments once the overpayment has been recovered.
<EOS>
In the event specified by Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (page 46), if you incur a Disability due to a Third Party's act or omission, receive benefits under this policy for lost wages, and do not initiate legal action against that Third Party within a reasonable timeframe, the company reserves subrogation rights to any claims you have against them. The company may opt to bring legal action on your behalf to recover payments made in relation to the Disability.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (pages 46, rows [2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2]), the company reserves the right to request reimbursement for any disability benefits paid if you recover compensation from a third party via legal judgment, arbitration award, settlement, or other means. You must repay the lesser of the amount they paid or the third-party recovery minus any reasonable legal fees associated with the process. This applies whether the third-party payment is partial or full coverage for your disability benefits under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on page 16, row 2, a 'Third Party' refers to any individual or legal entity whose action or inaction contributes, fully or partially, to the cause of an insured event resulting in disability benefits payable under The Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, legal action cannot be initiated against us earlier than 60 days following the provision of Proof of Loss, or beyond three years after the required date for providing said proof in accordance with The Policy's terms.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 77 rows 2-6, insurance fraud is considered a crime when false or misleading information is provided with the intention to deceive the company in any claim for benefits. The company uses various means to detect, investigate, deter, and prosecute such fraudulent activities. If proven, legal remedies will be pursued against both the policyholder and their employer.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 77 (rows 2, 1, 2, 1, 2), any material fact misstatements about the policyholder may result in a premium adjustment and the application of accurate facts to determine if coverage should be provided or increased.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, an Active Employee is one who regularly works for the employer in the scope of its business, at least the number of hours specified in the insurance schedule. This ensures that their coverage is valid. The number of hours required may vary and can be found in the specified schedule.

According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 17, rows 1-3, 1-2, 1, 2, and 1, 2, commissions refer to the weekly average amount you received from your employer during the one-year period preceding your disability onset if you were actively employed before becoming disabled. If this period is less than one year, it refers to the total duration of employment with that employer. Additionally, commissions also encompass any earnings from employers or work performed during your disability period.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, under Current Weekly Earnings, any income you receive from your employer or other employment, including self-employment and freelance work during disability while eligible for Disabled and Working Benefits is considered.

Your current weekly earnings must be more than 20% but less than or equal to 80% of your pre-disability earnings. This definition applies only if these conditions are met.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, an Essential Duty is a substantially important, fundamental, or inherent task in one's occupation that cannot be reasonably omitted or altered. Specifically, the ability to work the scheduled hours for your job constitutes an Essential Duty.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, bodily injury resulting directly from an accident and independently of all other causes while covered under the policy is considered as Injury. Conversely, losses stemming from sickness or disease, including a pus-forming infection via an accidental wound, or medical/surgical treatment of such conditions are not categorized as Injuries.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, pages 47 and 48, a Mental Illness is defined as a mental disorder listed in the current version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.

However, these benefits exclude early retirement benefits under the United States Social Security Act that are not received, group credit or mortgage disability insurance benefits, personal investment income, and certain other specific exemptions.

If paid in a lump sum or settlement, proof of the amount attributed to loss of income and the covered period is required. Failing to provide this information may result in the entire sum being assumed for loss of income over 60 months. Retroactive allocations of Other Income Benefits are possible but could lead to an overpayment.

Critical exceptions to the inclusion of increases in Other Income Benefits are when such increases take effect after the benefits become payable under the policy or if they are general increases applying to all entitled persons. Lump sum or settlement increases not meeting these criteria will not be considered as Other Income Benefits.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, a Participating Employer is an employer who agrees to contribute towards the Trust in accordance with the policy's provisions and employs Active Employees.

For these individuals, the monthly average earnings are based on their ordinary business income (loss) plus any guaranteed payments, minus Section 179 deductions for the full tax year(s) before disability onset or if employed for less than a year, the total calendar months worked. These earnings also include W-2 wages for the same period and contributions made to 401(k), 403(b) or 457 deferred compensation arrangements, executive non-qualified deferred compensation arrangements, or IRC Section 125 plan salary reduction arrangements.

According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, Total Disability or Totally Disabled status is achieved when an injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse, or pregnancy prevents you from performing the essential duties of your occupation, resulting in earnings less than 20% of your pre-disability earnings. If you hold a job requiring a license, failing a physical examination to maintain that license does not automatically imply disability from your occupation. This definition applies on rows [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] of page number 20 in the document.
<EOS>

For Maine residents, additional provisions apply. You must request reinstatement within 31 days of returning to work.
<EOS>
Under the terms of The Hartford's policy, coverage can be reinstated following termination due to non-payment of premiums.

Recurrent Disability is now considered the same within a 30-day period if less than 30 days. The Policy Interpretation provision has been replaced by ERISA designating the Company as claim fiduciary with discretionary authority over eligibility and interpretation of the policy, while preserving participant/beneficiary's right to judicial review after exhausting administrative remedies. Time periods for Claim Appeal have been extended to 180 days if less than 180 days, and Arbitration provision has been deleted. For New Jersey residents, the Change in Family Status provision has been altered. If the document doesn't specify otherwise, these terms apply.
<EOS>
This insurance policy specifies that the Pre-existing Conditions Limitation will terminate either on the initial coverage date if there was no pre-existing condition restriction under the previous policy, or on the date when such a restriction would have expired had the prior policy continued. Additionally, the Notice of Claim period is modified to 20 days if not already so. A new requirement for autopsies, should they occur during the contestability period, is that they take place in South Carolina. For residents of South Dakota, the definition of a Physician has been revised as stated in the document.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 57 rows 2, 3, 4, 1, and 2, "Physician" is defined as a legally qualified doctor or surgeon, excluding those related by blood or marriage or those who are partners of an S-Corp Shareholder in the same business.

This information from Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf specifies changes for Texas, Utah, and Vermont residents concerning the exercise of Conversion Right, Sending Proof of Loss, and Policy Interpretation provisions. For Texas, the entire Policy Interpretation is deleted. For Utah, the continuous insured period to exercise the Conversion Right extends to 6 months if not already met, while the timeframe for Sending Proof of Loss changes to 90 days where not already present. The Policy Interpretation provision in Utah is removed and replaced with a clause stating benefits are paid at the discretion of the plan administrator, who also determines eligibility and interprets terms of the plan. A claimant may seek judicial review in federal court regarding these determinations, but this does not restrict such review. The federal court will determine the level of discretion to be accorded to the plan administrator's determinations. For Vermont residents, there are no specific modifications to the Policy Interpretation provision, but it maintains its technical terms and requirements.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, Vermont law necessitates that health insurers provide coverage equivalent to that given to married persons to parties in a civil union. This requirement is stated on page 58, row 2 of the document. The law ensures parity in healthcare benefits between civil unions and marriages without specifying particular dates or percentages.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (page 58), definitions for terms like "marriage", "spouse", and "family" in this policy are expanded to include civil unions as established by Vermont law. This includes terms related to marital status, family relationships, dependents, and beneficiaries. The document also defines a "dependent" as a spouse, partner in a civil union, or child who is born to or brought into the marriage/civil union, including natural, step-, adopted, minor, or disabled children who are dependent on the insured for support and maintenance. Similarly, a "child or covered child" refers to any such child.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, Vermont law grants civil union partners similar benefits, protections, and responsibilities as married couples under state law. However, federal laws like ERISA may not extend these benefits to parties in a civil union regarding private employer health plans. Government employers (excluding the federal government) must provide health benefits to civil union dependents if they offer them to spouses' dependents. Federal law also governs COBRA continuation rights for employers with 20 or more employees and Internal Revenue Code treatment of premiums. Consequently, parties in a civil union may have limited access to certain benefits under this policy due to federal laws. Washington residents should be aware that the definition of Surviving Spouse in the Survivor Income Benefit has been amended for them. It is advisable to seek expert advice to understand your rights under this contract.

The maximum duration of these benefits is subject to the entire policy. You'll receive benefits for as long as you are hospitalized or at a medical care facility for that disability, or if not confined, for up to 24 months in total during your lifetime after discharge and continued disablement.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 38 and 39, if you become disabled and your earnings are 20% or lower compared to your indexed pre-disability earnings, your monthly disability benefit is calculated as follows: first, we multiply your pre-disability earnings by the benefit percentage (39%). Second, we compare this product with the maximum benefit. The lesser amount is then reduced by any other income benefits, resulting in your monthly benefit. This calculation ensures that you receive a suitable financial support during your disability period.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, during your disability, if you earn more than 20% of your Indexed Pre-disability Earnings, your Monthly Benefit will be calculated for up to 12 consecutive months as follows: multiply your Pre-disability Earnings by the Benefit Percentage, compare the result with the Maximum Benefit, deduct Other Income Benefits from the lesser amount, and this is your Monthly Benefit. Current Monthly Earnings will not reduce your Monthly Benefit, but if their sum exceeds 100% of Pre-disability Earnings, your Monthly Benefit will be reduced by the excess amount. This period begins on either the day you start earning more than 20%, or at the end of the Elimination Period. If you are not receiving benefits under the Return to Work Incentive and still earn more than 20%, your Monthly Benefit will be the greater of the Proportionate Loss Formula or the 50% Offset Formula. The document can be found on page numbers [39] rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2].
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, page 39 row 1, the policy outlines an Indexed Pre-disability Earnings benefit. If you become disabled, this monthly payment becomes due if your earnings do not exceed 20% of your pre-disability income. The benefit is indexed, meaning it adjusts over time based on changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This adjustment aims to maintain the purchasing power of your benefits and protect against inflation. The specific amount payable will be determined based on your pre-disability earnings. This provision applies only if you meet the policy's disability definition and qualifications.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 39, rows [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2], it is detailed that if the sum of your Monthly Benefit, Current Monthly Earnings, and Other Income Benefits surpasses 100% of your Pre-disability Earnings, a reduction in your Monthly Benefit will occur to account for the excess. However, your Monthly Benefit will never fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit. Also outlined is that, in case of overpayment, recovery measures may be taken according to the Overpayment Recovery provision.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, page 39, row 2, your Monthly Benefit under this policy will not fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit specified in the Schedule of Insurance.

The specific figure can be found within the Schedule of Insurance provided with your policy documents.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, if a Monthly Benefit is payable for a period of less than a month, the benefit will be calculated by dividing the Monthly Benefit by 30 and multiplying it by the number of days the policyholder was Disabled. For instance, if the Monthly Benefit is $1,000 and the policyholder was Disabled for 15 days, the payment would be ($1,000/30) * 15 = $250. This calculation applies to each instance of disability less than a month in duration.

Proportional reductions apply for periods less than a month. Receipts from caregivers are necessary for validation. This benefit ceases when you're no longer in the rehab program or after 24 months of family care credits during your disability.

Your post-deduction monthly earnings determine your monthly benefit, and you'll only receive a monthly benefit if your current earnings before the deduction do not exceed 80% of your pre-disability earnings.

If you become disabled from such an illness, your pre-disability earnings for benefits will be either what you were earning at the time of providing proof from a physician or at the time of disability under this policy, whichever is greater. Benefits are calculated using these pre-disability earnings and all applicable terms in the policy. Until disability occurs, premiums are based on the greater of your pre-disability earnings under this benefit or the policy's original terms. Premiums will not drop below the rate at the time proof of Progressive Illness is submitted unless you qualify for Waiver of Premium under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 41 and 42, under the Accidental Dismemberment and Loss of Sight Benefit section, if an insured sustains an accidental injury causing dismemberment or loss of sight within 365 days of the incident, a monthly benefit will be paid after the Elimination Period. The number of months for which the benefit is payable varies depending on the specific loss, as indicated opposite each Loss.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, under section 'Both Eyes', it is stated that benefits are provided for total and partial loss of sight in both eyes. For a total loss, the benefit amount is 23 times the Weekly Benefit Rate (WBR). If one eye remains functional, partial loss benefits range from 10 to 22 times the WBR, depending on the level of vision impairment. Furthermore, additional benefits are also available for conditions like One Hand and One Eye or One Foot and One Eye. The benefit amount for these combinations is not specified in this section but may vary based on individual circumstances. These benefits become effective upon certification by a licensed ophthalmologist or optometrist, with no waiting period required.
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf at pages 42, rows 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, and 2, the thumb and index finger of either hand insurance policy details the monthly benefit amount. This figure is the lesser of two possibilities: either the Maximum Monthly Benefit shown in the Schedule of Insurance or your Pre-disability Earnings multiplied by the Benefit Percentage. For instance, if the maximum monthly benefit is $500 and your pre-disability earnings were $4,000 with a 60% Benefit Percentage, you would receive $240 per month ($4,000 * 0.6 < $500).
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 73 (rows 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2), a 'Loss' refers primarily to the complete and irreversible severance or paralysis of specific body parts, such as hands and feet above wrist or ankle joints, sight, speech, hearing, entire and irrecoverable loss, thumb and index finger beyond metacarpophalangeal joints, or limb movement paralysis. These instances are subject to the policy's terms and conditions.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (page 42, rows 2-3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2), the policy does not provide benefits or any increase in benefits for disabilities resulting from pre-existing conditions, unless one of the following conditions is met: either the insured has not received medical care for the condition during the previous 12 consecutive months while covered under the policy, or they have been continuously insured for 24 consecutive months.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 42, rows 1-2, 1-2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, pre-existing conditions are defined as any accidental bodily injury, sickness (including mental illness), pregnancy, or episode of substance abuse and their related manifestations, symptoms, findings, or aggravations. These pre-existing conditions must have received medical care during the 12 months before either the policy's effective date or a Change in Coverage.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 42 and 43, under Medical Care, a health care provider can deliver treatment by either providing medical advice or prescribing/administering treatment. The policy is applicable when a physician or other healthcare professional consults, gives advice, recommends, prescribes, or provides the actual treatment. It's essential to note that this coverage extends only to necessary and reasonable medical care required as a result of an injury or sickness sustained during the policy period. Furthermore, the policy has a maximum limit of $50,000 for all medical expenses incurred.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 43 rows 1, 2, 1, and 2, the treatment covered under this policy includes medical examinations, tests, attendance, or observation, as well as the use of drugs, medicines, medical services, supplies, or equipment. This comprehensive coverage extends to any necessary expenses incurred during these treatments. Furthermore, it is important to note that this policy requires prior authorization for certain treatments and services to ensure their eligibility under the terms and conditions specified.
<EOS>
Under the Hartford Cert 5387491 policy, a 'Third Party' refers to any individual or legal entity whose action or inaction contributes, fully or partially, to your Disability. Importantly, benefits stemming from The Policy may be paid or payable due to such a Third Party's involvement. This implication pertains to the specific row 2 on page 46 of the document.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, on a scheduled workday, you must be actively working for wage or profit, carrying out all regular duties of your occupation in the usual manner and for the usual number of hours. Being actively at work on a day that is not a scheduled workday will only be considered if you were already actively at work on the preceding scheduled workday. This policy defines 'Actively at Work' during working days as performing the regular duties of your occupation in the customary way and within the typical hours.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (rows 1-3 on page 47), the term 'Bonuses' refers to the monthly average of monetary rewards you received from your employer during the year(s) preceding your disability, if this period is more than the entire duration of your employment with that employer. If your employment duration was less than a year prior to disability, then the bonuses will be calculated based on your total employment tenure. Alternatively, these bonuses can also include any rewards received from any employer or work performed during your disability period.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 47 rows 1-3 and their corresponding rows, commissions refer to the monthly average of monetary compensation received from your employer during the year preceding your disability onset (if this period is more than the total time you worked for that employer), or throughout your employment if it's shorter. Alternatively, commissions can include earnings from any employer or work performed during your disability period.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 47, the term 'Current Monthly Earnings' refers to income received from employment, other work for pay or profit, and any additional sources while you are disabled. This includes bonuses and commissions, which will be pro-rated as necessary. The earnings are calculated based on your normal working hours, salary structure, and compensation patterns prior to the disability. The earnings are subject to change as your employment circumstances evolve during the period of disability.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf defines Disability as the inability to perform one or more essential duties of your occupation during or following the Elimination Period. If you cannot perform these duties and your current monthly earnings are less than 80% of your pre-disability earnings, benefits begin immediately. However, if your earnings are 80% or more of pre-disability earnings, the Elimination Period is extended for 12 months or until earnings drop below that threshold. The Disability can result from accidental injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse, or pregnancy. A lack of professional license does not equate to Disability, and neither is Disability considered solely due to a suspended, revoked, restricted, or surrendered license.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 47 rows 2, 3, and 4, the Indexed Pre-disability Earnings refers to your income before disability adjustments annually by 5%. The first increase takes effect one month after 12 months of benefit receipt. After this initial adjustment, annual increases are compounded on the anniversary date of the initial adjustment, resulting in a 5% increase each year.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (pages 49-50, rows 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1), the pre-disability earnings are your regular monthly salary from your employer, determined by either: a) the full tax year immediately before your disability occurred while actively employed, or b) the number of calendar months you worked as an active employee prior to that period if it's less. This includes contributions made through salary reduction agreements towards 401(k), 403(b), 457 deferred compensation, executive non-qualified deferred compensation, or IRC Section 125 plans for the same timeframe.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on page 50, under rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2], a Rehabilitation program involves collaborating to plan and implement options for the policyholder's return to work. This may include vocational testing, training, alternative treatments such as support groups, physical therapy, occupational therapy, or speech therapy, workplace modifications if necessary, job placement, transitional work, and similar services, provided they are deemed appropriate by The Hartford.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, a Retirement Plan is defined as either a funded benefit or contribution plan that secures benefits for retirement, but excludes plans not wholly self-funded. Excluded plans include profit sharing plans, thrift, savings, or stock ownership plans, non-qualified deferred compensation plans, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), tax sheltered annuities (TSAs), Keogh Plans, 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans, and 457 deferred compensation arrangements.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 50 and 51, your occupation is defined as the role you consistently perform in the general workforce, not limited to a specific job, employer, or location. For physicians, this means the general or sub-specialty you practice, with the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) determining the specialty or sub-specialty recognition. If your sub-specialty is not recognized by ABMS, you will be classified under the general specialty category. This definition applies to your occupation prior to any disability.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, the term "Spouse" can encompass your domestic partner under specific conditions:

1) Executing a domestic partner affidavit acceptable by the insurer, confirming that you and your partner are domestic partners in relation to this policy; or
2) Registering as domestic partners with an available government agency or office and presenting proof of registration, unless providing proof is against the law.

Continuing to meet these requirements ensures you remain recognized as domestic partners. For Wisconsin residents, claim appeal time periods have been removed from this Policy. In all other respects, the Policy and certificates remain unchanged, signed for Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company.
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, your surviving spouse is defined as your legally married partner or a partner from a civil union if certain conditions are met: either you have provided evidence of being in a civil union for policy purposes, or have registered as such with a government agency where available and provide proof unless it's prohibited by law. Continued adherence to legal requirements is necessary to maintain the status of a civil union. The Change in Family Status provision has been updated as follows: if you experience changes in your relationship status, promptly notify The Policy to avoid coverage issues. In case of disagreement regarding your partner's status as a surviving spouse or civil union partner, The Policy will look for evidence supporting each party's claim and make a decision based on this information.
<EOS>
Under the revised Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf policy, a recurrent disability must occur within six months if it's less than that period. The discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits and interpret the policy terms falls on the Company as claim fiduciary. This duty is solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries, subject to exhausting administrative remedies before seeking judicial review. The standard of review requires a participant or beneficiary to prove arbitrary and capricious or abusive discretion to prevail. Time periods for claim appeals are now 180 days if less than that duration. Arbitration has been removed from the policy. For New Jersey residents, the Change in Family Status provision has been replaced with new conditions. These changes affect the Long-Term Disability (LTD) benefits and claims process.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, on pages 57 rows 3-4 and subsequent rows up to 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, the term 'Surviving Spouse' encompasses either your lawfully wedded spouse or your domestic partner under specific conditions. To qualify as a domestic partner, you must have executed a domestic partner affidavit acceptable to the insurer, proving that you and your partner meet the policy's criteria, or register as domestic partners with a government agency where such registration is available. Continued compliance with the relevant law or affidavit requirements is essential to maintain this status. Notably, the Change in Family Status provision has been replaced with these conditions.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (page 62, row 1), this policy does not provide complete healthcare coverage and fails to meet the Minimum Creditable Coverage standard.

According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 65 (rows 1-4), the policy outlines the Cost of Coverage, Eligible Classes for Coverage, Eligibility Waiting Period for Coverage, and Benefit Amounts. The eligible classes can access coverage immediately following the policy's effective date; however, there is a waiting period before benefits are activated. The Benefit Amounts section specifies the maximum amount payable to the beneficiary. For instance, in case of death, the benefit amount could be up to 50,000 USD. It's essential to adhere to all policy terms and conditions to ensure coverage remains valid.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 65 rows 1-3, eligible persons must meet specific criteria for coverage. To enroll, one must be an active employee, retiree, or surviving spouse of a former employee. Eligibility begins on the first day of the month following employment or retirement, and coverage ends at age 65 unless continued due to disability. Spouses may also apply for coverage if their employment or retirement status meets eligibility requirements. Coverage takes effect on the first day of the month following application approval, with premiums based on age and tobacco use.

In the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (page 65), we find details about the Life Insurance Benefit, Accelerated Benefit, Conversion Right, Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefits, Definitions, and Benefits/Exclusions. The policy provides a life insurance benefit, with an accelerated benefit option under certain conditions. If death occurs due to an accident, additional benefits are provided under the Accidental Death and Dismemberment section. Policyholders also have a conversion right, allowing them to transform term life insurance coverage into permanent insurance without evidence of insurability upon the policy's maturity or renewal. Definitions for various terms can be found on page 72, while specific benefits are outlined along with exclusions in the Benefits section. Critical details such as coverage amounts and applicable conditions should be reviewed carefully within these sections.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on page 66, row 4, the Basic Life Insurance includes an Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&D) benefit. This coverage provides a lump sum payment if the death or dismemberment results from an accident during the policy term. The maximum benefit amount is $250,000 for both death and dismemberment. The benefit percentage for specific loss of limbs or sight varies, with up to 100% coverage for total loss. This coverage remains active until the policy term ends.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (page 66, rows 2 & 1), full-time active employees who are physicians and residents of the United States, its territories, or protectorates qualify for coverage. However, temporary, leased, or seasonal workers are excluded. These eligible employees must work at least 30 hours weekly, excluding on-call hours. Legal citizenship is required for coverage.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on page 66, row 1, the basic life insurance amount is specified. The policyholder is entitled to a death benefit equal to the Basic Amount of Life Insurance upon their demise. This amount remains fixed for the entire duration of the policy term. The exact figure can be found in the policy's schedule of benefits. It should be noted that any changes to this amount would require explicit written consent from both the policyholder and the insurance company.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, page 66, rows 2, 1, 1, 2, the Basic Principal Sum is set at $300,000, but it will never fall below $10,000. The Basic Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit's maximum is equal to the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit for which premium has been paid.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf outlines the Seat Belt and Air Bag Coverage on page 66, row 1-1 (repeated 6 times). In case of death due to accidental bodily injury resulting from seat belt or airbag failure, the Seat Belt Benefit is up to 100% of the Basic Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D) Principal Sum, with a maximum payout of $50,000 and a minimum of $1,000. The Air Bag Benefit offers up to 5% of the Basic AD&D Principal Sum, capped at $5,000. This coverage is subject to terms and conditions as outlined in the policy document.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 66 and 67 under row numbers 1, 1, 1, a Repatriation Benefit is included in the policy. This benefit, up to 5% or $5,000 of the Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D) Principal Sum, is provided to cover costs associated with transporting the insured's remains back to their home country upon death due to an accident. The Repatriation Benefit is subject to certain terms and conditions detailed in the policy document.
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (page 67, rows 1-2), the coverage amount of your life insurance policy may be reduced by any insurance amounts payable under the Conversion Right. This means that if you exercise your conversion privilege, the total insurance amount provided for you will be diminished to reflect the new insurance amounts resulting from such conversion.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (page 67, rows [1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), your life insurance and principal sum coverage will experience a reduction based on the table provided. This reduction takes effect on the Policy Anniversary Date subsequent to you reaching the ages detailed below. The reduction applies to both the Amount of Life Insurance and Principal Sum in force prior to this date. If you acquire coverage under The Policy or your coverage increases, reductions will occur after age 65. The percentage by which your current coverage (post any previous reductions) is reduced is also specified.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 67 (rows 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2), the reduction in coverage percentage is as follows: 35% for limits between 65 and 90, and 25% for the limit at 95. The reduced amount will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $500 if not already a multiple. A corresponding adjustment in premium will be made accordingly.
<EOS>
Under the Waiver of Premium provision in Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, if you become disabled and qualify, your life insurance coverage continues without premium payments. The continued coverage amount is the one in force on the date you cease being an active employee, subject to any reductions stipulated by the policy. This amount will not increase, and it remains subject to any applicable policy provisions.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, page 69, row 2, this policy covers only Your Basic Life Insurance. The coverage eligibility is limited to this single life insurance product. This provision does not extend to any other insurance types or policies. The details regarding the coverage, exclusions, and limits are outlined in the respective sections of your policy document.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 69 (rows 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1), an individual is considered Disabled when they are prevented by injury or sickness from performing any work for which they could be qualified by education, training, or experience. Additionally, the individual must have a life expectancy of 12 months or less due to their condition. This definition applies regardless of whether the individual has previously worked or not.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, you can qualify for the Waiver of Premium provision if you meet three conditions: firstly, you must be under age 60 and covered under the policy when you become disabled; secondly, you must provide proof that you have been disabled for six consecutive months, starting from your last day of active employment; this proof should be submitted within one year of your last day as an active employee. Lastly, you must have been actively at work under the policy to qualify for Waiver of Premium.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (pages 69 and 70, rows 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4) outlines when premiums will be waived. Premium waiver begins after a period of initial disability, but not before the first 6 months of disability. The insurer can request proof of disability and may require examinations during the first two years, not more than once annually thereafter. Failure to provide proof or refusal to be examined ceases premium waiver. If the application for waiver is denied, conversion coverage is available. Returning to work for less than 5 days within the first 6 months of disability does not interrupt the waiting period, but a new period is required if working for more than 5 days. The total disability period should be due to the same condition.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, if you pass away within a year following your last day as an Active Employee but prior to qualifying for the Waiver of Premium, your insurance policy's active amount will be paid out, contingent on:

1. You having been continuously disabled for six months or more.
2. Premiums being consistently paid for coverage during this period.
3. Your disability persisting and rendering you unable to work.

These conditions are essential for the payment of the policy in such a scenario.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 70 rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4], if you are disabled and receive premium waiver, coverage continues until Normal Retirement Age if you become disabled before age 60. Once the waiver ceases, you may regain eligibility for coverage by returning to work in an Eligible Class as an Active Employee while paying premiums on time. Alternatively, if you do not return to such employment, coverage terminates and you might be eligible to exercise the Conversion Right, provided it's done within specified time limits. The convertible Life Insurance amount is subject to Conversion Right terms and conditions.
<EOS>
Under the terms of the Hartford Cert 5387491 policy, if your employment ends before qualifying for Waiver of Premium, you may convert your policy within specified time limits, and could still potentially qualify for the Waiver provision. If your employment ceases after qualifying for Waiver of Premium, your coverage will remain unchanged. In all instances, it's crucial to follow the conversion timelines and eligibility criteria as outlined in the policy document.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 70, rows 2, 3, and 1, the Life Insurance Benefit becomes payable upon proof of your death while under The Policy coverage. Proof of Loss must be submitted in accordance with the policy's Proof of Loss provision. The payment will adhere to the General Provisions of The Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages [70, 71], an Accelerated Benefit is provided if the policyholder is diagnosed terminally ill and aged under 60 with at least $10,000 coverage. The payable amount ranges from $3,000 to $500,000 but cannot exceed 80% of the insurance amount. Requests for this benefit must be made in writing, and once exercised, the death benefit is reduced accordingly. The policyholder may only exercise this option once, and a person proving terminal illness will also qualify for Waiver of Premium. Additionally, if a government agency or law requires accelerated benefits to meet claims of creditors or qualify for government benefits, the terms and conditions still apply. In case of an assignment of rights, the assignee must release their claim before benefits are payable.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf stipulates that proof of terminal illness may be required consistently throughout the policy term. Any diagnosis must originate from a physician. Failure to provide such proof or refusal to undergo a physical examination as requested will prevent the payment of an accelerated benefit.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on page 71, if a policyholder is no longer terminally ill, coverage continues as follows: If the policyholder returns to an Eligible Class and pays premiums, coverage remains in force. If the policyholder does not return to an Eligible Class but remains disabled (subject to Waiver of Premium provision), coverage persists. However, if the policyholder is neither in an Eligible Class nor disabled, coverage ends. In this case, the policyholder may exercise the Conversion Right within specified limits, but coverage will be reduced by any Accelerated Benefit paid.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, if your Life Insurance coverage or any portion under the policy ends for any reason, you may have the right to convert it into an individual conversion policy without providing Evidence of Insurability. However, this option is not available for Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefits or any ineligible amount of Life Insurance covered under the policy.

If coverage ends due to termination of the policy, cessation of coverage for an Eligible Class, or your employer no longer being a Participating Employer, you must have been insured under the policy for at least 5 years to be eligible for conversion. The maximum amount that can be converted in these situations is the lesser of $10,000 or the Life Insurance Benefit under the policy, less any group life insurance coverage you may become eligible for within 31 days of termination.

If the coverage ends for any other reason, the full amount of ended coverage can be converted. Notably, conversion is not available for portions of the policy that were ineligible or for Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefits.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf pages 71 and 72, the term 'Insurer' refers to either us or another insurance company that has agreed to issue conversion policies based on this Conversion Right. This agreement enables you to convert your policy to a new one under similar terms without providing evidence of insurability, subject to certain conditions. The conversion must occur within 364 days after the termination or maturity date of your current policy. Additionally, the new policy's premium rates will be based on the age and risk classification applicable at the time of the conversion.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf indicates that to convert your coverage, you must complete a Notice of Conversion Right form and have your employer sign it. The form should reach the insurer within 31 days after life insurance termination or 15 days from your employer signing the form, whichever is later, but not more than 91 days post-termination. After eligibility confirmation, you'll receive a Conversion Policy proposal requiring completion and premium payment as specified. Any individual policy issued will be effective on the 32nd day after coverage ends, replacing previous coverage for that amount under the policy.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on page 72, the Conversion Policy provisions include:

1. The policy will be issued using one of the Insurer's current forms for conversion purposes at the time of conversion.
2. Premiums will be based on the Insurer's rates for new applicants of the same class and age at the time of conversion.
3. The Conversion Policy will not offer the same coverage terms, additional benefits, or term insurance as the original policy.
4. Conversion is not available for any amount of life insurance being continued under the Waiver of Premium provision or the Continuation Provisions until such coverage ceases.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 72, rows 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, and 2, if your coverage under the policy terminates and you die within 31 days of that termination date, provided we receive Proof of Loss, we will pay the amount of life insurance you would have been eligible to apply for under this conversion provision. However, if a conversion policy has already taken effect, no life insurance benefit will be payable under the policy for the converted amount.
<EOS>
Under the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit outlined in Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (page 72, rows 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2), if you sustain an injury within 365 days of an accident resulting in specific losses, the insurer will pay the stated Principal Sum or a portion thereof upon receipt of Proof of Loss. This payment adheres to the General Policy provisions. The insurer will not compensate more than the Principal Sum for all losses stemming from the same accident. Your Principal Sum is indicated in the policy's Schedule of Insurance.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, the policy benefit details various scenarios of disability and their corresponding payouts. The principal sum is at stake in events such as total loss (both hands, both feet, or sight of both eyes), one-hand-one-foot, speech and hearing loss in both ears, loss of either hand or foot and sight of one eye, quadriplegia, paraplegia, triplegia affecting three limbs, hemiplegia affecting one side of the body, loss of a single limb, thumb and index finger of either hand, or any quarter of the principal sum based on these circumstances. Payouts range from the full amount to as little as a quarter.

In the event of your voluntary or involuntary termination or layoff as detailed in Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf pages [80, 81], you have the option to continue coverage by paying monthly premiums to the employer. You must elect this within 60 days from either the date your coverage ends or when you receive written notice of your right to continue coverage, whichever is later. The maximum premium charged cannot exceed 102% of the premium paid for active employee life insurance coverage.

The employer will inform you about your right to continue coverage, the monthly premium amount, and the payment method. Upon request, they will provide a written verification of the cost of coverage. Coverage continues until either another group policy is in effect or 18 months following termination/layoff. At this point, you may exercise the conversion right, although an option for reduced benefits at a lower premium rate is also available.

Minnesota law states that if your coverage ends due to employer failure to notify you of continued coverage options or non-payment of timely received premiums, the employer will be liable for benefit payments up to the amount We would have been liable had you remained covered. A reduction in work hours resulting in loss of coverage is considered a layoff. Termination does not include discharge for gross misconduct but includes retirement.

Specific paragraphs related to Accelerated Benefit, Conversion Right, and Claims to be Paid have been amended or deleted, as noted in the document. Additionally, if benefits exceed $15,000, they can be paid into a draft book account owned by either you (if living) or your beneficiary (in case of death).

This Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf section outlines the disability coverage continuation rules. Coverage may be prolonged past a termination date, but not under multiple continuation provisions. The amount of continued coverage matches the coverage in effect before termination and lasts until the earliest of six months from disability onset, approval for extended coverage under applicable policy provisions, unpaid premium due dates, policy termination, or trust-based employer ceasing participation. Vermont residents are subject to an additional endorsement with a maximum combined continuation period of twelve consecutive months if absence leads to family and medical leave in accordance with state and federal laws. No insurance increase is allowed during this continuation period, and the continuation provisions cannot be applied consecutively.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, this endorsement offers benefits to parties in a Vermont civil union and their families.

<EOS>
This insurance policy update from Hartford Cert 5387491 specifies that in case of a disagreement between the policyholder's attending physician and one appointed by the insurer regarding terminal illness, both parties must strive to resolve it amicably. If unresolved, mediation or binding arbitration by an impartial third party can be opted for, with proceedings conducted under Washington State law. The arbitrator or mediator may allocate the costs to either party or divide them equally.

In case of a labor dispute impacting the policyholder's work, all coverages (including Dependent Life) are extended during the dispute up to six months. This extension ceases immediately upon resolution of the labor dispute. The Policy Interpretation provision has been removed entirely.

The definition of Dependent Child(ren) now includes those from domestic partnerships.

Key protections include access to plan details, including information about your account's expected return and investment risks, and the right to file grievances or lawsuits for benefits and breaches of fiduciary duty. Additionally, ERISA mandates that plans must provide annually updated summaries of material changes, and it limits your plan's ability to terminate without proper notice.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (rows 1-15 on page 88), policyholders have the right to review various documents governing the plan at no cost, including insurance contracts and collective bargaining agreements, as well as the latest annual report (Form 5500 Series) filed with the U.S. Department of Labor. Upon request in writing, copies can be obtained for a reasonable charge. The administrator is required by law to provide each participant with a summary of the annual financial report.

According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (page 88, rows 1-5), the individuals responsible for your employee benefit plan, known as fiduciaries, are obligated to manage the plan prudently and with your best interests in mind, along with those of other participants and beneficiaries. Any discrimination against you regarding welfare benefits or ERISA rights is prohibited by law, with no exceptions for employers, unions, or any others. This document also emphasizes that fiduciaries must act diligently and loyally to uphold their duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf section outlines rights when a welfare benefit claim is denied or ignored. You have the right to know why this occurs, access documents without charge, and appeal denials within certain timeframes, all under ERISA. If Plan materials aren't provided within 30 days upon request, you can file suit in Federal court. The court may require the administrator to provide the materials and pay up to $110 per day until received, except for reasons beyond their control.

If your benefits claim is denied or ignored, you can file a lawsuit in state or Federal court. However, if administrative appeals are required before filing in court, failure to complete them might impact your right to sue. If Plan fiduciaries misuse funds or discriminate against rights assertion, you may seek help from the U.S. Department of Labor or file suit in Federal court. The court decides court costs and legal fees, with a successful lawsuit potentially making the defendant pay these costs and fees. If unsuccessful, you may be ordered to pay these costs and fees if your claim is found frivolous.

It's crucial to keep up with premium payments to maintain uninterrupted coverage.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, under the Minimum Benefit section (page 5, row 16), pre-existing conditions are subject to a 3/12 rule. This means that if you have a medical condition diagnosed or treated within 12 months before your policy effective date, it will be considered a pre-existing condition.

<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, if overpayments occur on your claim due to fraud, errors in processing, or receipt of deductible income sources, you are required to reimburse the full amount.

The document outlines your coverage, specifies who receives payments from Unum, and lists any applicable limitations, exclusions, and requirements under the policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, eligibility for coverage is determined when you are employed by your group's employer, provided the group is eligible. The eligibility date falls on the later of two instances: either the plan's effective date or the day following the completion of your waiting period.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, your coverage begins as follows: If your employer pays the full cost of the policy, you're covered at 12:01 a.m. on the eligibility date. When you or your employer share the cost or pay individually, you are covered at 12:01 a.m., either on the eligibility date if you apply beforehand, within 31 days after eligibility, or upon Unum's approval of your application (if evidence of insurability is required due to late application or reapplying after voluntary cancellation). Evidence of insurability can be obtained from your employer.
<EOS>
According to the policy in Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, your coverage will commence once you return to active employment following an absence due to injury, sickness, temporary layoff, or leave of absence. The effective date for your coverage is established upon your return to work, and this stipulation applies regardless of the reason for your absence from work.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669 on pages 8, rows 1-3, if you experience a temporary layoff and consistently pay the premium, your coverage will be maintained through the month directly following the one in which your temporary layoff commences. This ensures that you remain protected during this transitional period.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, during a leave of absence, coverage is provided up until the month immediately following the one in which your leave commences, provided premiums are being paid. This means that if your leave begins in October, for instance, you'll remain covered until the end of November. It's important to note that this applies only when premium payments continue during your absence.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, any increases or additional coverage under your policy will take immediate effect if you are actively employed, on a covered layoff, or leave of absence. If absent due to injury or illness, coverage begins upon your return to work. Decreases in coverage apply immediately but do not affect claims made prior to the decrease.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, your coverage under the policy or plan will end on the earliest of the following:

- Cancellation of the policy or plan.
- Your exclusion from an eligible group.
- The cessation of coverage for your eligible group.
- The final day for which you made required contributions.
- The last day you remain in active employment, except as provided under the covered layoff or leave of absence provision. Notably, Unum will cover a payable claim that occurs while you are insured under the policy or plan.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, you have 60 days following proof of claim submission to initiate legal action regarding your claim. The statute of limitations for such actions is 3 years from the required proof of claim date, unless federal law provides otherwise. This timeframe may vary based on specific circumstances or legislation.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, any statements provided in your or your employer's signed application for coverage are considered representations rather than warranties. If these statements are found to be incomplete or untrue at the time of submission, Unum retains the right to either reduce or deny any claim, or cancel the policy effective from its original start date. Statements made in a signed application will be used as grounds for such actions. However, after two years of coverage, these statements cannot be utilized to reduce or deny claims. In cases where the employer provides incorrect information about you, Unum will use it to determine your coverage under the plan, in accordance with the policy provisions and amounts specified.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, page 10, row 1, the policy includes a provision for adjusting premiums fairly. This adjustment may be necessary due to changes in the employee's salary or other factors. The adjustment is expected to be made as per the policy guidelines, and it is crucial that any such adjustments are communicated promptly. The policy does not specify a particular timeframe for making these adjustments, but it emphasizes their importance and fairness. The percentage of adjustment will depend on the specific circumstances of each case. It's essential to note that this provision applies only to Employee-3, effective from 6/27/2012.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on page 10, Unum is committed to preventing insurance fraud that might lead to unnecessary costs for you and your employer. They vow to employ all necessary means for detecting, investigating, and prosecuting fraud cases. It's considered a crime to intentionally provide false, incomplete, or misleading information to Unum with the aim of defrauding or deceiving them. Actions that contain materially false information may lead to claim denial, prosecution, and punishment under state and/or federal law. If insurance fraud occurs, Unum will take appropriate legal action.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 10 (rows 1-2), this policy does not replace or supersede the compulsory coverage under workers' compensation and state disability insurance. In other words, your entitlements from this insurance are contingent upon qualifying for those programs as well.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf (page 10 and 11, rows 1, 2, 2, 3), your employer serves as either its own representative or an agent for you, but never on behalf of Unum. This policy stipulation was established on June 27, 2012 (LTD-BEN-1).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on page 11, disability is defined as a determination by Unum that you are unable to perform the material and substantial duties of your regular occupation due to sickness or injury, coupled with a loss of 20% or more in indexed monthly earnings caused by the same condition. Examinations by physicians, other medical practitioners, or vocational experts may be required at Unum's discretion, and they will cover costs. Interviews by authorized Unum representatives are also possible. A professional or occupational license loss does not automatically equate to disability status.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, if you qualify for benefits under items 1, 2, and 3 in the deductible sources of income section and these benefits have not been awarded, denied, or are being appealed, your Long Term Disability payment may be reduced by an estimated amount. However, this reduction will not occur if you apply for these benefits and appeal any denial to all administrative levels deemed necessary by Unum, while signing their payment option form. An overpayment adjustment is made when proof of awarded amounts or completed appeals is provided; a lump sum refund will be issued in such cases. If a lump sum is received from any deductible sources, it will be prorated monthly over a reasonable time period if no specific duration is stated. This information can be found on pages [15, 16] of the document, rows [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 2, 3].
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on page 11, row 1, if you meet the policy's definition of disability, you can still satisfy your elimination period while working. However, any earnings during this period will be reduced proportionately, with a maximum reduction of 85% of the weekly benefit amount. The elimination period lasts for 30 days from the start date of your disability. It's essential to understand that continuing work may impact the duration of your disability benefits. This information is subject to the terms and conditions outlined in your policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 11, rows 1-3, benefit payments will commence once your claim is approved, assuming the elimination period has been fulfilled and you are deemed disabled. Regular monthly payments will be sent for any qualifying duration. The payment frequency is monthly, and the coverage is valid as long as Unum assumes liability.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, your disability benefit payment will be determined as follows: if you're unable to perform the duties of your own occupation for a consecutive 24 months (or up to your Normal Retirement Age, whichever is earlier), we'll pay you 60% of your pre-disability monthly earnings. If your disability continues beyond that point and prevents you from performing any suitable occupation, we will continue to provide benefits, with the payment amount based on 45% of your pre-disability earnings. Any future increases in benefits due to cost-of-living adjustments are subject to Unum's discretion. This policy is effective upon receipt of the first premium payment.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, the monthly disability payment you receive is determined by comparing two amounts: your gross monthly benefit and the lesser of these two figures becomes your disability payment. This comparison can be found on page 11, row 6. It's essential to remember that this determination adheres to the policy outlined in Unum Cert 4703669.pdf.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Cert 4703669.pdf (page 12, rows 2, 3, 1), the monthly payment figure detailed in Item 4 represents your Long-Term Disability (LTD) benefit amount under LTD-BEN-2 policy issued on June 27, 2012. Notably, any deductible sources of income must be subtracted from this monthly disability payment.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Cert 4703669.pdf (page 12, rows 1-6), your "Monthly Earnings" are defined as the gross income from your employer before disability onset. This figure encompasses all earnings before taxes but excludes contributions to deferred compensation plans, Section 125 plans, or flexible spending accounts. Notably, it does not incorporate income derived from commissions, bonuses, overtime pay, additional compensations, or sources other than your employer.
<EOS>
During a covered layoff or leave of absence as outlined in Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, if you become disabled, your monthly earnings from your employer effective just prior to the commencement of your absence will be used for disability benefits calculation. This means that the income you had before taking the leave or going on layoff will serve as a basis for determining your disability benefits.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669 on page 12 rows [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11], if you become disabled due to the same sickness or injury, and your monthly disability earnings are less than 20% of your indexed monthly earnings, Unum will send you a monthly payment. If your monthly disability earnings range between 20% and 80% of your indexed monthly earnings, Unum will calculate your payment such that for the first 12 months while working, there will be no reduction as long as the combined disability earnings plus gross disability payment do not surpass 100% of your indexed monthly earnings.
<EOS>
In Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, if the response from Item 1 does not exceed or equal 100% of your indexed monthly earnings (page 12, rows 16-17, 19-20, 22-23), no further reduction in your monthly payment will occur. However, if it surpasses 100%, Unum will deduct the excess percentage from your payment. After 12 months of payments while working, you'll receive a payment proportionate to the disability-related income loss percentage (page 12).
<EOS>
In accordance with the Unum Cert 4703669 policy on page 12, row 27, your benefit is calculated as a percentage of your lost earnings. To determine this, your monthly benefits will be divided by your indexed monthly earnings. This calculation may affect the amount you receive and could impact the coverage duration. Please note that specific details regarding the exact percentage may vary based on your individual circumstances.
<EOS>
This Unum policy (Cert 4703669) states that the monthly payment amount will be multiplied by the figure in Item 2. If required, provide quarterly proof of disability earnings. The payments will be adjusted accordingly based on these earnings. During the elimination period, Unum may request appropriate financial records to substantiate your income. After this period, if you are disabled for less than a month, you will receive 1/30 of your payment for each day of disability. After the first month of disability, payments continue indefinitely at the calculated amount.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, if your disability earnings fluctuate significantly from month to month, they may average your earnings over the previous 3 months to decide whether to continue your claim. Your claim will not be terminated unless the average of the last three months' disability earnings surpasses 80% of indexed monthly earnings. However, no payments will be made for any month where disability earnings exceed this percentage limit.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf (page 13, rows 1-2), any disability payment received under this policy may be reduced by certain deductible sources of income. These include:

1. Short-term or long-term disability benefits from your employer or another insurance company, if these payments are payable due to the same disability for which you are receiving Unum's benefit.
2. Workers' compensation benefits or settlements related to work injuries or illnesses.
3. State disability benefits, such as Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and state temporary disability benefits.
4. Retirement plan payments or pensions that begin before age 65 due to your own retirement or disability.
5. Unemployment compensation, including extended unemployment benefits.
6. Military retirement pay, if you retired on disability.
7. Any other income received as a result of your sickness or injury.

The reduction will be made according to the lesser of the amount you receive from these sources or 80% of your Unum disability payment. This percentage may vary depending on the type of policy you hold with Unum.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf (pages 13, rows 6-8), your benefits are affected by various laws such as workers' compensation and occupational disease laws, as well as any other acts or legislation with similar intent. These laws determine the amount you receive or are entitled to receive. The percentage of your salary that can be paid out varies based on these specific laws, but it is subject to a maximum benefit limit stated in the policy. Additionally, any payments from these laws will reduce the benefits you receive under this policy. The duration of your benefits may also be influenced by these laws, with some potentially extending or shortening your payment period. It's essential to understand that any changes in these related laws can impact your benefits.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 13 (rows 11, 13, 14, 15), the disability income amount you receive or are eligible to receive excludes benefits derived from:

* State compulsory benefit acts or laws.
* Other group insurance plans unrelated to your employment with the Employer.
* Governmental retirement systems associated with your job with the Employer.

It's essential to note that any payments from these sources will not affect your disability income benefits under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 13 and relevant row numbers 18, 20, 21, 22, and 23, the benefits you, your spouse, or children may receive are contingent upon disability payments derived from multiple sources. These include but are not limited to:

- The United States Social Security Act
- The Canada Pension Plan
- The Quebec Pension Plan
- Any similar plan or act of comparable nature

The receipt of these benefits may impact the amount you receive under this policy, as they are considered supplementary income sources. It is essential to note that any modifications to these plans could potentially affect your benefit entitlement under this policy. Please consult the relevant authorities or legal advisors for updated information on these plans.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 13 and 14, if you receive retirement payments under the United States Social Security Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the Quebec Pension Plan, or any similar plan or act, your dependents' benefits may be affected due to these retirements. This policy was updated on LTD-BEN-4 (6/27/2012). The exact impact of these retirement payments on your dependents' benefits depends on the specific plan or act involved.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, disability payments under your employer's retirement plan are defined benefits paid due to disability and do not affect the retirement benefit if no disability occurred. These payments are based on your employer's contribution to the retirement plan, with disability benefits reducing the retirement benefit also considered as a retirement benefit.

The retirement funds from the retirement plan will be distributed simultaneously throughout your lifetime, considering both yours and your employer's contributions. The definition of an eligible retirement plan follows Section 402 of the Internal Revenue Code, including any future amendments. Amounts received do not include rolled-over or transferred amounts to any eligible retirement plan.

Lastly, you have the option to voluntarily elect to receive these payments when reaching the later of age 62 or the normal retirement age as defined in your employer's retirement plan.
<EOS>
Under Unum's policy as outlined in Cert 4703669.pdf, only post-disability income sources, excluding retirement payments, will be deducted from your payout, subject to the Jones Act. Subtractions will not be made for your Social Security retirement income if your disability onset occurs after age 65 and you were already receiving these benefits priorly. This policy is applicable to rows [29, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36] of the specified document page [14].
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 14 and 15, various income sources are not deductible from your gross disability payment. These include 401(k) plans, profit sharing plans, thrift plans, tax-sheltered annuities, stock ownership plans, non-qualified deferred compensation plans, pension plans for partners, military pensions and disability income, credit disability insurance, franchise disability income plans, retirement plans from another Employer, Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA), individual disability income plans, no fault motor vehicle plans, salary continuation or accumulated sick leave plans. Additionally, it mentions other unspecified sources not listed here. (6/27/2012)
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on page 15, the minimum monthly benefit payment is either $100 or 10% of your gross disability payment. If there's an outstanding overpayment, Unum may apply this amount to settle it. Keep in mind that this figure could be subject to adjustment as your situation evolves.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 15, rows 1-3, if a deductible income source is subtracted from your gross disability payment, Unum will not reduce your payment further due to any cost of living increase stemming from that particular income source. This means that the cost of living adjustments from these specific sources do not affect the disability benefits you receive. The deduction of the income source serves as a one-time reduction in your payments, preventing double reductions from both the original payment and potential cost of living increases.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, the length of payments for disability benefits is determined by your age at the time of disability. For individuals under 62 years old, payments continue up to age 67. If you're aged 62, you'll receive benefits for 60 months; if 63, 48 months; 64, 42 months; 65, 36 months; 66, 30 months; 67, 24 months; 68, 18 months; and over 69, 12 months. After these periods, payments cease. The maximum period of payment decreases as you age.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, your payments will cease and the claim will conclude on one of the following events:

1. If you're capable of working part-time in your usual occupation despite remaining disabled but opt not to do so.
2. At the end of the maximum payment period.
3. Upon determination that you no longer meet the plan's disability criteria.
4. If proof of continuing disability is not provided.
5. When your earnings from work exceed the allowable amount under the plan.
6. Upon your death.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, disabilities stemming from self-reported symptoms or mental illnesses have a maximum payout period of up to 24 months. However, payments may continue past the 24-month mark if either one or both conditions are met: either the disability significantly limits your ability to perform essential job functions with or without reasonable accommodations, or you undergo an organ transplant. It is essential to note that disabilities based on self-reported symptoms and mental illnesses are subject to this 24-month limitation.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, if you are confined in a hospital or institution at the end of the 24-month period, payments will continue. If you remain disabled upon discharge, additional payments are sent for up to 90 days recovery period. If you get reconfined during this recovery period and stay confined for at least 14 consecutive days, payments resume for that prolonged confinement and an extra recovery period of 90 days.
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 4703669.pdf policy section on pages 16 and 17 indicates that if you continue to be disabled after receiving payments for 24 months, and are hospitalized or institutionalized for at least 14 consecutive days, Unum will provide additional payments throughout your reconfinement period. However, payments will not extend beyond the limited pay period or maximum payment period, whichever comes first. The mental illness limitation will not apply to dementia if it results from stroke, trauma, viral infection, Alzheimer's disease, or other conditions not typically treated by a mental health provider using psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or similar methods. This policy was updated on 6/27/2012 (LTD-BEN-7).
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 4703669 policy does not cover disabilities stemming from self-inflicted injuries, active participation in a riot, loss of a professional or occupational license or certification, criminal convictions under state or federal law, or pre-existing conditions. Disabilities resulting from war, declared or undeclared, are also excluded. Benefits will not be paid during incarceration periods.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, a pre-existing condition is defined as any medical issue for which you sought treatment, consultation, care, services, or prescribed medication within the three months preceding your coverage's effective date, or for which an ordinarily prudent person would have consulted a healthcare provider during the same period. The disability must also start within the first 12 months after your coverage begins to be considered a pre-existing condition.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, if a disability recurs within 6 months of ending a prior claim and the policyholder has been continuously insured, their recurrent disability will not require another elimination period and will be subject to the same plan terms as the prior claim (page [17]). Any disability that occurs after 6 months from the end of the prior claim will be considered a new claim, subject to all policy provisions (page [18]). Note that if the policyholder becomes entitled to payments under any other group long term disability plan, they will not receive payments under the Unum plan.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, upon receiving proof of death, a lump sum benefit equivalent to three months of your gross disability payment will be provided to your eligible survivor, if your disability had continued for at least 180 consecutive days and you were receiving or entitled to receive payments under the plan at the time of your death. If there are no eligible survivors, payment will be made to your estate (except in cases where no estate exists). The policy also states that any overpayment on your claim will first be deducted from the survivor benefit before it is disbursed.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 19 rows [1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10], when a policy becomes effective, coverage is provided by Unum for individuals not employed actively due to sickness or injury, who were previously insured under another policy (continuity of coverage). The coverage is contingent upon premium payment, limited to the amount that would have been paid by the prior carrier. Unum will adjust your payment to account for any liability of the previous carrier.
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 4703669.pdf section on pages [19, 20, 21], rows [14, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 2, 3], outlines conditions for receiving payments if disability results from a pre-existing condition after your employer changes insurance carriers to Unum. To be eligible, you must have been in active employment and insured under the plan on its effective date and also insured by the prior policy at the time of change.

If you meet these conditions, Unum will determine payments according to their plan provisions, but your payment will be the lesser of: a) the monthly benefit that would have been payable under the terms of the prior plan if it had remained in force; or b) the monthly payment under the Unum plan.

Your benefits will end on the earlier of two dates: 1) the end of the maximum benefit period under the plan, or 2) the date benefits would have ended under the prior plan if it had remained in force.

If you do not meet these conditions, Unum will not make any payments (LTD-OTR-2, 6/27/2012). If you only satisfy Item 2, your claim will be administered according to the Unum plan provisions (LTD-OTR-3, 6/27/2012).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 21, rows 1-3, to be eligible for the additional disability coverage (referred to as Disability Plus), you must already be insured under the Unum Long Term Disability (LTD) plan. The coverage is subject to all policy definitions and specific provisions detailed in this Rider. Essentially, if you meet the criteria of your existing LTD plan, you may also qualify for this supplementary disability benefit, with all its terms and conditions applying concurrently.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, Disability Plus coverage will commence on the later of either the effective date of this rider or your effective date under the LTD plan. The duration of Disability Plus coverage is contingent upon the rider remaining active and your continuous insurance coverage under the LTD plan. This policy does not specify an end date for Disability Plus coverage.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 21, rows [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12], Disability Plus benefits will be paid if you provide proof of disability under this rider and receive monthly payments from the LTD plan. The disability criteria involve loss of ability to safely perform two activities of daily living without assistance or verbal cues, or a deterioration in intellectual capacity requiring assistance or verbal cues for protection. These benefits start after the elimination period shown in the LTD plan, and they continue so long as you remain disabled under these terms.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, the Disability Plus benefit is calculated as 20% of your monthly earnings, with a maximum monthly payment of either the LTD plan's maximum monthly benefit or $5,000. Notably, this benefit amount is not influenced by policy provisions that would otherwise adjust it, such as Deductible Sources of Income. These terms apply only to the specified section on page 21, rows 1, 2, 4, and 5.
<EOS>
According to the Disability Plus Rider in Unum Cert 4703669.pdf (page numbers 21, 22 rows [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 2, 3]), coverage exclusions and limitations apply. The rider does not provide benefits for a loss resulting from:

1. Inability to safely and completely perform daily activities without assistance or verbal cues on the effective date of coverage.
2. Deterioration or loss in intellectual capacity requiring assistance or verbal cues for protection, either yours or others'.

These exclusions were updated on June 27, 2012 (LTD-OTR-4).

<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, disability benefits under the Disability Plus rider will cease on the earliest of the following dates: your recovery from disability as determined by the Rider, loss of eligibility for monthly payments under the LTD plan, the end of the maximum payment period outlined in the LTD plan, or upon your death. Notably, no survivor benefits are offered for this Disability Plus coverage.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4703669 document on pages 22, rows 1 and 2, the Disability Plus coverage premium is waived while you are receiving monthly payments under the Long-Term Disability (LTD) plan. This means that during this period, you will not be required to pay for the Disability Plus coverage. This waiver of premium is a feature designed to help support you financially when you need it most.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, on row 3 of page 23, there is a provision (STATE REQ-1 dated 6/27/2012) stating that if an insured's disability continues after 24 months and they reach the age of 65, the policy will continue with 50% benefit payable up to the age of 67, following which it will terminate. This implies that upon reaching the age of 67, the insured will receive no further benefits under this policy. The reduction in benefits from the initial amount to 50% begins at the 25th month of disability and continues until the end of the policy.

According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf (pages 26, rows 38-39), Disability Earnings refer to the income you receive while disabled, encompassing your current earnings and potential earnings if you were able to work at maximum capacity during that period. This policy does not cover any difference between your pre-disability and post-disability earnings, regardless of whether you are working or not. The policy also states that benefits will be reduced by any other income received, such as workers' compensation, social security disability benefits, or other insurance payments for the same condition. This reduction is done on a dollar-for-dollar basis and will apply to the total disability benefits payable under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, a continuous disability period, referred to as the Elimination Period, must be satisfied before benefits can be received. This waiting phase varies and is determined based on the individual's elected option. For example, if an individual chooses a 30-day elimination period, they will not receive benefits for the first 30 days of disability. The total disability length is calculated from the date of disabling event until Unum determines the claim eligible for benefits. This phase ensures that individuals are still able to recover and return to work before benefits kick in.

According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, page 27 row 2, the Grace Period refers to a time frame after the due date of a premium payment where it can still be made. The specific details vary based on the policy, but typically, this period lasts for a certain number of days, during which late fees may accrue. After the end of the grace period, if the premium has not been paid, the policy may lapse or terminate. This provision aims to give policyholders some leeway should they inadvertently miss a payment deadline.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, under Gross Disability Payment, the benefit amount is calculated before any deductions are made for sources of income and disability earnings. This means that the total amount you receive may be reduced if you have other income during your disability period. The reduction percentage will depend on your specific case. It's important to note that this reduction applies only to the Gross Disability Payment, not any additional benefits or supplementary payments provided by Unum. The exact calculation and applicable reductions will be determined at the time of claim evaluation.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on page 27, row 8, "HOSPITAL OR INSTITUTION" refers to an accredited facility licensed to provide care for the condition causing your disability. This provision covers necessary treatment in such a facility, provided it remains accredited and licensed during the duration of your disability. The definition excludes institutions primarily engaged in providing custodial care, rehabilitation, or educational services unrelated to medical care. The policy also specifies that care received outside these accredited facilities may still be covered if deemed medically necessary by a Unum representative.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 27 rows [11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20], Indexed Monthly Earnings refer to your earnings adjusted annually by the lesser of 10% or the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI-W), published by the U.S. Department of Labor. This adjustment may cause an increase or no change but will never decrease. Unum reserves the right to use another comparable measurement if CPI-W is altered or discontinued. The indexing process calculates your percentage of lost earnings while disabled and working.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, an injury is defined as a bodily harm that directly results from an accident and is unrelated to any other cause. For disability benefits to apply, the disability must commence while the policyholder is under coverage.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, a person is considered Insured under a plan when specific legal, plan, or act-related matters are in question (rows 27, 28 on page 27). These original laws, plans, or acts encompass all amendments made over time (LAW, PLAN, or ACT means these foundational and subsequent alterations). This comprehensive coverage ensures that the interpretation of the policy is consistent with the evolving regulations and plan provisions.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, a temporary layoff or leave of absence is defined as an agreed-upon absence from active employment with your employer for a specified duration, in writing. This does not encompass regular vacation time or any period of disability. Notably, the policy differentiates this from normal working periods.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, under the Material and Substantial Duties clause (rows 41, 42 on page 27), your regular occupation duties that are customarily expected and essential for performance, cannot be reasonably omitted or modified are considered material and substantial. This means that any alteration to these critical duties will impact the determination of total disability benefits.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, maximum capacity refers to the scope of work you can perform in your regular occupation that is reasonably accessible. This definition is based on any restrictions or limitations imposed due to your health condition. The policy limits benefits to this capacity level, provided it does not exceed 100%.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669, page 27 row 49, the Maximum Period of Payment refers to the longest duration for which benefits will be paid during any one period of disability. The specific period depends on the policy details but is generally limited. For instance, if the policy specifies a maximum benefit period of 5 years, Unum would not pay beyond that timeframe should the disability persist beyond this limit. It's essential to understand and adhere to these limits when making claims under your insurance policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, mental illness is defined as any psychiatric or psychological condition, including but not limited to schizophrenia, depression, manic depressive/bipolar illness, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, adjustment disorders, and other conditions. These ailments can stem from various causes. The policy is applicable without specifying a particular diagnosis date.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4703669.pdf (page 28, rows 3, 1, 2), mental health treatment typically involves psychotherapy, medication, or other methods provided by a qualified professional for up to 27 sessions. The frequency of these sessions may vary, with weekly sessions being the norm. The policy includes coverage for outpatient services as well as in-home healthcare when necessary. Additionally, the policy specifies that there is a 30-day time frame within which to seek treatment following an injury or onset of symptoms.

According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on page 28, row 5, the 'Monthly Benefit' refers to the total amount an employee is insured for under this plan, subject to the maximum benefit. This benefit amount is crucial as it determines the financial assistance provided in case of disability. For instance, if an employee has a monthly benefit of $3,000 and the maximum benefit is $5,000, they would receive up to $3,000 each month. This financial aid aims to help the employee maintain their standard of living during periods of disability-related inability to work.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, on page 28 row 8, "MONTHLY EARNINGS" refers to your gross monthly income from your employer, as defined in the plan. This amount serves as a crucial factor in determining the benefits you're eligible for under this policy. For instance, if your monthly earnings change due to a promotion or job shift, it may impact the amount of disability benefits you receive. It is essential to keep your employer updated about such changes to ensure accurate benefit calculations.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Cert 4703669.pdf (page 28, rows 11, 13, 14), the term 'Monthly Payment' refers to your disability payment after any deductible sources of income have been subtracted. Moreover, you are considered on a Part-Time Basis if you can work and earn between 20% and 80% of your indexed monthly earnings. These terms are crucial in understanding the policy details.

According to the Unum Cert 4703669 document on page 28, a Physician is defined as an individual licensed to practice medicine, prescribe and administer drugs, or perform surgery; a person with a doctoral degree in Psychology (Ph.D. or Psy.D.) who primarily treats patients; or a legally qualified medical practitioner according to the laws and regulations of the governing jurisdiction. Unum does not recognize claimants, their spouses, children, parents, or siblings as physicians for claim purposes.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, a 'PRE-EXISTING CONDITION' is defined as one for which medical treatment, consultation, care or services (including diagnostic measures) were received, prescribed drugs or medicines taken, or symptoms for which an ordinarily prudent person would have consulted a health care provider, during the specified period of time outlined in the plan. This refers to any condition with prior medical history or symptoms that warranted consultation during this period.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 28, rows 42-44, Recurrent Disability refers to a condition worsening from a prior one for which Unum made Long Term Disability payments. The disability is considered recurrent if it is due to the same causes as the initial disability, implying that the original cause of the disability has returned or persisted in such a way that it results in a new period of disability. This definition applies only when the disability is not a continuation of the prior one but rather a distinct event with similar causative factors.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, Regular Care necessitates that you visit a physician as frequently as medically required according to accepted medical standards, for effectively managing and treating your disabling condition(s). The care must align with generally accepted medical standards, provided by a physician whose specialty or experience is most appropriate for your specific conditions. This care should be the most appropriate for your disabling condition(s) as defined by accepted medical standards.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, under the Glossary-4 section dated June 27, 2012 (page 29, row 3), the term 'Modified Expected Period of Disability' (MEPD) refers to the period of disability estimated at the time of claim for which an employee is eligible to receive benefits under a Short-Term or Long-Term Disability plan. The MEPD may be reviewed and adjusted based on changes in the employee's condition or circumstances. The initial MEPD determination is typically made using a combination of medical information, functional capacity assessments, job analysis, and other relevant data. Benefits are payable for the duration of the MEPD, unless the disability ends earlier due to recovery, death, or return to work.
<EOS>
In the Unum Cert 4703669.pdf document, it is clarified that 'Regular Occupation' refers to the job you were regularly performing before disability, as defined differently for physicians and other employees. For physicians, this includes their general or sub-specialty at the time of disability, certified by the American Board of Medical Specialties. If a sub-specialty is not recognized, they are categorized under general specialty. All other employees' regular occupation encompasses the material and substantial duties recognized in the general workplace prior to the onset of disability. Unum considers this occupation according to national economy standards, rather than specific employer or location requirements.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 29, rows 20-22, a Retirement Plan refers to defined contribution or defined benefit plans that offer retirement benefits and are not exclusively employee-funded. The scope of this term encompasses any plan integrated within federal, state, county, municipal, or association retirement systems. Essentially, these are retirement plans that receive contributions from sources other than employees alone.
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 4703669 policy section on Salary Continuation or Accumulated Sick Leave (page 29, rows 25-37) outlines continued payments to you from your employer for a portion of your earnings upon disability, provided it's part of an established plan for all covered employees. Self-reported symptoms such as headaches, pain, fatigue, or numbness may be reported but are not verifiable through standard medical tests. Such compensation excludes disability earnings from work performed post-disability, which would affect the monthly payment calculation.
<EOS>
Under Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, a sickness is defined as an illness or disease. To qualify for disability benefits, the incapacity must commence while coverage is active. This benefit applies only under the specified plan and does not require hospitalization or bed confinement to be considered disabling. Additionally, the definition of sickness may include mental disorders, provided they are diagnosed by a licensed medical professional. Benefit payments are subject to taxation in accordance with applicable laws.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, a beneficiary eligible for benefits upon your death is either your spouse, if alive, or your children under the age of 25, with equal benefit distributions.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 29 (rows 46, 47, 49), eligibility for coverage requires active employment in an eligible group before benefits can be claimed. The waiting period is specified within each plan. Unum Life Insurance Company of America (we, us, our) is the entity responsible for these policies.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, section ADDLSUM-1 (6/27/2012), under long-term disability benefits, if an employee is eligible for a regular retirement benefit from the City of New York Retirement System or another retirement system in the U.S., their monthly disability benefit will be reduced by 50%. This reduction applies if the employee's combined ages and years of creditable service equal or exceed 80 points, calculated using their age and years of creditable service as of the month preceding the one in which their disability begins. For example, if an employee is 60 years old with 20 years of creditable service, they would have 100 points (60 + 20 = 80). However, if they have less than 80 points, no reduction applies. This reduction is effective only for long-term disability benefits and does not affect other aspects of the policy.

According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 30 (rows 28-31), the disability benefit administration is shared between the Plan Administrator and the insurer. The insurer handles benefits provision in accordance with the issued insurance policy for the Plan. This policy outlines that total disability benefits, up to 60% of pre-disability earnings, are paid monthly during the duration of the disability. However, if an individual's disability is caused by a mental or nervous condition, the maximum payable benefit percentage decreases to 45%. The definition of disability for the first 24 months following the start date of disability is based on the claimant being unable to perform their own occupation; thereafter, it transitions to any gainful occupation. The policy also specifies that benefits will cease upon recovery or death, and that a claimant must be under age 65 at the time of disability onset to be eligible for these benefits.
<EOS>

<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, the policy or a plan under the policy can be cancelled either by Unum or the Policyholder. Unum may cancel if there's less than 75% participation of premium-paying eligible employees for a partially funded plan, or 100% for a fully funded one. Similarly, lack of required information, failure to meet obligations, fewer than 10 insured employees, and late premium payment within the 31-day grace period may lead to cancellation. The policy/plan terminates automatically at the end of the grace period if no payment is made. Premiums for coverage during the grace period are the Policyholder's responsibility. Unum requires a written notice 31 days before cancellation, and so does the Policyholder. Both parties can agree to cancel earlier. If Unum cancels, a 31-day prior written notice will be given.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 32, the policyholder can terminate the policy or a specific plan, with coverage ending at midnight of the final day covered. Regardless of cancellation, any existing claim will still be payable. The cancellation itself will not impact a validated claim.

When costs are shared or self-paid, coverage starts at 12:01 a.m., either on the eligibility date if an application is submitted beforehand, within 31 days post-eligibility, or upon approval, should evidence of insurability be necessary. Evidence of insurability is required if you're a late applicant (more than 31 days past eligibility) or reapplying after voluntary cancellation. An evidence of insurability form can be acquired from your employer.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, if you are unable to work due to injury, illness, temporary layoff or leave of absence, your coverage begins on the date you resume active employment. This means that your policy does not provide benefits during these periods of absence, but starts once you return to work actively.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on pages 8, rows 1-3, if you experience a temporary layoff and continue premium payments, your coverage will extend through the month immediately following the one during which your temporary leave commences.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on pages 9, rows 1-3, during a leave of absence, coverage is maintained up until the month that directly follows the one in which your leave begins, as long as premiums are paid.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, increased or additional coverage takes effect immediately if you are in active employment, on a covered layoff, or leave of absence. If absent due to injury or sickness, the new coverage starts on your return to work. Decreased coverage becomes effective immediately without affecting existing claims. Any adjustments made to your coverage do not apply retroactively.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, your insurance coverage ends on the earliest of these events: the policy or plan being cancelled; you leaving an eligible group; the cessation of coverage for your group; the last day of any required contributions period; or the day you cease active employment (except during covered layoff or leave of absence). Unum will cover payable claims that occur while you are still insured under the policy or plan.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, you may initiate legal action regarding your claim between 60 days following the proof of claim submission and up to three years from when the proof of claim is required. Federal law exceptions may apply. This timeframe for legal proceedings pertains to your claim.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, any statements made by you or your employer during the signed application process for coverage are considered representations rather than warranties. If these statements prove incomplete or untrue at the time they're submitted, Unum reserves the right to either reduce or deny any claim, or cancel the policy from its original effective date. Information obtained from a signed application will be used as the basis for such actions, but this cannot be done if the coverage has been active for at least two years. However, if the employer provides incorrect information about you, Unum will assess whether your coverage complies with the plan's provisions and in what amounts. This policy applies to the rows [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16] on page number [9].
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, on page 10 row 1, there is a provision for adjusting the premium fairly. This adjustment may be necessary when the actual experience of claimants differs from the original assumptions made during policy issuance. The adjustment percentage will depend on the specifics of each case and may result in either an increase or decrease in the premium. It's important to note that this provision is subject to the terms and conditions of the policy and any applicable laws. This adjustment process could potentially take place at specified review periods, such as every three years.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, the company takes insurance fraud seriously and vows to employ all reasonable means for detection, investigation, and possible prosecution. It is unlawful to intentionally deceive or mislead Unum by submitting false, incomplete, or misleading information, including while filing a claim. Engaging in such practices will lead to claim denial, with potential legal consequences under state and federal law. The company reserves the right to pursue appropriate legal action if insurance fraud is detected.
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 4703668 policy does not replace or supersede the necessity for coverage by any workers' compensation or state disability insurance. The policy operates independently of such programs. Specifically, it does not affect your entitlement to state disability benefits in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, your employer acts either on its own behalf or as your representative in the context of this policy. Under no circumstances will they be considered Unum's agent. This clarification was made on June 27, 2012.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, disability is defined as: a determination that you're unable to perform the material and substantial duties of your regular occupation due to sickness or injury, coupled with a 20% or more loss in indexed monthly earnings because of the same condition. After 24 months of payments, disability is also defined as being unable to perform any gainful occupation for which you're reasonably fitted by education, training or experience, again due to the same sickness or injury. The loss of a professional or occupational license or certification doesn't automatically classify you as disabled. Unum may require examinations by physicians, medical practitioners, or vocational experts at their discretion and pay for these evaluations. They can request examinations as frequently as necessary. Additionally, an authorized Unum Representative may interview you during this process.
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 4703668.pdf information on pages 15 and 16 indicates that if you qualify for benefits under items 1, 2, and 3 in the deductible sources of income section, your Long Term Disability payment may be estimated and reduced unless you apply for these benefits, appeal any denial to all necessary administrative levels, and sign Unum's payment option form (LTD-BEN-6 from June 27, 2012). An overpayment adjustment will occur when proof of awarded amounts or completed appeals is provided. If an estimated amount reduction applies, your payment will be readjusted upon receipt of such proof, with a potential lump sum refund to you. Any received lump sum from deductible sources will be prorated monthly over the given time period, using a reasonable one if none is stated.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, if you meet the definition of disability, you can satisfy your elimination period while working. The elimination period is waived if your disability starts within 90 days after your insurance effective date or within 24 months following any prior coverage termination. If your disability begins later than 90 days after your effective date or more than 24 months since the previous policy termination, you must be off work for at least 14 consecutive days before benefits commence. The length of the elimination period is determined by the type of work you are performing during the disability. For example, if you're working full-time in your own occupation, the elimination period is 30 days; if you're working part-time in your own occupation, it's 60 days. If you're not engaged in any gainful activity, the elimination period is waived altogether.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, payments will commence upon approval of your claim, subject to the elimination period being fulfilled and if you are deemed disabled. The monthly payments will be issued for any period where Unum assumes liability. This policy is active until further notice, with no specified end date.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on pages 11 and 12, row numbers 1, 2, and 3, the payment amount for disability benefits follows LTD-BEN-2 (effective as of 6/27/2012). The benefit is calculated based on your monthly earnings at the time of policy issue, up to a maximum of 60% of such earnings. For any subsequent changes in employment or occupation, the calculation considers a new base amount determined by your most recent earnings. If your benefits exceed the Social Security Disability Benefits (SSDI) you're entitled to, Unum will adjust the payment accordingly. The reduction is applied progressively, starting from the dollar amount equal to the difference between the two benefits.
<EOS>
Under Unum Cert 4703668, your monthly disability payment is determined by comparing two amounts stated in Item 1 of the policy. The lesser amount serves as your gross disability payment. This comparison occurs on page 12, row 4. It's essential to note that the duration and conditions of these payments will be governed by the terms and provisions of the entire policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf (page 12, row 7), your monthly disability payment amount is the figure determined in Item 4. It's important to note that any deductible sources of income will be subtracted from this payment. This means if you receive other forms of income during your disability, they may affect the amount you receive under this policy. Always ensure accurate reporting of all income sources to avoid potential discrepancies and potential impact on your benefits.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on page 12 (rows 1-6), your "Monthly Earnings" refers to the gross income from your employer before disability, inclusive of all earnings before taxes. Excluded are commission, bonus, overtime pay, and any additional compensation, as well as income sourced elsewhere. However, pre-tax contributions towards a qualified deferred compensation plan, Section 125 plan, or flexible spending account are not included in this calculation. The total income under consideration is prior to such deductions.
<EOS>
During a covered layoff or leave of absence as defined by Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, if you experience disability, your monthly earnings during the period will be based on your pre-absence employer salary. Specifically, we will use your employer's wage at the time your leave or absence begins. This means that we will consider this income when determining your benefit amount. It is essential to note that this provision applies only to situations covered under the terms of this policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on page 12, if you are disabled due to the same sickness or injury and your monthly disability earnings are less than 20% of your indexed monthly earnings, we will send you a monthly payment. If your disability earnings equal or exceed 20%, your payment will be calculated with the following condition: During the first 12 months while working, your payment won't be reduced as long as the combined disability earnings and gross disability payment don't surpass 100% of indexed monthly earnings.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on pages 12 (rows 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23), if the response from Item 1 is equal to or less than 100% of your indexed monthly earnings, your monthly payment will not be further reduced. However, if it exceeds 100%, Unum will deduct the excess percentage from your payment. After 12 months of payments while working, you'll receive payments based on the disability-induced income loss percentage.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf (page 12, row 27), the policy provides a percentage of your lost earnings. Specifically, this percentage is calculated by dividing the benefit amount by your indexed monthly earnings. It's essential to note that the percentage varies depending on your occupation and age at the time of disability. The benefit period may extend up to your retirement age or for five years, whichever is longer. Additionally, there are specified maximum and minimum percentages set within the policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on page [13], the monthly payment amount you receive from Unum during disability will be multiplied by the value in Item 2. For the first 24 months of payments, if your disability earnings exceed 80% of your indexed monthly earnings, Unum may cease payments and terminate your claim. After 24 months, if your disability earnings surpass the gross disability payment, your payments will also stop and your claim will end. Proof of your monthly disability earnings must be provided at least quarterly, with adjustments made to your payment based on these reports. Financial records may be required for this purpose. If disabled for less than a month, you will receive 1/30 of the payment for each day of disability.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on page 13, if your disability earnings fluctuate significantly month-to-month, they may average the last three months' earnings to decide whether to continue your claim. Your claim will not be terminated unless, within the first 24 months of payments, the 3-month average surpasses 80% of indexed monthly earnings, or after 24 months, if it exceeds the gross disability payment. Payments are not made for any month where disability earnings exceed the plan's allowable amount.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, certain income sources may be deducted from your gross disability payment. These deductible incomes include: (1) any disability or long-term disability benefits you receive from another source, (2) Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) payments, and (3) Workers' Compensation, public disability benefits, or other governmental disability programs, if those benefits are payable due to the same impairment for which you are receiving Unum benefits. It is essential to note that the total amount deducted from your gross disability payment will not exceed 85% of your earnings prior to the disability. Additionally, Unum may require proof of these deductible income sources and their amounts.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf at pages 13, rows 6, 7, and 8, the benefits you're eligible for include those stipulated by workers' compensation laws, occupational disease laws, or any other legislation with similar intent. These benefits are subject to a maximum percentage of your pre-disability earnings, specifically 2/3rds for total disability and 66 2/3rds for partial disability. The policy duration is until you reach retirement age or the end of the benefit period, whichever comes first. Importantly, any changes in your work status or earnings during this time may affect your benefits. Additionally, the policy requires regular updates on any changes to workers' compensation or occupational disease laws that might impact your entitlements.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on pages 13 and 14, your disability income payments will not include benefits from any state compulsory benefit act or law, other group insurance plans, or governmental retirement systems associated with your employer. This excludes LTD-BEN-4 (effective from 6/27/2012). Your disability income is also unaffected by any governmental retirement system benefits resulting from your employment.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, disability payments you, your spouse, and children might receive or be entitled to stem from various sources. These include the United States Social Security Act, the Canada Pension Plan, and the Quebec Pension Plan. Any similar plans or acts are also applicable. Notably, these payments may be affected if benefits are received under any of these mentioned plans or acts. For instance, if you receive disability payments due to a disability under the United States Social Security Act, your monthly benefit amount will be reduced by 50% for each month that disability payments begin before age 60, with a maximum reduction of 65%. Similarly, if disability benefits are received from the Canada Pension Plan or Quebec Pension Plan prior to age 65, a 2/3 reduction in your Unum disability payment applies. This reduction continues until you reach age 65 or the cessation of CPP or QPP benefits, whichever is sooner.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on page 14, if you receive retirement payments from the United States Social Security Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the Quebec Pension Plan, or any comparable plan or act, your retirement benefits may be reduced due to these sources of income. The reduction percentage varies based on the specific plan and the time at which you begin receiving both types of payments. This reduction does not apply if you are under 65 when your disability benefit starts. In addition, if your children or dependents receive retirement payments, this will not affect their eligibility for benefits under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, disability payments under your employer's retirement plan are defined as benefits paid due to disability that do not affect the retirement benefit if no disability had occurred. These payments will be based on your employer's contributions to the retirement plan and will be considered alongside your own contributions throughout your lifetime. Retirement payments consist of benefits derived from the retirement plan, including those reducing the disability benefit under the plan.

The retirement funds will not include amounts rolled over or transferred to any eligible retirement plan as defined by Section 402 of the Internal Revenue Code. Unum will consider these funds distributed simultaneously throughout your lifetime, regardless of how they are distributed. Retirement benefits will be received when reaching either age 62 or the normal retirement age as defined in your employer's retirement plan.

This information emphasizes that Unum will use the definition of an eligible retirement plan from Section 402 of the Internal Revenue Code, including any future amendments affecting the definition.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on pages 14 and 15, under the Jones Act, Unum will only deduct earnings from sources that are directly related to your disability, excluding retirement payments. If your disability onset occurs after age 65 and you were already receiving Social Security retirement income, your LTD payment will not be affected. This policy was updated on 6/27/2012 (LTD-BEN-5).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, the following income sources will not be subtracted from your gross disability payment: 401(k) plans, profit sharing plans, thrift plans, tax-sheltered annuities, stock ownership plans, non-qualified deferred compensation plans, pension plans for partners, military pensions and disability income plans, credit disability insurance, franchise disability income plans, retirement plans from another employer, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), individual disability income plans, no-fault motor vehicle plans, salary continuation or accumulated sick leave plans.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, the minimum monthly payment under the minimum benefit provision is either $100 or 10% of your gross disability payment. This amount can be applied toward any outstanding overpayment. In other words, if your gross disability payment is less than $1000, you will pay the greater of $100 or 10% of that payment.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on pages 15, rows 1-3, any deductible income sources will be subtracted from your total disability payment. However, Unum will not subsequently adjust the payment due to a cost of living increase originating from that specific source. This means that while your payment might be reduced by this initial deduction, it will not continue to be affected by future cost of living adjustments stemming from the same income source.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, disability payment duration depends on the age at disability. For individuals younger than 62, payments continue until age 67; with 60 months maximum. Those aged 62 receive payments for 60 months, while those aged 63 get 48 months. The duration reduces to 42 months for ages 64 and 36 months for ages 65, followed by 30 months at age 66 and 24 months at age 67. For individuals aged 68 or older, payments continue for 18 months, while those over 69 receive 12 months.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, payments under this policy will cease on the earliest occasion of:

1. During the initial 24 months, if you can work part-time in your regular occupation but choose not to.
2. After 24 months, if you can engage in any part-time gainful occupation and opt not to.
3. The expiration of the maximum payment period.
4. The point at which you no longer meet the plan's disability definition.
5. Your failure to provide proof of continued disability.
6. When your disability earnings surpass the plan's allowable limit.
7. Upon your death.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, disabilities resulting from sickness or injury primarily based on self-reported symptoms, as well as those due to mental illness, have a limited pay period of up to 24 months under the policy. However, payments will continue beyond this period if you meet either of the following conditions: (1) You are unable to perform any gainful occupation, or (2) You are unable to perform the material and substantial duties of your Own Occupation as defined in the policy, for the first 24 months. This extension of benefits is subject to LTD-BEN-7 (6/27/2012).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on pages 17, rows 6-14, if you are confined in a hospital or institution at the end of the 24-month period, payments will continue during your confinement. If still disabled upon discharge, additional payments will be made for up to 90 days as a recovery period. During this time, any subsequent reconfinement for at least 14 consecutive days triggers further payments during that confinement and an additional 90-day recovery period. This policy applies only once during the recovery period.
<EOS>
This information from Unum Cert 4703668.pdf specifies that if you continue to be disabled past the initial 24-month payment period and are subsequently hospitalized for at least 14 consecutive days, payments will continue during your reconfinement. However, payments will not exceed the specified limited pay period or the maximum duration of payment, whichever comes first. Notably, Unum does not apply the mental illness limitation to dementia resulting from stroke, trauma, viral infection, Alzheimer's disease, or other conditions not typically treated by a mental health provider using psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or similar methods.
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 4703668 policy does not cover disabilities resulting from intentionally self-inflicted injuries, active participation in a riot, loss of a professional or occupational license/certification, commission of a crime for which conviction is under state or federal law, or pre-existing conditions. The policy also does not provide coverage due to war (declared or undeclared), any act of war, or during periods of incarceration. This information is presented on pages [17, 18] with relevant row numbers [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 2, 3]. (LTD-BEN-8, 6/27/2012)
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, a pre-existing condition is identified if, within the three months prior to your policy's effective date: you sought medical treatment, consulted healthcare providers, underwent diagnostic measures, took prescribed drugs or medicines; or you experienced symptoms severe enough that an ordinarily prudent person would have consulted a health professional. If a disability occurs during the first 12 months after your coverage starts, it may be considered as a result of this pre-existing condition.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, if your disability recurs within six months following the end of a prior claim and you have continuous coverage under the plan during this period, your recurrent disability will be considered an extension of the previous claim, bypassing the elimination period requirement. The terms for your recurrent disability will match those of your prior claim. Conversely, any disability that occurs more than six months after the end of your prior claim will be treated as a new claim, subject to all policy provisions. It is important to note that if you become entitled to payments under another group long term disability plan, you will not receive benefits from this Unum plan. This information can be found on pages 18 and 19, rows 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 2, 3 of the document.
<EOS>
This Unum policy (Cert 4703668) provides a lump-sum survivor benefit to an eligible survivor if the policyholder dies, having met the 180 consecutive day disability requirement. The benefit is equal to three months of the policyholder's gross disability payment, payable only when receiving or entitled to receive plan payments at the time of death. If no eligible survivors exist, the payment goes to the estate; otherwise, any overpayment on the claim will be first addressed. No benefits are distributed if there is no estate. The policy does not make a payment in case of no surviving relatives or estate.
<EOS>
Under Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, if your policy becomes effective and you are not employed due to illness or injury while previously covered by another policy (page 19, rows 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10), Unum will provide coverage. Coverage is contingent on premium payment, with the amount limited to what the previous carrier would have paid. Unum may reduce your payment by any liability of the prior carrier. Essentially, continuity of coverage is ensured subject to these conditions.
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 4703668.pdf section clarifies the conditions under which payments are made for disabilities arising from pre-existing conditions when your employer switches insurance carriers to Unum. If you were: (1) in active employment and insured on its effective date, and (2) insured by the previous policy at the time of change, you may receive a payment. This requires satisfying either the Unum plan's pre-existing condition provision or that of the prior carrier's, with benefits paid according to the respective plans.

The lesser of the two monthly benefits will be paid: (a) as per the terms of the prior policy had it remained in force or (b) as provided under the Unum plan. Your benefits terminate on the earlier date: (1) at the end of the plan's maximum benefit period, or (2) the date they would have ended under the prior policy if it hadn't changed. This information pertains to pages 19-21 and rows 14, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 2, 3 of the document.
<EOS>
To be eligible for the additional disability coverage described in the Unum Rider, you must be currently insured under their Long Term Disability (LTD) plan. The policy definitions and provisions specified within this Rider also apply to the additional coverage. Essentially, if your disability meets the criteria outlined in both the LTD plan and this Rider, you may qualify for the added benefits. This additional coverage provides a monthly payment of 60% of your pre-disability earnings (up to the maximum benefit amount specified in the LTD policy), which is subject to taxation based on your individual circumstances. Please note that all terms used within the LTD plan and this Rider hold equal significance for the additional disability coverage.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, Disability Plus coverage becomes effective on the later of either the effective date of this rider or your effective date under the LTD plan. Once effective, the coverage continues as long as the rider remains in effect and you are insured under the LTD plan.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on page 21 (rows 1-12), you become eligible for Disability Plus benefits when both conditions are met: firstly, proof of disability under this rider and current monthly payments under the Long Term Disability (LTD) plan; secondly, the elimination period shown in the LTD plan must expire. You are considered disabled under this rider when Unum determines that due to sickness or injury, you can no longer safely and completely perform at least two daily activities without assistance or verbal cues, or if there's a deterioration or loss of intellectual capacity requiring such assistance or cues for your protection or others'.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, under the Disability Plus benefit, a disabled individual receives 20% of their monthly earnings, but this amount is capped at the lesser of the Long-Term Disability (LTD) plan maximum or $5,000 per month. The benefit is not influenced by policy provisions that could increase or decrease the benefit amount, such as Deductible Sources of Income.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4703668.pdf (page numbers 21, 22), certain exclusions and limitations apply to the Disability Plus Rider. Specifically, this benefit will not be provided for losses resulting from conditions that necessitate assistance or verbal cues for daily activities on the effective date of coverage under this rider. These conditions include a loss of the ability to perform daily living activities without another person's help or cueing, as well as deterioration or loss in intellectual capacity requiring similar assistance. This policy provision was updated on June 27, 2012 (LTD-OTR-4).
<EOS>
Under Unum Cert 4703668.PDF, for Disability Plus Long-Term Disability (LTD) claims, the policy requires specific information. This may include an examination by a physician or medical practitioner chosen by us, as well as an interview with you. These evaluations will be conducted at our expense.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, Disability Plus benefit payments will cease on the earliest of these dates: when you no longer meet the definition of disability under the Rider; upon your ineligibility for monthly payments within the LTD plan; upon reaching the maximum payment period as specified in the LTD plan; or at your death. Importantly, there are no survivor benefits for the Disability Plus coverage.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on pages 22, rows 1 and 2, the Disability Plus coverage premium is waived during periods when you receive monthly payments under the LTD (Long-Term Disability) plan. This means you're exempt from making payments for this additional coverage while you receive income from the primary LTD benefit. However, it's essential to note that other conditions or exclusions may apply, and you should refer to your policy details for a comprehensive understanding.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, under SATE REQ-1 (6/27/2012), in the event of a disability claim due to mental or nervous conditions, if an individual has been treated for more than 24 months by a psychiatrist and psychologist, Unum will require that they be evaluated by another psychiatrist or psychologist chosen by Unum. This evaluation is to be completed within 30 days from the request. If the claimant does not consent to this evaluation, payment of disability benefits may cease. The chosen evaluator will review the case files, perform a physical examination, and submit a written report. Any dispute about the evaluation results can be resolved through Unum's internal appeal process or by independent binding medical review.

Misuse of funds by Plan fiduciaries or discrimination for asserting rights can be reported to the U.S. Department of Labor or addressed through federal court action. The court determines costs and fees. A successful suit could make the defendant pay these costs and fees, while a frivolous claim might lead to your paying them. For questions about the Plan, contact the Plan Administrator. For queries regarding this statement, ERISA rights, or document requests from the Plan Administrator, reach out to the Employee Benefits Security Administration's nearest office or their Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries in Washington, D.C., or call their publications hotline for relevant materials about your ERISA rights and responsibilities.

This information from Unum Cert 4703668.pdf (pages 35 and 36) delineates the Plan Administrator's delegation of discretionary authority to Unum and its affiliate, Unum Group, for making benefit determinations under the plan. They can act directly or through employees, agents, or further delegated entities. The discretion encompasses eligibility, amount determination, dispute resolution, and interpretations of the Plan's provisions. Reasonable decisions based on the Plan terms and claim-specific facts are required. After exhausting internal appeals, you can seek court review under ERISA Section 502(a) for any disagreed determinations; the court will apply an unspecified standard to evaluate those decisions (GUAR-1, 6/27/2012).

According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf on pages 36, rows 5 and 6, the Indiana Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association assumes coverage for certain insurance policies when an insurer faces impairment or insolvency. This applies specifically to Group Term Life, Accidental Death & Dismemberment, Short-Term Disability, Long-Term Disability, and Hospital Indemnity policies. Coverage is provided up to specific limits: $300,000 for group term life and AD&D, $100,000 for short-term disability, $60,000 for long-term disability, and $300 per day for hospital indemnity.

However, this coverage does not extend to group term life and AD&D policies with a face amount greater than $300,000, or any policy that provides a cash or refund option.
