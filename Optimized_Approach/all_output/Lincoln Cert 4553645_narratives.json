The Elimination Period: a. begins on the first day of Disability; and b. is satisfied when the required number of days is accumulated within a period which does not exceed two times the Elimination Period. During a period of Disability, the Insured Employee may return to full-time work, at his or her own or any other occupation, for an accumulated number of days not to exceed the Elimination Period. 2.

        "content": "GENERAL PROVISIONS ENTIRE CONTRACT .  The entire contract between the parties shall consist of: 1. the Policy and any amendments to it; 2. the Policyholder's application (a copy of which is attached to the Policy); 3. any Participating Employers' applications or Participation Agreements; and 4. any individual applications of the Insured Employees. In the absence of fraud, all statements made by the Policyholder and by Insured Employees are representations and not warranties.  No statement made by an Insured Employee will be used to contest the coverage provided by the Policy, unless: 1. it is contained in a written statement signed by that Insured Employee; and 2. a copy of the statement has been furnished to that Insured Employee. TIME LIMIT ON CERTAIN DEFENSES .  After the Policy has been in effect for 2 years from its date of issue, no statement of the Policyholder shall be used to void the Policy; and no statement by any Employee on a written application for insurance shall be used to reduce or deny a claim after his or her insurance coverage, with respect to which claim has been made, has been in effect 2 years or more. RESCISSION .  The Company may not rescind any insurance for an Insured Employee without such Employee's written consent, except: 1. where such Employee commits fraud or misrepresentation with respect to eligibility or any other material fact.  (However, the rescission must not be based upon the failure of the Employee to meet the eligibility requirements, if the Policyholder requested that the Company include the Employee under the coverage); or 2. where the rescission is solely due to the lack of advance notification of the Employee's termination of employment. A  \"Material Misrepresentation\"  is an incomplete or untrue statement that caused the Company to issue coverage that it would have disapproved, had it known the truth.   \"To rescind\"  means to cancel insurance back to its effective date.  In that event, the Company will refund all premium paid for the rescinded insurance, less any benefits paid for the Insured Employee's claims.  The Company reserves the right to recover any claims paid in excess of such premiums. MISSTATEMENT OF AGE .  If an Insured Employee's age has been misstated, any benefits shall be in the amount the paid premium would have purchased at the correct age. POLICYHOLDER'S AGENCY .  For all purposes of the Policy, the Policyholder acts on its own behalf or as the Employee's agent.  Under no circumstances will the Policyholder be deemed the Company's agent. CURRENCY .  In administering the Policy: 1. all Predisability Income will be expressed in U.S. dollars; and 2. all premium and benefit amounts must be paid in U.S. dollars. WORKERS' COMPENSATION OR STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE .  The Policy does not replace or provide benefits required by: 1. Workers' Compensation laws; or 2. any state disability insurance plan laws. ASSIGNMENT .  The rights and benefits under this Certificate may not be assigned.",

RETIREMENT PLAN  means a defined benefit or defined contribution plan that: 1. provides Retirement Benefits to Employees; and 2. is not funded wholly by Employee contributions. The term shall  not  include any 401(k), profit-sharing or thrift plan; informal salary continuance plan; individual retirement account (IRA); tax sheltered annuity (TSA); stock ownership plan; or a non-qualified plan of deferred compensation. An Employer's Retirement Plan is deemed to include any Retirement Plan: 1. which is part of any federal, state, county, municipal or association retirement system; and 2. for which the Insured Employee is eligible as a result of employment with the Employer. SICK LEAVE  or  SALARY CONTINUANCE PLAN  means a plan that: 1. is established and maintained by the Employer for the benefit of Employees; and 2. continues payment of all or part of an Insured Employee's Predisability Income for a specified period after he or she becomes Disabled. It does  not  include compensation the Employer pays an Insured Employee for work actually performed during a Disability. SICKNESS  means illness, pregnancy or disease. TOTAL COVERED PAYROLL  means the total amount of Basic Monthly Earnings for all Employees insured under the Policy. TOTAL DISABILITY or TOTALLY DISABLED  will be defined as follows. 1.

The loss of a professional license, an occupational license or certification, or a driver's license for any reason does  not , by itself, constitute Total Disability. WAITING PERIOD  means the period of time an Employee must be employed in an eligible class with the Employer, before he or she becomes eligible to enroll for coverage under the Policy.  The period of service must be continuous, except as explained in the Eligibility provision captioned Prior Service Credit Towards Waiting Period.",
