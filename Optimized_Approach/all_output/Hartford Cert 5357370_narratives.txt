This Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf document on pages 11 and 37 clarifies continuity of coverage from a prior policy.

According to the Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, the maximum monthly disability benefit is the least of three options: $6,000, the Benefit Percentage (60%) times your Pre-disability Earnings with premium paid, or the same percentage times your Pre-disability Earnings. The benefits are calculated differently based on whether your current earnings are 20% or less of your Indexed Pre-disability Earnings: If they are, we will determine your monthly benefit by multiplying your pre-disability earnings by the Benefit Percentage, comparing the result to the Maximum Benefit, and deducting Other Income Benefits. If your current earnings exceed 20%, we will calculate your monthly benefit for up to 12 consecutive months in the same manner. Your Current Monthly Earnings will not reduce your monthly benefit, but if their sum with your monthly benefit exceeds 100% of your Pre-disability Earnings, we will reduce your monthly benefit by the excess amount. The Seat Belt Benefit and Air Bag Benefit are both less than the corresponding Principal Sum multiplied by their respective percentages or the Maximum Amount for these benefits. If it cannot be determined whether you were wearing a Seat Belt at the time of Accident, a Minimum Benefit will be payable under the Seat Belt Benefit. The Repatriation Benefit pays the least of actual expenses for body preparation and transportation, benefit percentage times your Principal Sum, or the Maximum Amount for this Benefit; specific amounts are shown in the Schedule of Insurance.

According to Hartford Cert 5357370.pdf, disability benefits are calculated based on pre-disability earnings. If you remain disabled after the elimination period and earn less than 20% of your indexed pre-disability earnings, your monthly benefit is determined by multiplying your pre-disability earnings by the benefit percentage, comparing the result with the maximum benefit, deducting any other income benefits, and using the lesser amount as your monthly benefit. If you earn more than 20%, your monthly benefit will be calculated for up to 12 consecutive months in the same manner. Current monthly earnings will not reduce your monthly benefit, but if the sum of your monthly benefit and current monthly earnings exceeds 100% of your pre-disability earnings, your monthly benefit will be reduced by the amount of excess.
