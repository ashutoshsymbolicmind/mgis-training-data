According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 11 and 12, your insurance coverage or increase in coverage will be deferred if you're absent from work due to accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse, or pregnancy, on the date your insurance would otherwise have started. The effective date for coverage will be delayed until you actively return to work for a full day. This exception applies to situations where the absence occurs within 12 days before the scheduled start date of your policy or increased coverage.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, your insurance coverage may vary with a change in class or pre-disability earnings. An increase in coverage requires you to be an active employee and not absent due to disability on the day of change. If absent, the effective date will defer until you return to work for one full day. The Guaranteed Issue Amount limits all increases, but after Evidence of Insurability approval beyond this limit, further increases will only need additional evidence if they exceed 10% or have been 3 years since last approval. Notifications of changes in pre-disability earnings are effective upon receipt. An Employer-initiated change in policy becomes effective on the date of the change, subject to deferred effective date and pre-existing conditions limitations.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, if you were insured under a prior policy and ineligible for benefits on the day before the current policy's effective date, no deferred effective date applies. If you transitioned from the prior policy to the current one on the effective date and had coverage in the prior policy the day before, the pre-existing condition limitation ends on the earliest of either the policy effective date if there was no such restriction under the prior policy or the date the restriction would have ended had the prior policy remained active. The monthly benefit for a pre-existing condition will be the lesser of what was paid by the prior policy or the current policy's provision. The pre-existing conditions limitation applies after the effective date to any increase in benefits resulting from switching policies, changing options, classes, or the policy itself. If you received disability benefits under the prior policy and returned to work before the current policy's effective date, and subsequently have a recurrence of the same disability within 6 months of returning to work, covered without an elimination period under the prior policy, the elimination period under the current policy will be waived.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, your coverage terminates on the earliest occasion of:

1. The policy termination date.
2. The point when the policy no longer covers your specified class.
3. Premium payment due dates that are not met.
4. The final day of a premium contribution period you're required to pay.
5. Your employer ending your employment or you ceasing to be an active employee in an eligible class for any reason, excluding continuation provisions.

The coverage persists only if extended according to any Continuation Provisions.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, coverage can be extended beyond termination if your employer provides a uniform plan and pays premiums. Continued coverage is subject to Policy reductions, terminates upon Policy or class termination, and maintains your benefit level as of the day before continuation.

Leave of absence (except Family/Medical) allows 30 days' continuation post-commencement; FMLA/similar leave provides up to 12 weeks' continuation. Sabbatical leaves for Classes 1 and 3 offer coverage until the 12th month following sabbatical commencement, with pre-approval required for sabbaticals exceeding 30 days. Continuation ceases immediately upon leave termination prior to agreed duration.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 14, rows 2-6, if you become disabled and cease being an active employee, your insurance will continue during the Elimination Period as long as you remain disabled by the same disability. After this period, coverage is maintained for as long as you are entitled to benefits under the policy. The Elimination Period's length may vary depending on the specific details of your case.
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 14, rows 2-6, premiums will not be required once the elimination period has passed and as long as benefits continue to be disbursed during the disability period. This waiver of premium applies only after the elimination period ends. The policy does not specify a fixed duration for this exemption; however, it continues as long as benefits remain payable. It's essential to note that this provision is applicable solely to you, the policyholder, during the disability phase.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, if you are receiving disability benefits and the policy terminates, these benefits will continue as long as your disability persists using the same definition. However, benefits will not be provided beyond the date when payments would have ceased had the insurance remained active. The termination of the policy for any reason does not affect this provision's liability. In essence, if the policy ends but you remain disabled by the same condition, your benefits will continue until the disability ends or the date that benefits would have stopped had the policy remained active, whichever comes first.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf (pages 14-15), if your insurance terminates due to employment ending (non-retirement) or ineligibility from an eligible class, and you've been continuously insured for at least 12 months, are under the Policy Age Limit, can perform duties of your Occupation, the policy/class has not terminated, you're not eligible for another class or similar benefits, then you're eligible to enroll in a group long-term disability conversion policy. To convert, send a written request within 31 days, including payment of the premium and enrollment fee. Coverage will be issued without evidence of insurability, effective the day after termination, and terms may vary based on time of enrollment. If eligible, a certificate of insurance under the conversion policy will be issued.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 15, rows 2-12, this policy provides disability benefits for the policyholder if they become disabled while insured and meet certain conditions. The policyholder must be disabled throughout the Elimination Period, remain disabled beyond it, and submit proof of loss to the insurance company. Benefits start on the first day following the Elimination Period and are paid monthly. However, these benefits will not exceed the Maximum Duration of Benefits.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, if your disability is due to mental illness from any cause, related conditions, alcoholism, or non-medical substance abuse (narcotics, sedatives, stimulants, hallucinogens, etc.), there's a limit on the maximum duration of benefits. Payments will be made: 1) while you're confined in a hospital or medical care facility for your disabling condition; or 2) if not confined, after discharge and during ongoing disability, for a total of 24 months across all such disabilities throughout your lifetime.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf (page 15, rows [2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3]), if you recover from disability but then become disabled again within 180 days due to the same or a related cause while the policy remains active, these separate periods will be considered one continuous period of disability. However, if you are not disabled for 180 days or more, any subsequent disability will be treated as a new one, subject to a fresh elimination period and a new maximum duration of benefits, and all other policy terms in effect at that time will apply. Any periods of recovery during the elimination period that last less than half its length will not extend the elimination period.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf at pages 15, rows 2 and 1, the term "Recover" or "Recovery" denotes that the insured individual is no longer disabled and has resumed employment with their original employer while premiums are still being paid under Class 1. This suggests a return to work for the disabled claimant within this specific context without any loss of benefits in the stated class, assuming the conditions are met as per policy stipulations.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, if you become permanently disabled and earn 20% or less of your pre-disability earnings, your monthly disability benefits are calculated by multiplying your pre-disability earnings with the benefit percentage. This multiplied amount is then compared with the maximum benefit; the lesser amount is used, subtracting any other income benefits to determine your final monthly benefit.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, during the Disability period, if you earn more than 20% of your Pre-disability Earnings, your Monthly Benefit is calculated as follows: multiply your Pre-Disability Earnings by the Benefit Percentage, compare the result with the Maximum Benefit, and from the lesser amount, deduct Other Income Benefits. The result is Your Monthly Benefit. Current Monthly Earnings will not reduce it. However, if the sum of your Monthly Benefit and your Current Monthly Earnings exceeds 100% of your Pre-disability Earnings, we will reduce your Monthly Benefit by the excess amount. The 12 consecutive month period starts on either the day you first start work earning more than 20% or the end of the Elimination Period. If you're not under the Return to Work Incentive but earn over 20%, we will calculate your Monthly Benefit using either the Proportionate Loss Formula or the 50% Offset Formula, whichever is greater. This period starts when you're disabled and earning more than 20%.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf (page 16, row 5), the policy outlines an Indexed Pre-disability Earnings benefit. This benefit is payable if you become disabled and are not earning more than 20% of your pre-disability earnings. The benefit amount is indexed, meaning it adjusts over time based on changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). To qualify for this benefit, you must provide evidence of your pre-disability earnings, which will be adjusted according to the CPI at the time of disability and annually thereafter. This benefit continues until you are no longer disabled or reach the policy's maximum period of payment.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf document outlines the Monthly Benefit (W) in case of disability, limiting payments if you earn more than 20% of your pre-disability earnings. The benefit is indexed, meaning it may adjust over time based on changes to cost-of-living. To be eligible, you must not exceed this 20% income threshold during your disability period. This information can be found on page 16, row 3 of the certificate.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf (page 16, rows 1-5, 1-2, 1), it is stated that if the sum of your Monthly Benefit, Current Monthly Earnings, and Other Income Benefits exceeds 100% of your Pre-disability Earnings, the excess will be deducted from your Monthly Benefit. However, your Monthly Benefit will never fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit. Additionally, overpayments may be subject to recovery in accordance with the Overpayment Recovery provision. For Classes 2 and 3, specifics apply.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on page 17, row 5, your monthly benefit in the event of disability will be based on your Indexed Pre-disability Earnings, provided they do not exceed 20% of your pre-disability earnings. This percentage is crucial, as earning more than this could impact your eligibility for benefits. The Indexed Pre-disability Earnings are adjusted annually to account for changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This adjustment ensures your benefit amount keeps pace with inflation.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf (page 17), it is stated that if the sum of your Monthly Benefit, Current Monthly Earnings, and Other Income Benefits exceeds 100% of your Pre-disability Earnings, your Monthly Benefit will be reduced by the excess amount. However, your benefit will never fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit. If an overpayment occurs, they may recover all or part of it according to their Overpayment Recovery provision.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, your Monthly Benefit under this policy will never fall below the specified Minimum Monthly Benefit as outlined in the Schedule of Insurance (page 17, row 2). The minimum amount ensures a certain level of financial support during your policy period. This Minimum Monthly Benefit serves as a safety net to prevent any significant reduction in benefits provided under this contract.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 17 and 18, if a Monthly Benefit is payable for a period less than a month, the calculated benefit will be 1/30 of the Monthly Benefit for each day you are disabled. This means that if your disability lasts for 15 days, for instance, you would receive (15/30) of your Monthly Benefit. This applies to rows [2, 3, 1].
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on page 18 rows [2-23], your benefit payments will cease upon the earliest of nine circumstances:

1. Your disability status change.
2. Insufficient proof of loss submission.
3. Discontinuation of regular medical care unless further treatment is deemed unnecessary.
4. Refusal to undergo requested physician examination or other professional evaluation.
5. Your demise.
6. Refusal of recommended treatment generally accepted by physicians as curative, corrective, or beneficial for your disabling condition.
7. The last day benefits are payable according to the Maximum Duration of Benefits Table.
8. If you're receiving occupation-based disability benefits, your current monthly earnings exceeding 80% of your indexed pre-disability earnings.
9. Any provision in the policy limiting benefit duration takes effect.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, if you're participating in a Rehabilitation program and incur Family Care expenses for children under age 13 or dependent, mentally or physically handicapped family members, these costs will be deducted from your rehabilitation earnings. The maximum monthly deduction per qualifying child or family member is $350 during the first 12 months of Rehab and $175 thereafter, not exceeding your monthly earnings. This deduction may not surpass a total of $2,500 annually, and it will be reduced proportionally for periods less than a month. Caregiver receipts are required to document charges, and this deduction ends when you exit the Rehabilitation program or after 24 months of Family Care Credits during your Disability. Family Care provided by relatives is ineligible as a deduction under this provision. Your post-deduction current monthly earnings determine your Monthly Benefit, and you won't be eligible for a Monthly Benefit if your pre-deduction earnings exceed 80% of your Indexed Pre-disability Earnings.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf pages [18, 19], if you're receiving a Monthly Disability Benefit at the time of your death, a Survivor Income Benefit will be paid upon receipt of satisfactory proof of death and entitlement to the benefit within one year of your demise. The beneficiary can either be your surviving spouse, your children (in equal shares if no spouse), or your estate if neither exists. The Survivor Income Benefit is three times your Maximum Monthly Benefit. To change or designate a beneficiary, a written notice must be filed with us on any satisfactory form, and any changes take effect as of the date you signed the notice. Overpayments will first be applied to the Survivor Income Benefit. If no written notice is received, we are not liable for benefit payments.
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf (page 19, rows 2-4), a "Spouse" may be either your legally married wife or husband at the time of your death, or your domestic partner if you have executed an acceptable domestic partner affidavit and continue to meet its requirements. To be considered a domestic partner for The Policy, you must submit a valid affidavit establishing that you and your partner are recognized as such. Your designation as a domestic partner will persist so long as you adhere to the conditions described in the affidavit.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, a Surviving Child is defined as your unmarried, biologically or adopted offspring who either reside with you in a parent-child relationship and were eligible to be claimed as dependents on your last federal income tax return prior to your death, or are primarily dependent on you for support and maintenance. This includes children under age 21, as well as those aged 21 to 25 who are enrolled full-time at an educational institution. If a minor child is entitled to benefits, the insurance company may opt to make payments to their caregiver until a legal guardian is appointed.
<EOS>
According to the Workplace Modification Benefit section from Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, if your disability is covered and your employer agrees to make necessary modifications to accommodate your return to work, the insurer will reimburse these costs up to the amount of the Maximum Monthly Benefit item. Approval for such modifications requires written consent from the insurer. The insurer may choose to evaluate you by a physician, vocational expert, or rehabilitation specialist before approval. Reimbursement occurs after the proposed modifications are completed, proof of expenses is provided, and you return as an Active Employee. This benefit is applicable only if your disability is covered under the policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf (page 19, rows 2-3), Workplace Modification refers to alterations in your work environment or job performance methods, aimed at enabling you to execute the essential duties of your position while disabled. Payment of this benefit does not diminish or exclude any other benefits you're entitled to under the policy's terms.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, this policy offers a Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) after 12 consecutive months of disability. To be eligible, one must be receiving benefits and earning less than 20% of pre-disability earnings. The COLA is adjusted annually on January 1st using the lesser of 3% or the full percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The formula multiplies this percentage by the Monthly Benefit for Disability and adds it to the existing benefit. However, these adjustments cease upon cessation of disability or termination of the policy.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, rows [2, 3, 4, 1, 2] on page 20, details the Consumer Price Index (CPI-W), published monthly by the U.S. Department of Labor. The index measures urban wage earners and clerical workers' expenses for specific goods and services. If discontinued or changed, an equivalent nationally published index will be used instead. For this benefit, the CPI-W percentage change is calculated as the difference between July 31's CPI-W of the current year and the prior year, divided by the prior year's CPI-W.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf outlines the Infectious and Contagious Disease Benefit. To qualify for this benefit, you must provide verification that you carry an infectious and contagious disease listed by the Center for Disease Control as life-threatening; tested positive for it after the policy's effective date; have suffered a 20% or greater loss of earnings due to limitations on your license, reduced patronage, or loss of patients resulting from disclosure of the disease; and never refused immunization against the specific disease.

The benefit is calculated as follows: (Pre-disability Earnings - Current Monthly Earnings) x (Maximum Benefit payable under the Policy) = Your Infectious and Contagious Disease Benefit, payable monthly. The benefit will cease on the earliest of your death, disability eligibility, our determination that you have not made efforts to continue working in your occupation, your refusal to participate in seeking suitable alternate work, or the policy's maximum duration of benefits.
<EOS>
Under the Progressive Illness Benefit outlined in Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, if you are diagnosed with a progressive illness after becoming covered for this benefit and provide proof from your physician, you may become eligible to receive this benefit. The coverage requires that you have been covered by the policy, and upon diagnosis of a progressive illness, you must supply satisfactory proof from your physician to qualify. The specifics of the benefit details are not provided in these sections but can be found elsewhere in the document.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf policy section details a Progressive Illness disability benefit. A non-infectious, prolonged disease or disorder, progressively impacting one's ability to perform their own occupation, qualifies as a Progressive Illness. If disabled due to such an illness, your pre-disability earnings will be the greater of two options: the earnings at the time you provide proof of your progressive illness from your physician, or the earnings at the time of disability under this policy. Disability benefits are calculated using these determined earnings and adhering to the policy's terms effective on the disability date. Premiums will be based on either pre-disability earnings for this benefit or for the entire policy before disability occurs until you meet the disability criteria, with premiums not dropping below the amount at proof of illness submission unless you qualify for Waiver of Premium.
<EOS>
Under the Accidental Dismemberment and Loss of Sight Benefit in The Hartford's policy (Cert 5408131), if you sustain a bodily injury due to an accident within the coverage period, we will pay a monthly benefit for any of the listed losses that occur within 90 days after the accident. The benefit is payable only when the loss persists for at least the specified number of months indicated in the policy. The benefits are as follows:

- Loss of hand or foot: A monthly benefit for 60 months if total and permanent loss occurs.
- Loss of sight in one eye: A monthly benefit for 60 months if total and permanent loss occurs.
- Loss of two or more fingers at wrist or more than one toe at ankle: A monthly benefit for 48 months if total and permanent loss occurs.
- Loss of thumb, big toe, or sight in one eye: A monthly benefit for 24 months if total and permanent loss occurs.

These benefits begin after an elimination period and are subject to the terms and conditions outlined in the policy.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf outlines various minimum number of monthly benefit payments for different types of loss scenarios. For instance, the full amount is payable if both eyes, both hands, or both feet are lost; if one hand and one foot, one hand and one eye, or one foot and one eye are lost, a reduced payment is made. Similarly, a partial payment is given for losing one hand or one foot, while the least compensation is provided for losing one eye. Additionally, there's a specific payment for the thumb and index finger of either hand.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, loss refers primarily to the actual severance of hands, feet, or specific fingers (hands and feet through or above wrist/ankle joints; eyes, entire and irrecoverable; thumb and index finger through or above metacarpophalangeal joints) as a result of an accident. If multiple losses occur from the same incident, the number of monthly benefit payments is limited to the loss with the greatest number of payments indicated in the schedule. Benefit payments may continue if the policyholder remains disabled after the Minimum Number of Monthly Benefit Payments has been reached. If death occurs before the minimum number of payments are made during the Elimination Period, remaining payments will be made to the estate.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, benefits will not be paid for any disability under this policy if the claimant is not under regular medical care, or if the disability is caused by war or act of war (declared or undeclared), commission or attempt of a felony, illegal occupation, self-inflicted injury, or if benefits were received or were eligible from a prior employer-sponsored disability plan that was terminated before the policy's effective date.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 22, rows 2-8, the policy does not cover any benefits or increases for disabilities resulting from pre-existing conditions, unless the insured has not received medical care for that condition during the past six consecutive months while under the policy, or has been continuously insured for twelve consecutive months prior to becoming disabled.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf (page 22, rows 2-11), any pre-existing conditions including injuries, sicknesses, mental illnesses, pregnancies, or substance abuse issues are not covered if they resulted in medical care during the 6 months preceding either your effective date of coverage or a change in coverage. This includes manifestations, symptoms, findings, or aggravations relating to these conditions.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 22 rows 2-5, medical care is covered when a physician or healthcare provider consults, gives advice, recommends, prescribes, or provides treatment. The policy pays for necessary and reasonable medical services, which include diagnostic tests, surgery, hospital stays, and other related costs. However, services that are experimental or investigational are not covered. Pre-existing conditions may be excluded unless specifically waived by the policy. The policy also covers emergency services received within 48 hours of an accident or sudden illness. The percentage of coverage varies depending on the specific policy details.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, on pages 22 and pertinent rows [2, 3, 4, 5], the treatment encompasses medical examinations, tests, attendance, or observation; it also includes utilizing drugs, medicines, medical services, supplies, or equipment. These treatments are subject to approval and reimbursement within the coverage limits defined by the policy. Reasonable and customary charges apply based on the geographic region where treatment is received. Additionally, the plan has provisions for prior authorization requirements for specific treatments.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, page 22, rows 2-4, when a claim arises due to disability or loss, you must promptly provide written, electronic, or telephonic notice within thirty days. If providing notice within that timeframe isn't feasible, you should do so as soon as practically possible thereafter. Essential details to include in your notification are your name, address, and the policy number.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf document on pages 22, rows 2 and 3 outlines claim procedures. Within fifteen days of receiving a Notice of Claim, they will send Proof of Loss forms to the policyholder. If these forms are not provided within the stipulated timeframe, alternative written proof that fully describes the nature and extent of the claim can be submitted. This alternative proof should be received promptly for proper processing.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf (pages 22, 23) outlines the Proof of Loss requirements. Essential information includes:

  1. Documentation on Your Disability's start date, cause, prognosis, pre-disability earnings, current monthly income, and proof of regular physician care.

  2. Medical records, including x-rays and treatment notes, as well as details about consulted physicians, hospitals, and pharmacies.

  3. Authorization for the insurance company to access medical, employment, and financial information, as well as any other necessary data.

  4. A signed statement identifying all Other Income Benefits and proof of their application. It is noted that you will not claim retirement benefits on a reduced basis.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 23 rows [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], the policyholder must comply with the company's requests to meet and interview with their representative, or be examined by a physician, vocational expert, functional expert, or other professional of the company's choice. These interactions will be at the company's expense and as reasonably required. The policyholder's Additional Proof of Loss must satisfy the company. Failure to cooperate for a valid reason may result in denied, suspended, or terminated benefits.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 23, rows 2-11, written Proof of Loss for a claim must be sent within 90 days following the commencement of the period for which payment is liable. If proof cannot be provided in time or is delayed but later supplied within a year from its due date (unless one is not legally competent), the claim will not be affected. The insurance company may request additional Proof of Loss throughout the disability period, and it must be provided within 30 days of the request.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, if you are deemed disabled and eligible for benefits, payments will be issued at the end of each month that you're disabled. The policyholder may opt to make an advance benefit payment based on their estimated disability duration. Post-termination payments, if any, will be made upon receipt of satisfactory Proof of Loss.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 23, all payments for your claim are made directly to you. In the event of your demise, such payments may be distributed to your estate. If a payment is owed to your estate, a minor, or an incompetent person, up to $1,000 can be paid to a relative who, at the insurer's discretion, is entitled to it, fulfilling their obligation for the amount paid.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, if a claim for benefits is either fully or partially denied, written notification will be provided, outlining specific reasons for denial, referencing relevant policy provisions, describing any additional information required to complete a claim, and explaining why it's necessary. This notification also includes an explanation of the review procedure. The review process is crucial if you wish to contest the decision.
<EOS>
Within 180 days of receiving a claim denial for disability-related claims or 60 days for non-disability claims from Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf, you or your representative have the right to request a full and fair review of your denied claim. To do so, you must submit a written application detailing your appeal, provide copies of all relevant documents, records, and information, and present any additional comments, documents, or evidence pertaining to your claim. The Hartford will respond with their final decision on the claim in writing. Additionally, you have the right to request and receive copies of all documents, records, and other information related to your claim throughout this process.
<EOS>
In case of a dispute over disability benefits with The Hartford (from Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf), after our final review, you have the right to seek arbitration through the American Arbitration Association (AAA). You must initiate this process by contacting AAA's main office in Washington, D.C., requesting arbitration proceedings for employee benefit disputes. The arbitration will be conducted by a neutral, pre-approved arbitrator from AAA's panel, and both parties will equally bear the costs unless otherwise ordered by the arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision is final and binding; court judgment can be sought on the award.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 24 rows 2-8, you must apply for Social Security disability benefits when your disability lasts the minimum required duration. You have 45 days from the date of their request to submit your application. If denied, you must follow the Social Security Administration's process to reconsider the denial and, if denied again, request a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge at the Office of Hearing and Appeals.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf states that the company reserves the right to decrease disability benefits by estimating potential Social Security benefits for you or your dependents. This reduction applies if you or your dependents appear eligible for these benefits. However, your monthly benefit will not be reduced if:

  1) You apply for and pursue appeals according to Social Security regulations, and provide authorization for the Social Security Administration to share award information with them.

2) You sign a reimbursement agreement confirming that you accept repaying any overpayments.

If we reduce your monthly benefit based on an estimate and:

  1) You or your dependents later receive Social Security disability benefits, we will adjust the monthly benefit upon receiving proof of the award amount, determining if it was higher or lower than our estimate.

2) Your application for Social Security disability benefits is denied, we will make an adjustment when you provide us proof of final denial from an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Hearing and Appeals.

If our estimated Social Security Benefits were lower, and we owe you a refund, we will issue it in a lump sum. Conversely, if they were higher, and your monthly benefit has been overpaid, you must return a lump sum equal to all overpayments, as per the Overpayment Recovery provision.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf on pages 24 and 25, an overpayment occurs when the insurer determines that benefits paid exceed what is due under The Policy, or when payments are made for another group policy. This includes retroactive awards, unreported/late reported Other Income Benefits or earned income, misstatements, fraud, errors, or any other reasons. Overpayments can arise from various factors such as failure to report Other Income Benefits, late notification of earnings, or incorrect information provided.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5408131.pdf (pages 25-26) outlines the policy on overpayment recovery. The insurance company has the right to recover any determined overpayments, with the policyholder obligated to refund this amount. Overpayments on claims must be reimbursed within 30 days, or else the company can recover from the policyholder, other organizations, insurance companies, those to whom payment was made, or the policyholder's estate. Additionally, the company may reduce or offset future benefits payable until full reimbursement is made.
