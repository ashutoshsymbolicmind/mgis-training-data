Key features include Continuity of Coverage, Disability Plus, Minimum Benefit, Pre-Existing: 3/12, and a Survivor Benefit. The Survivor Benefit pays an eligible survivor a lump sum equal to 3 months of the gross disability payment if the disability lasted 180 days or more, and the policyholder was receiving payments at the time of death. If there are no eligible survivors, payment is made to the estate. No survivor benefits are payable for the Disability Plus coverage. The Waiver of Premium for Disability Plus exempts monthly premiums during LTD plan payments. In case of employment change and a switch to Unum as the insurance carrier, benefit payments end upon the earliest of specified dates, including death. No survivor benefits are payable for the Disability Plus coverage in this scenario. The policy also includes enrollment, risk management, and support services related to the Employer's Benefit Program."

First, if you are confined to a hospital or institution at the end of the 24-month period and remain so, Unum will provide ongoing payments throughout your stay, with an additional recovery period of up to 90 days following discharge.
