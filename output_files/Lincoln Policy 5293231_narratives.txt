First, if the Company verifies a complete proof of claim and liability, any monthly benefits due during their liability period will be paid in daily installments equal to 1/30th of the Monthly Benefit. If benefits are less than a month, they will be paid on a pro rata basis. Second, any remaining unpaid balance at the end of the period of liability is immediately paid upon receiving complete proof of claim and liability confirmation. This policy is outlined in rows [62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 1, 5, 6] on pages [13, 14].

<EOS>
This section from Lincoln Policy 5293231 outlines the procedure for a claim denial notice. If any part of a claim is denied, the Insured Employee receives a written explanation within 15 days after the Company resolves the claim or within 45 days upon receipt of the first proof of claim, if feasible.

This notice details the appeal process and crucial claim information.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on page [14], the company may take more than 15 days to process a claim due to unforeseen circumstances. If additional time is needed, an extension will be granted, and the insured employee will receive a written delay notice by the 15th day after the initial proof of claim submission. Subsequently, the employee will receive updates every 30 days until resolution. The notice will provide details on required information for liability determination and an estimated decision timeline.

Under Lincoln Policy 5293231, if an issue arises concerning a claim decision, the ERISA law requires exhaustion of administrative remedies. A participant or beneficiary must initiate two internal reviews of the adverse claim decision in accordance with this section. Once these required reviews are completed, the ERISA plan participant or beneficiary may file a legal action under Section 502(a) if dissatisfied with the outcome. This process is outlined within the specified policy page numbers [15] and rows [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29].
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf reveals that in cases where a claim is denied based on the exhaustion of administrative remedies, the Company will forgo any argument asserting failure to exhaust such remedies.

Additionally, the policy caps the amount that can be recovered under this provision at 365 days' worth of benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, if overpayments occur on short-term or long-term disability benefits, full reimbursement is required within 60 days. Failure to repay allows the company to either reduce future benefits or suspend the Minimum Monthly Benefit, adjust group insurance policies issued by them, or recover the overpayment from the employee or estate. This applies regardless of whether the overpayment stems from their processing error, the employee receiving Other Income Benefits, fraud, misrepresentation, omission of facts, or any other reason. The reimbursement is necessary for errors, income benefits, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other cause.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 15 (rows 58-59), any legal action to recover benefits must wait for a minimum of 60 days following the submission of written proof of claim.

This information from Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf outlines the Company's discretionary authority over the policy. The Company can manage, interpret, administer claims, and resolve questions under this policy.

For instance, some plans require a 30-day waiting period, while others might have a different duration. Employees are advised to review their specific plan details for accurate information regarding the Waiting Period.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, prior service credit can be applied towards the waiting period under specific conditions. If a former employee is rehired within one year after their employment ends, or if an employee returns from an approved Family or Medical Leave (either the 12-week leave required by federal law or any longer period mandated by similar state law) or Military Leave (as per federal USERRA law), this prior service can be considered. These instances shorten the waiting period shown in the Schedule of Benefits.

This Lincoln Policy 5293231 specifies the effective dates for an employee's coverage and any subsequent changes. The initial coverage becomes effective at 12:01 a.m. on the first or next Insurance Month following the employee's eligibility, their return to Active Work, or application for coverage submission and approval of necessary forms. Increased or additional coverage takes effect at the latest of these dates if the employee is Actively at Work, resumes Active Work, or provides approved Evidence of Insurability. Decreases in coverage take effect on the day of the change regardless of the employee's work status. The payroll deduction order or Flexible Benefits Plan account may be used for premium payments as needed.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf, Evidence of Insurability is necessary under the following circumstances: when an employee applies for coverage or increased coverage more than 31 days after eligibility; when an employee requests to cancel insurance, stop payroll deductions, or premium payments from the Flexible Benefits Plan account; if coverage lapses due to non-payment of premium; and when optional, supplemental, or voluntary coverage exceeds any Guaranteed Issue Amounts in the Schedule of Benefits.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf on pages 17, rows 1, 4, and 5 outlines the Long-Term Disability (LTD) benefits under GL3001-LTD-9. The policy becomes effective on January 1, 2016. Benefits are payable if you become totally disabled due to sickness or injury, preventing you from performing the duties of your regular occupation for at least 90 days.

The benefit amount is 60% of your monthly base salary, subject to a maximum of $15,000 per month and a minimum of $500 per month. The policy has an elimination period of either 90 or 180 days, as chosen by you at the time of enrollment.

If you elect the 180-day elimination period, you will receive your first benefit payment once you have been continuously disabled for 180 days. If you choose the 90-day elimination period, payments begin after 90 days of continuous disability but only if you are also on a company-approved leave of absence during that time.

The policy offers additional benefits to cover any expenses associated with the recovery process up to $50,000 per event for certain approved procedures and services. The policy terminates at age 65 or upon your return to work, whichever occurs first.

This includes breaks in service, leaves for family or medical reasons (federal law compliant or state law-extended), military leave, any other approved leave of absence within six months, layoff, or termination within 12 months for any reason. Reinstatement does not require a new waiting period or evidence of insurability. The reinstated coverage can only equal the amount that originally terminated and takes effect on the date the employee returns to active work.

Pre-existing condition exclusion periods are considered during reinstatement, with leave months counting towards any unmet pre-existing condition exclusion period. A new pre-existing condition exclusion will not apply to the reinstated coverage; however, a new one will be applied to any increased amount of insurance. The employee must apply for or be re-enrolled within 31 days following their return to active work in an eligible class. This policy applies to GL3001-LTD-10 as of 01/01/13.

According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, under Continuation Rights, if an insured employee ceases active work, the insurance coverage terminates. However, continuation of coverage is possible under certain conditions:

- For up to 6 months after cessation of employment, the employee can elect COBRA continuation coverage for themselves and their eligible dependents. This requires payment of 102% of the premium, which includes a 2% administration fee.

- If the employee is disabled within 365 days of termination and meets specific requirements, they may qualify for extended coverage up to 29 months under the Disability Extension provision.

- Additionally, if the employer becomes bankrupt, or if the plan terminates, employees and their families may continue coverage under the federal continuation provisions. These provisions mandate that coverage be offered for up to 18 months, with the employee responsible for paying 102% of the premium.
<EOS>
Under the Lincoln Policy 5293231, disability coverage continues during the Elimination Period, if the Company receives premiums from the Employer. Afterward, coverage endures for the duration of benefits payment without premium charges. Premium waiver applies from satisfying the Elimination Period to the period benefits are payable. If coverage continues post-waived premium periods, regular premium payments must resume upon their due date. Essentially, disability insurance can be maintained throughout the Elimination Period and the time for which benefits are disbursed, with premiums waived until benefits cessation; however, reinstatement of premiums is necessary after such periods.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, if an Insured Employee takes approved Family or Medical Leave, coverage can be continued until the earliest of: a) the end of the leave period granted by the employer; b) 12 weeks mandated by federal law or a more lenient state law; c) when the employee informs the employer they will not return; or d) their start date at a new job. The employer must provide premium payments throughout this continued coverage period.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 18, rows 64, 65, and 67, if an insured employee goes on Military Leave, coverage may be continued for the same duration as an approved Family or Medical Leave.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 18 and 19, in the event of a temporary lay-off or an approved leave of absence (excluding Family or Medical Leave and Military Leave), coverage can be maintained for three Insurance Months.

<EOS>
This Lincoln Policy 5293231 detail stipulates that continuation coverage should not discriminate among employees in similar employment situations.

These conditions apply exclusively on pages 19, rows 5 and 6 of the policy document.
<EOS>
Under Lincoln Policy 5293231, if an insured employee becomes disabled, termination of their coverage will not impact benefits payable for the duration of that disability. This provision ensures continuous coverage and benefit payments during this critical period. It is essential to note that any subsequent changes in employment status or policy terms will be subject to respective conditions and timelines as specified within the policy. The policy does not explicitly state a specific timeframe for this Disability coverage, implying it could continue until the disability ends or a policy review occurs. This provision applies only to the insured employee's coverage, and any dependents' coverage would be subject to separate terms and conditions.

According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, the insurer may terminate this policy under specific circumstances. These include providing a 60-day written notice if the group policyholder decides to do so. The insurer can also terminate immediately on the due date of any premium when:

The policyholder remains liable for paying premiums up to the termination date.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf, if a premium is not paid before the end of the Grace Period, the policy will automatically terminate at that point without any action from the company. The policyholder remains liable for all unpaid premiums up until the date of termination. This implies that failure to pay on time could lead to policy termination and ongoing financial responsibility.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 19 and 20, during a disability, an insured employee's participation will not impact the benefits payable for that period of disability. This policy abides by GL3001-LTD-11 04 LA 19 01/01/13 guidelines, meaning benefits are payable regardless of participation. This provision is effective on rows 54, 55, 1, 3, and 4.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, coverage under this policy is only effective upon payment of the first premium. To maintain coverage, the employer must pay each subsequent premium by its due date at the Company's Group Insurance Service Office. Premium payments should be made in U.S. dollars.

This information from Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf details premium rate change rules across various scenarios. The company may alter premium rates on specified dates, such as the policy's anniversary or any premium due date. Notably, no rate hikes are permitted within the first 12 months, with subsequent adjustments limited to once every six months thereafter.

Critical changes may occur when the policyholder relocates, dissolves, merges, or is added/removed from the policy; ceases state Workers’ Compensation coverage, Salary Continuance Plan benefits, or Sick Leave provisions; or alters the number of Insured Employees by 25% or more. Premium rate changes also apply when new individuals are covered, benefit levels increase, or there are age or geographic location changes.

The company must provide at least 45 days' written notice before enacting any premium rate increase, with a minimum of 45 days if the hike exceeds 20%. No other formatting is specified in this section.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf, the monthly premium due date is determined by multiplying Covered Payroll with the premium rate.

This information from Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf outlines the Total Disability Monthly Benefit. To qualify, an Insured Employee must complete the Elimination Period while being Totally Disabled, under a Physician's Regular Care, and submitting proof of continued disability upon request. The benefit ceases when the Insured Employee recovers, dies, reaches the Maximum Benefit Period, or chooses not to engage in Partial Disability Employment exceeding 20% of their former earning capacity, depending on the timeframe. Proportional benefits are given for partial months of disability. The Company may deny or suspend payments if the Insured Employee fails to comply with medical exams, cooperate with examiners, postpone required exams more than twice, delays additional proof by 45 days, refuses vocational rehabilitation without good cause (if included), or fails to participate in a good faith approved vocational rehabilitation program.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf details the Total Disability Monthly Benefit. The benefit equals the lesser of the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings multiplied by the Benefit Percentage (limited by the Maximum Monthly Benefit) or 70% of their Basic Monthly Earnings, minus Other Income Benefits. The Benefit Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period can be found in the Schedule of Benefits. The minimum monthly benefit will not be less than a specific amount unless combining it with Other Income Benefits would exceed 100% of the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings. This plan falls under Plan 2 Advantage GL3001-LTD-12 10 LA Any Occ, Standard Integration, issued on 01/01/13.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, the Total Disability Monthly Benefit is calculated by multiplying the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings by the Benefit Percentage, limited by the Maximum Monthly Benefit. However, this amount will not fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit unless the sum of the Minimum Monthly Benefit and Other Income Benefits does not exceed 100% of the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings. The specific percentages, maximums, minimums, and duration (Maximum Benefit Period) can be found in the Schedule of Benefits. If these calculations result in a benefit that is greater than the Minimum Monthly Benefit plus Other Income Benefits equaling 100% of the Basic Monthly Earnings, the actual benefit will be reduced accordingly.

According to Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf, an insured employee's coverage for the Progressive Income Benefit kicks in on a specific date, as follows:

If the employee becomes eligible for Long Term Disability Benefits under this policy, their coverage begins immediately. Conversely, if this provision is added to the policy at a later time through amendment, the effective date of this addition will be stated in the amendment itself. This Progressive Income Benefit covers a portion of the employee's income, with details varying based on the employee's years of service and salary level.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 24 rows 10-16, the effective date of this benefit for an Insured Employee who is unable to perform Activities of Daily Living or suffers from a Cognitive Impairment will be delayed. The coverage commences for such an employee either: when they can safely and independently complete all daily living tasks without assistance, or upon recovery from the cognitive impairment.
<EOS>
Under the Lincoln Policy 5293231, after completing the Elimination Period stated in the Schedule of Insurance, the Company offers an additional monthly benefit to the Insured Employee. This applies if the employee is already receiving Total Disability or Partial Disability Monthly Benefits under this Policy and can prove suffering from Loss of Activities of Daily Living or Cognitive Impairment (as defined within the policy). Proof submission is at the employee's expense.
<EOS>
As per the stipulations outlined in Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 24 and rows 28-35, the Progressive Income Benefit equals 10% of an Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings. However, this benefit does not surpass the Maximum Monthly Benefit for Long Term Disability Benefits or $5,000 per month (whichever is less). The Schedule of Insurance indicates the Maximum Monthly Benefit for Long Term Disability Benefits. Crucially, the Progressive Income Benefit remains unaffected by Other Income Benefits or income derived from any form of employment.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 24 rows [38-49], the Progressive Income Benefit will terminate upon the earliest occurrence of four events: (1) the Insured Employee recovers from Loss of Activities of Daily Living or Cognitive Impairment, (2) the Insured Employee is no longer eligible for Total Disability or Partial Disability Monthly Benefits under this policy, (3) the Maximum Benefit Period concludes, or (4) the Insured Employee's death.

According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, page 24, rows 71-72, the policy addresses continence requirements. If an individual is not continent (i.e., unable to control bladder and bowel function), related personal hygiene, including catheter or colostomy bag care, is considered relevant. It's important to note that this requirement applies in all instances of non-continence. This information underscores the significance of maintaining personal hygiene when such assistance is necessary.

According to Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdfs on pages 24 and 25, under row numbers 74, 75, and 3, the definition of eating includes consuming food from a table, tray, or container (such as a bowl or cup), or using specialized equipment like feeding tubes or intravenous tubes. This implies that the policy considers various methods for getting nourishment into one's body as fulfilling this requirement. The GL3001-LTD-12D 01 plan applies to these circumstances.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, under the "Cognitive Impairment" clause, if an Insured Employee experiences a permanent deterioration or loss of cognitive or intellectual capacity due to injury or sickness, they may be eligible for benefits. This impairment must be diagnosed by a Physician using clinical evidence and standardized tests of short-term or long-term memory, orientation, and deductive reasoning. The impairment may result from moderate to severe head trauma, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, or other irreversible dementia. The affected employee requires another person's active, hands-on help or verbal cues to prevent harm to themselves or others due to this impairment.

According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 25, rows 33-35, a 'Pre-Existing Condition' refers to any illness or injury for which the policyholder sought treatment within three months prior to their benefit's effective date. Treatment encompasses physician consultations, care and services, diagnostic measures, as well as prescribed drug or medicine use, including refills. This policy provision may impact coverage for such conditions.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, page 25, row 40, this policy's disability benefit will not be payable during a period of the insured's disability that begins prior to their coverage effective date. The start date of the employee's coverage under this benefit is crucial for determining eligibility for disability benefits. This provision applies only when the onset of disability occurs before the policy's activation, rendering the benefit inaccessible during that timeframe.
<EOS>
According to the Pre-Existing Conditions section in Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 25, rows 43-49, a disability claim for Loss of Activities of Daily Living or Cognitive impairment will not be covered if it is caused or exacerbated by a pre-existing condition within the first 12 months following the Insured Employee's effective date. A pre-existing condition, as defined in this policy, is any illness or injury for which medical advice, consultation, prescription medications, surgery, or treatment recommendations were received during the six-month lookback period before the effective date, or any condition that had manifested symptoms or required medical intervention within this same period.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, disability benefits will not be payable if the cause or contribution is mental illness, alcoholism, or voluntary use of a controlled substance, unless prescribed by a Physician. Controlled Substances are those defined in Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, including any amendments. These specific details can be found on pages 25, rows 52, 53, and 54 of the policy document.

According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 25 and 26, premium payments and other provisions in this policy are subject to the Definitions (Resolution 25 01/01/13) and Exclusions. Premiums must be paid consistently, with a 30-day grace period for late payment. If a premium is unpaid after this grace period, coverage may lapse. The Waiver of Premium provision applies if the insured becomes Totally Disabled (GL3001-LTD-13) and meets other conditions. Additionally, any changes to this policy, such as benefit adjustments or coverage terminations, will follow the policy amendment process outlined within Lincoln Policy 5293231.

This Lincoln Policy 5293231 outlines the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit. To qualify, an insured employee must complete the Elimination Period while being Disabled, engaged in Partial Disability Employment with a minimum of 20% Predisability Income, under a Physician's Regular Care, and submit proof of continued Partial Disability and reduced earnings upon request. The Elimination Period can be satisfied by Total or Partial Disability days.

The Partial Disability Monthly Benefit ceases on the earliest occasion: (1) the employee recovers or dies, (2) the Maximum Benefit Period ends, (3) the employee earns more than 99% of Predisability Income for the first 24 months of disability, or 85% thereafter, (4) the employee refuses to work full-time either in their Own Occupation during the Own Occupation Period or in any occupation after this period. Proportional benefits are given for a partial month of Partial Disability.

The Company may deny or suspend Partial Disability Monthly Benefit payments if the employee (without good cause): fails to take a required medical exam, fails to cooperate with an examiner, postpones a required exam more than twice, doesn't provide additional proof within 45 days of request, refuses to apply for other income benefits, or refuses to participate in a vocational rehabilitation program if the policy includes Mandatory Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit provision.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf, under Plan 2 Advantage for Class 2 GL3001-LTD-13.4, the policy commenced on January 1st, 2013. The progressive calculation applies during the elimination period and subsequent benefit periods. For each day during the elimination period, a percentage of the monthly benefit is payable starting from the 91st day up to but excluding the 182nd day, with this percentage increasing daily by 6.67%. After the elimination period, benefits are paid as follows: for the first 3 months, 25% of the monthly benefit is paid; for the next 9 months, 50%; and thereafter, up to maximum benefit duration or return to work, 100%. This structure ensures gradual financial support during long-term disability.
<EOS>
Under the Partial Disability clause of Lincoln Policy 5293231, a monthly benefit will be provided to compensate for the insured employee's lost income during partial disability. This benefit will not surpass the Total Disability Monthly Benefit, which would normally be payable in case of total disability without any partial employment. The amount of the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit is capped at the lesser of two amounts: A or B. A refers to 60% of the Insured Employee's pre-disability earnings, while B represents the difference between their pre-disability earnings and any income earned from their partial employment. Therefore, if the former is lower, that amount will be paid as the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit. This arrangement continues until the end of the benefit period or until the employee's return to full disability status, whichever occurs first.
<EOS>
Under the Lost Income section of Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 28, rows 12 and 14, the policy outlines that any benefits received, including earnings from Partial Disability Employment, are subject to reduction by all other income. The policy defines 'Other Income' as any form of cash assistance or wage replacement, excluding Social Security disability payments or workers' compensation. This reduction is applied in such a way that the sum of Benefits and Other Income does not exceed 80% of the Insured Employee's Pre-disability Income. These calculations take effect from the date of disability. The policy also stipulates that any changes to income sources must be reported promptly, as they may impact the total amount of benefits received.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf details the Total Disability Monthly Benefit. The Insured Employee's Predisability Income is multiplied by the Benefit Percentage (limited to the Maximum Monthly Benefit) and reduced by Other Income Benefits, excluding earnings from Partial Disability Employment. The Partial Disability Monthly Benefit will never be less than the Minimum Monthly Benefit. Critical values such as the Benefit Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period can be found in the Schedule of Benefits for Plan 1 GL3001-LTD-14-INT 10 Any Occ, Prim & Fam SS Integ. This plan was effective from 01/01/13.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Policy 5293231, any additional income derived from sources such as benefits, awards, settlements, or earnings will be factored in when determining the monthly benefit for the insured employee. However, this compensation will only offset if it originates from the same disability for which a monthly benefit is payable under the policy. Exceptions to this rule are Retirement Benefits and Earnings, which need not stem from the same disability. All these income sources must adhere to the guidelines stipulated in this policy.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Policy 5293231 details coverage for job-related injuries or sicknesses. It encompasses various legal entities like Workers' Compensation and occupational disease laws, the Jones Act, the Longshoreman's and Harbor Worker's Act, Maritime Doctrine of Maintenance, Wages or Cure, as well as any substitute plans. Coverage includes benefits for partial or total temporary or permanent disability, plus vocational rehabilitation services.

According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, the policy acknowledges and adheres to any compulsory benefit acts or laws. These may include temporary disability income benefits mandated by state laws, no-fault auto insurance provisions, as well as other obligatory benefit acts or laws. The policy is designed to accommodate these requirements while providing disability income benefits. It's essential to note that the policy might have additional obligations based on regional or specific case-related compulsory acts or laws.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 32 and subsequent rows 33-36, any other group insurance plans (excluding credit or mortgage insurance) or no-fault auto plans may affect your disability income benefits eligibility. In such cases, these policies' benefit amounts will be offset against the disability income benefits under this policy, reducing the total amount you receive. The exact offset percentage is determined based on the specific terms and conditions of your other insurance plans. It is crucial to disclose all relevant group insurance coverage and no-fault auto plans to ensure an accurate calculation of your disability income benefits. Failure to do so may result in delays or reductions of your benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, sick leave or salary continuance benefits provided by an employer do not encompass vacation pay, severance pay, or payment for work performed during a disability. These benefits are distinct from the disability income benefits that an insured employee may be eligible for under the policy. The disability income benefits are not inclusive of these excluded forms of compensation.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, any Disability Benefits or Retirement Benefits received by the Insured Employee under their Employer's Retirement Plan are subject to specific rules. The policy states that if an employee retires early due to disability, their monthly benefits will be reduced by 5% for each full year or fraction thereof before the Normal Retirement Age (NRA), up to a maximum of 30%. This reduction applies only when the employee begins receiving Disability Income Benefits before reaching NRA. Additionally, any lump-sum payments made as part of the Employer's Retirement Plan will not affect the Disability Insurance coverage under this policy. Furthermore, it is noted that the terms and conditions of the Employer's Retirement Plan may supersede those outlined in this policy if there is a conflict between the two documents.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, any Government Retirement Plan benefits received will be offset by the amount we pay as your policy benefit. The offset percentage depends on the type of plan: Social Security disability benefits have a 100% offset, while all other government retirement plans (except military retirement pay) have a 66 2/3% offset. This offset begins once you start receiving both your policy benefit and government retirement benefits. Any remaining amount from your policy benefit will be paid to you, subject to the other terms and conditions of this policy.

According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, disability benefits may extend to a child in the event of an Insured Employee's disability. The policy defines disability as the inability to perform the major duties of one's regular occupation due to sickness or injury. If the employee receives total disability benefits, their child will receive 60% of the monthly base amount up to $1,500. This benefit is payable until the child turns age 26. The child must be under age 26 and unmarried at the time of the Insured Employee's disability for this provision to apply. Moreover, the child must be dependent on the Insured Employee for support, either financially or due to physical or mental incapacity.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 29 (rows 52-54), if the Insured Employee is eligible for unreduced retirement benefits, then their spouse or child may also be eligible. This applies if the retirement eligibility criteria are met and such benefit distributions commence before the Insured Employee reaches age 65. The benefit amount for these eligible dependents equals 60% of the Insured Employee's monthly unreduced retirement benefit, with a minimum payment of $1,000 per month. The maximum monthly benefit cap is 75% of the Insured Employee's monthly unreduced retirement benefit, or $50,000, whichever is less. This provision applies only to certain plans, not all Lincoln policies.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Policy 5293231 specifies that reduced retirement benefits received by the Insured Employee or their spouse due to Government Retirement Plans, such as the federal Social Security Act, Jones Act, Railroad Retirement Act, Canada Pension Plan, Quebec Pension Plan, or similar plans, will impact benefits under Plan 1 GL3001-LTD-14-INT 10 Any Occ, Prim & Fam SS Integ. This integration occurred on 01/01/13. The Government Retirement Plans encompass disability and retirement benefits from various political units or countries.

According to Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf, several sources will not be considered Other Income Benefits and will not be offset in determining disability payments:

   - Cost-of-living increases in any Other Income Benefit (excluding Earnings) that take effect after the first offset for that benefit during a period of Disability.
   - Reimbursement for hospital, medical, or surgical expenses and attorney fees and other costs associated with claiming Other Income Benefits.
   - Group credit or mortgage disability insurance benefits, early retirement benefits not under the federal Social Security Act or other Government Retirement Plan, amounts from the Employer’s Retirement Plan (representing employee contributions or received upon termination without being disabled or retired), and benefits from 401(k), profit-sharing, thrift plans, IRAs, TSAs, stock ownership plans, or non-qualified deferred compensation plans.
   - Vacation pay, holiday pay, severance pay, and disability income benefits under any individual policy, association group plan, franchise plan, or auto liability insurance policy (except no fault auto insurance).
   This information is found on pages [33, 34] and rows [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7].

According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, page 34, row 5, Income Benefits that may influence Policy benefits are subject to the following rules: if an Insured Employee receives Other Income during the Elimination Period (usually 6 months) or during the Rehabilitation Period, a proportionate offset will apply. The offset percentage equals the total Other Income divided by 75% of the Maximum Monthly Benefit Amount. If Other Income exceeds this amount, the entire Income Benefit for that month will be withheld. This offset rule does not apply to Supplemental Security Income (SSI), State Disability Insurance (SDI), or Workers' Compensation income. Additionally, any Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits received within the first 24 months of disability will not impact Income Benefits.
<EOS>
As outlined in Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 34, rows [8-24], if an Insured Employee is eligible for Other Income Benefits such as Social Security or Workers' Compensation, they are required to apply promptly and pursue any necessary appeals (reconsideration and Administrative Law Judge hearing). Failure to do so may result in the Company suspending or reducing Monthly Benefits by an estimated amount. Employers must cooperate when filing a Workers' Compensation claim. If the Insured Employee does not pursue Other Income Benefits on time, the Company retains the option to deny or suspend benefits, or reduce them by an estimated amount.
<EOS>
Under Lincoln Policy 5293231, during a claim for Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits, the insured employee must opt for one of two options in writing. If no written election is made, monthly benefits will be reduced according to Option 1. The options are as follows:

1. The first option involves a one-time lump sum payment equal to 24 months' worth of monthly benefits payable at the time of retirement or disability. This payment serves to offset future Social Security or Government Retirement Plan payments.

2. In the second option, the insured employee will receive reduced monthly benefits if they concurrently receive Social Security or Government Retirement Plan payments. The reduction in Monthly Benefits follows a predetermined percentage based on the amount received from these external sources. If no choice is made, the default is Option 1. These decisions carry significant implications for the insured employee's benefits payout structure and should be carefully considered before making an election.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 34 and related rows, the Insured Employee may receive reduced Monthly Benefits if they are estimated to receive Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits. The Company will adjust the policy benefits based on this estimation and refund any underpayment in a lump sum upon receiving proof of the actual awarded amount or claim denial after completing any required appeals. This adjustment is contingent on the receipt of these documents, but no specific date for submission or adjudication is mentioned in this section.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, during claim processing, the Insured Employee can receive unreduced monthly benefits. However, they must agree in writing to return any overpayment arising from Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits as a lump sum. Failure to promptly repay an overpayment results in the Company reducing or eliminating future payments and disregarding the Minimum Monthly Benefit until the amount is repaid.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, lump-sum payments and other income benefits are proportionally distributed over their respective time periods. If no specific duration is mentioned, the company continues its estimated monthly deductions for that benefit until full offset. In cases where no estimated monthly offset was being made, the lump sum will be divided into equal monthly installments for a reasonable period, not exceeding 60 months or the Maximum Benefit Period, whichever comes first.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Policy 5293231, the Cost-of-Living Freeze is applicable to all Other Income Benefits (except Earnings) following the initial deduction. This freeze ensures that the Monthly Benefit will not be further reduced due to any cost-of-living increases associated with these benefits, as of January 1, 2013 (GL3001-LTD-15). The policy is outlined on pages [34, 35], in rows [62, 63, 1, 4, 5].
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, disability benefits eligibility is outlined as follows: Benefits are payable if an Insured Employee becomes Totally Disabled due to sickness or injury. Total Disability is defined as the inability to perform the essential duties of their own occupation for more than 90 days. If an Insured Employee returns to work and earns less than 80% of their pre-disability income, they may still receive partial benefits. The maximum benefit amount is 66 2/3% of the base salary at the time of disability. Benefits are payable until the end of the policy term, Normal Retirement Age, or death, whichever occurs first. The policy also includes an Option to Increase Benefit Rates, allowing the Insured Employee to increase their benefit rate up to age 62 without evidence of good health, provided they make the necessary contributions.
<EOS>
This policy, specifically in Lincoln Policy 5293231 on page 32 row 51, outlines a provision that covers unreduced retirement benefits for the Insured Employee. Notably, if the employee retires before the Normal Retirement Age (NRA) and opts for an immediate life annuity payout, the benefits are subject to an early retirement reduction factor of 6% for every year prior to NRA until age 62. After reaching age 62, this reduction stops, allowing for unreduced benefits thereafter. Additionally, if the employee retires after the NRA but before the Later Retirement Age (LRA), the benefits will be reduced by 3% annually up to the LRA. There are no reductions for retirement beyond the LRA.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf, "Government Retirement Plans" encompass disability and retirement benefits from the federal Social Security Act, Jones Act or Railroad Retirement Act, Canada Pension Plan or Quebec Pension Plan, or any similar plans of foreign countries, states, provinces, or political units. This also includes replacement plans for any of the above schemes. Specifically, this refers to Plan 2 GL3001-LTD-14-INT 10 Any Occ, Prim SS Integ. starting from 01/01/13. Here, retirement benefits actually received by the Insured Employee are taken into account during reduced retirement benefit calculations.

According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 35, rows 4, 5, and 7, a Recurrent Disability refers to one caused by an Injury or Sickness similar to or related to the condition for which Monthly Benefits were previously paid. A Recurrent Disability is subject to specific conditions:

1. If you experience a Recurrent Disability within 24 months following the end of your initial Disability, the elimination period will be waived.
2. After this initial 24-month window, if another Recurrent Disability occurs, the usual elimination period will apply before benefits commence.
3. The benefit amount remains the same as that provided during the initial Disability, with no reduction due to prior payment of Monthly Benefits for this Recurrent Disability.
4. The Recurrent Disability must be confirmed by the attending physician, who will provide necessary documentation.
5. The policy continues to cover you, subject to all other terms and conditions as outlined in Lincoln Policy 5293231.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, a recurrent disability is considered a new disability if the insured employee returns to their own occupation with the employer on a full-time basis (as per the Schedule of Benefits) for six consecutive months or more after the prior disability benefits end. A new elimination period must be completed before further monthly benefits are payable, and a new maximum benefit period applies.
<EOS>
This section from Lincoln Policy 5293231 details the Recurrent Disability provision. If an Insured Employee returns to their Own Occupation with the employer for less than six months following the end of prior Disability benefits, and works at least the Minimum Number of Hours Per Week as shown in the Schedule of Benefits, a Recurrent Disability is considered part of the prior Disability. There is no need for a new Elimination Period, and the same Maximum Benefit Period and Predisability Income apply.

If the Insured Employee does not return to work with the employer, their coverage terminates, they start working full-time for a new employer, benefits are not payable under any other group long-term disability plan, and a Recurrent Disability begins within six consecutive months after the prior Disability benefits end, benefits will be reinstated without requiring a new Elimination Period. The same Maximum Benefit Period, Exclusions, Limitations, and Predisability Income apply.

To receive Monthly Benefits, the Insured Employee or former Employee must earn less than the specified percentage of Predisability Income in the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit section. All other terms of this Policy that applied to the prior Disability will also apply to the Recurrent Disability. This provision ceases to apply if the Insured Employee becomes eligible for coverage under any other group long-term disability plan. GL3001-LTD-16 10 3/12 Pre-Ex. 35 01/01/13

Under this policy (Lincoln 5293231), vocational rehabilitation programs may be approved by the company. During such a program, the policy's disability definition is temporarily waived. After the program ends, the company determines the length and amount of Long Term Disability benefits payable. The crucial detail to note is that the waived disability definition will be reapplied post-rehabilitation.
<EOS>
Under the Lincoln Policy 5293231, disability coverage is excluded for an Insured Employee who intentionally refuses to participate in good faith during the Own Occupation Period or any occupation thereafter, without valid justification. Additionally, if a Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit has been received and the employee fails to complete the program without sufficient reason, disability benefits will not be provided. This policy provision applies to specified rows on page 40 of the document.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, "Good Cause" is defined as the Insured Employee's documented physical or mental impairments preventing Program participation, involvement in a medical program interfering with the same, or good faith participation in a vocational rehabilitation program that conflicts with a Company-developed Program while being reasonably expected to facilitate their return to work.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Policy 5293231, a 'Program' is defined as a vocational rehabilitation plan. This plan, developed with the Insured Employee, their Physician, and any suitable employer, details the Program's objectives, assigns responsibilities to each party, and outlines the rehabilitation services' timings, dates, and costs. The comprehensive program aims to help the insured employee recover from their disability, ensuring the plan's goals, duties, and expenses are clearly stated.
<EOS>
Under Lincoln Policy 5293231, an employer may receive a Reasonable Accommodation Benefit for a disabled employee receiving benefits. This benefit reimburses up to 50% of the expense for reasonable accommodations, with a maximum of $5,000 per employee or the company's expected liability for the employee's Long Term Disability claim (whichever is less). Qualifying services include, but are not limited to, providing an accessible parking space or entrance, removing barriers, supplying special equipment, offering training materials in alternative formats, and translating during training. The employer determines other necessary services to help the disabled employee return to work.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on page 41 (rows 27-38), an employer is eligible for the Benefit if they have an insured employee whose disability prevents regular occupation performance at the worksite. This employee must possess necessary physical and mental abilities, but only with proposed accommodation, and be reasonably expected to return to work with this aid. The requested Reasonable Accommodation Benefit should be less than the anticipated liability for the insured employee's Long Term Disability claim.
<EOS>
According to the written proposal outlined in Lincoln Policy 5293231, reasonable accommodation services are provided based on input from three parties: the Employer, the Insured Employee, and their Physician, when necessary. The proposal must explicitly specify the purpose of the proposed accommodation, along with the respective times, dates, and costs associated with these services.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, an accommodation proposal for the insured employee must be approved in writing by the Company. The employer will then receive reimbursement upon providing evidence that they have provided services and paid for these services on behalf of the insured employee. This reimbursement is contingent on the employer's compliance with the specified conditions outlined within the policy.
<EOS>
In Lincoln Policy 5293231, prior insurance credit is detailed. If a policyholder had another long-term disability (LTD) insurance policy in force before the effective date of this policy, they may be eligible for prior insurance credit. The credit will be applied if the new policy's elimination period is longer than the one from the prior policy and the waiting period on the previous policy has been satisfied. For instance, if an individual held GL3001-LTD-18 99 LA policy since 01/01/13, any subsequent LTD policy with a longer elimination period would receive credit for this prior coverage. The credit applies only to the portion of the disability benefit that corresponds to the time covered by the previous LTD policy.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf on pages 42, rows 3 and 4, Prior Insurance Credit is provided to prevent coverage loss due to a transfer of insurance carriers. If an employee is insured under the prior carrier's policy at its termination date, this policy will grant credit towards the new premium. The credit amount will be calculated based on the period between the end of the previous policy and the start of the new one, considering the same coverage levels and options selected by the employee. This applies only to employees with qualifying prior insurance policies.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, an employee is eligible for coverage if they were insured under the previous policy at the time of transfer and were not actively working due to injury or sickness on the new policy's effective date. The coverage provided will be equivalent to that offered by the previous policy, had it remained active. The company will pay the benefit that the previous carrier would have paid, minus any liability amount owed to the previous carrier.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf outlines the payable disability benefits due to a pre-existing condition. If an employee was insured by the prior carrier's policy at the time of transfer and was also actively-at-work and insured under this policy on its effective date, then:

   - When the company applies this policy's pre-existing condition exclusion, credit will be given for any period already served under the prior carrier's policy if the employee enrolled in this policy upon first becoming eligible and had a gap in coverage of no more than 60 days prior to their effective date.
   - If the employee cannot satisfy this policy's pre-existing condition exclusion but can meet the requirement of continuous time insured under both policies, they will be paid according to the benefit schedule with all terms, conditions, and limitations of either policy, whichever is less.
   - If the employee fails to meet either policy's pre-existing condition exclusion, no benefits will be paid.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 43, rows 4, 6, and 7, the Three Month Survivor Benefit (GL3001-LTD-19 94 LA 42) stipulates that if an insured becomes totally disabled due to sickness or injury and survives for three months, a lump sum benefit equivalent to 5 times their monthly benefit will be paid out. This benefit is only payable after the insured has received 240 months of benefits. The policy's total disability definition requires the inability to perform the material and substantial duties of any gainful occupation for which one is or becomes suited by education, training, or experience.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, in the event of an Insured Employee's death after suffering from Disability for 180 days or more and while receiving a Monthly Benefit, the Company will pay a lump sum equal to three times the Last Monthly Benefit to the Eligible Survivor. The Last Monthly Benefit refers to the gross amount payable immediately prior to death. Reductions due to Other Income Benefits or Partial Disability Employment earnings do not apply.

The Eligible Survivor can be either the surviving spouse or, if none, the under-25 children of the Insured Employee on their date of death. If payment is due to children, it will go to them equally or a designated representative. This payment holds validity against all claims made by those representing or claiming to represent the children.

In the absence of Eligible Survivors, the payment is directed towards the Insured Employee’s estate. The policy was updated on 01/01/13 (GL3001-LTD-41-FC).
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 44 and following, the insurance company will cover Family Care Expenses for an insured employee during a Partial or Total Disability. This includes instances when the employee is Terminally Ill, has Cognitive Impairment, or experiences Loss of Activities of Daily Living. The Family Care Expense Benefit is an additional payout and is not reduced by Other Income Benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, the Insured Employee must provide monthly proof of family care expenses for a Dependent. The proof must include the Dependent's name, age (with a reason stated if over the maximum age specified in the Dependent definition), dates of care, total charges and payments, provider details (name, address, telephone number, and either Federal Employer Identification Number or Taxpayer Identification Number). This documentation should be submitted on page numbers [44] rows [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39].
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, under the Family Care Expense Benefit section on row 42 of page 44, the policy will cover up to $250 per month for each eligible dependent. This benefit is only applied to expenses that are not reimbursable from other sources. The total amount is based on actual family care expenses paid by the insured. Keep in mind that this policy's terms and conditions apply; any questions should be directed to Lincoln for clarification.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Policy 5293231, the Family Care Expense Benefit will terminate upon the earliest occurrence of three conditions:

  1. The cessation of Total or Partial Disability Benefits for the Insured Employee under this policy.

  2. The point at which the Insured Employee's Dependents no longer meet the definition of a Dependent as outlined within this provision.

  3. After the Company has made 12 consecutive monthly Family Care Expense Benefit payments.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, the term 'Child' refers to the Insured Employee's biological, adopted, step-child, foster child, or any child for whom they are the legal guardian. This definition encompasses children with no age limitations. Benefits extend to these individuals under certain circumstances, such as when the child is a dependent on the employee's tax return and meets eligibility requirements set by the policy. It is essential to note that all children must be named and approved by Lincoln for coverage under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf, "Cognitive Impairment" refers to a permanent deterioration or loss of cognitive or intellectual capacity in the Insured Employee or Dependent, requiring another's active, hands-on help or verbal cues to avoid self or others harm. Diagnosis must be made by a Physician using clinical evidence and standardized tests for short/long-term memory, orientation, and abstract reasoning. This impairment may stem from moderate to severe head trauma, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, or other irreversible dementia (GL3001-LTD-41-FC 01/01/13).
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf on pages 45 rows [5-24], a "Dependent" is defined as:

1. A legal spouse who lives with the Insured Employee and is incapable of independent living due to a mental or physical condition.
2. A child under 16 years old, or an unmarried child aged 16 or older who lives with the Insured Employee, is incapable of independent living due to a mental or physical condition, and falls under the policy's scope.
3. A parent or parent-in-law who resides with the Insured Employee and requires assistance due to a mental or physical condition that hinders independent living.

All dependents must meet the specified criteria as outlined in the policy.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf on pages 45 (rows 27-31), 'Family Care Expense' refers to costs incurred for the care of a Dependent, provided by a licensed provider. Notably, this expense applies only to Dependents who are neither immediate family members nor reside in the Insured Employee's home. This coverage is significant as it helps shoulder expenses related to caregiving under specific circumstances specified within the policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 45, rows 34-39, "Incapable of Independent Living" for a Dependent refers to the following circumstances: if the Dependent is Terminally Ill, suffers from Cognitive Impairment, or experiences a Loss of Activities of Daily Living. To qualify under these conditions, it's essential that these impairments meet specific requirements as outlined in the policy. For instance, the Loss of Activities of Daily Living must involve at least two of six activities (eating, toileting, transferring, bathing, dressing, and continence) for a consecutive 90-day period. The Dependent's physician must provide written documentation confirming the qualifying condition, and the insurer will require periodic reassessments to ensure ongoing eligibility.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 45 and relevant rows 42, 43, 45, and 46, the term 'Loss of Activities of Daily Living' refers to a situation where either the Insured Employee or Dependent has lost the ability to perform at least two out of six essential daily activities without significant assistance. These daily activities include eating, toileting, transferring (from bed or chair), bathing, dressing, and continence. The inability to complete these tasks independently signals the need for another person's active help with most or all of the activity. This condition determines eligibility for certain benefits under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, bathing involves washing oneself using a tub, shower, or sponge bath, with or without equipment. This policy covers incidents related to bathing, providing coverage for unexpected injuries or illnesses that may occur during the act of bathing. The policy stipulates that these incidents must be reported within a specified timeframe to be considered valid. It's essential to adhere to all safety precautions while bathing to avoid accidents and ensure the validity of any potential claims.
<EOS>

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 5293231 on pages 45 and rows 55-57, assistance with mobility, such as canes, walkers, crutches, grab bars, or mechanical/motorized devices is covered. The policy allows for transfers in and out of beds, chairs, or wheelchairs with or without equipment. Any reimbursement provided is subject to the policy's overall annual limit and will not exceed 100% of the benefit amount. This coverage applies only if the insured requires such assistance due to an injury or sickness that occurs after the effective date of the policy and persists for at least 90 days. The policy also specifies that any device provided must be medically necessary and appropriate, as determined by a licensed healthcare professional.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf, pages 45 (row 59, 60), outlines the continent clause regarding bladder and bowel control.

This increase is subject to a maximum of $2,500 per month and is available only once during the policy term. The Total Disability benefit ends at the end of the two-year period or upon the policyholder's return to work in any occupation, whichever comes first. Furthermore, this enhancement does not apply if the policyholder's disability is due to a pre-existing condition within the first 12 months from the effective date of coverage.

According to Lincoln Policy 5293231, residents of Louisiana purchasing life, annuity, or health insurance should be aware that these insurers are members of the Louisiana Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association. The purpose of this association is to protect policyholders within limits if a member insurer becomes financially incapable of meeting its obligations. If such an event occurs, the association will distribute funds among other member companies to pay claims for affected Louisiana residents and maintain coverage in specific instances. However, it's crucial to note that this protection, while valuable, is limited. This protection does not replace consumers' responsibility for selecting financially sound and well-managed insurance companies.

This information from Lincoln Policy 5293231.pdf outlines key aspects of the Louisiana Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Law. The law offers safety-net coverage, with details on coverages, exclusions, and limits provided below. However, this summary is incomplete as it does not encompass all provisions of the law. It neither alters any individual's rights or obligations under the law nor those of the Guaranty Association. The law includes a $500,000 limit per covered policyholder for life insurance coverage and a 10% co-payment requirement on claim amounts exceeding $300,000. Moreover, accident and health insurance policies are excluded from this coverage.
