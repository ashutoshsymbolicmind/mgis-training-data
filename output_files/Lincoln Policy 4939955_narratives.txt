Once the company receives a complete proof of claim and confirms liability, benefits are paid: monthly during any period of liability, with pro rata payments given for less than a month; the daily rate equals 1/30 of the Monthly Benefit. Any remaining unpaid balance at the end of the period of liability is settled immediately after confirmation of claim and liability.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, a claim is deemed "clean" when it meets three criteria: the initial written proof of claim is complete, no parts of the claim are contested or hampered by any defect preventing prompt payment. A claim is also considered clean if the insurer fails to request additional information or resolve it within 45 days following receipt of the first written proof of claim. In case of such delay, the company is obligated to pay a clean claim within this period.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Policy 4939955, a claim may be deemed 'defective' if it lacks completeness in the initial written proof, is contested partially or wholly, or contains any other issue preventing prompt payment. To confirm liability, the company can request additional information within 45 days from receiving the first proof of claim. Any further necessary information should be provided within 45 days to settle the claim. Failure to comply with these conditions may lead to a defective claim status.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, benefits are primarily payable to the Insured Employee while alive. In the event of death, certain provisions apply: any Survivor Benefit will be distributed as outlined in relevant sections; remaining benefits will go to the Insured Employee's estate. If benefits become due for the estate, a minor, or an incompetent individual unable to provide a valid receipt, up to $2,000 may be disbursed to an entitled relative identified by the company. Payments made in good faith to such a relative release the company from further liability regarding that benefit.
<EOS>
This policy document, Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, outlines the procedure for a claim decision. If any part of a claim is denied, the insured employee receives a written notice within 15 days after resolution, detailing the denial reasoning based on this policy and internal guidelines. The notice also provides instructions for requesting a review of the decision and clarifies whether additional information is required to substantiate the claim. This initial notice should ideally be sent within 45 days from when the company first receives the proof of claim, given reasonable circumstances.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, if the company needs more time to process a claim beyond the initial 15 days, an extension is permitted, and the insured employee will receive a written delay notice by the 15th day after the first proof of claim submission. Subsequent notices will be sent every 30 days until the claim resolution. These notices will detail any additional information required to determine liability and provide an expected decision timeline. If no decision is given within 105 days of the first proof of claim, the insured employee has a right to an immediate review as if the claim was denied.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, in certain claim situations, the Company may require additional information from the Insured Employee. This data must be provided within 45 days following the Company's request. Notably, any delay caused by this information gathering process will not add to the standard claim processing time limits. It is essential to note that if this requirement is not met, it might impact your claim resolution.
<EOS>
Within 180 days of a claim denial under Lincoln Policy 4939955, the Insured Employee may submit a written request and supporting materials for review. Upon receipt, the Company will evaluate the claim and provide a written decision notice within 45 or 90 days, depending on whether special circumstances apply. The notice includes reasons for the decision under the Policy terms and internal guidelines, potential further appeal procedures, access to relevant claim information, and options to request a state insurance department review or legal action. If the denial is upheld in part or full, the notice outlines these steps.
<EOS>
Under Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, if the Company requires more than 45 days to process an appeal in a unique situation, it may extend the time by up to 45 additional days. By the 30th day after receiving the review request, the Insured Employee will receive a written notice detailing the special reasons for the delay, whether additional information is needed for the claim review, and when a decision can be anticipated.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf on pages 15, rows 40-41, the Insured Employee may be required to provide additional information for an appeal processing. This supplementary data must be supplied within 45 days following the Company's request, and any delay in providing it will not affect the above-mentioned time limits for appeal processing.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, an ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) participant or beneficiary must exhaust administrative remedies before filing a legal action under Section 502(a). The process entails seeking two administrative reviews of any adverse claim decision as outlined in this section. After completing the required reviews, an ERISA plan participant or beneficiary is permitted to commence legal proceedings under the federal labor law.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, row numbers 51-53 on page 15, the Company forgoes any right to contest a claimant's failure to exhaust administrative remedies under ERISA regulations. This waiver applies in cases where specific conditions are met, such as when the Company fails to respond within 45 days of receiving a request for benefits or provides an incomplete response. The deadline for the claimant to file suit is extended by the period from the date of the initial request to the date of the final decision regarding their claim.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, if overpayments occur on any short-term or long-term disability benefits, full reimbursement to the Company is necessary within 60 days. The Company retains the right to reduce future benefits and suspend payment of the Minimum Monthly Benefit, reduce benefits under any group insurance policy issued by them, or recover overpayments from the Insured Employee or their estate. This reimbursement applies regardless of whether the overpayment is due to processing errors, Other Income Benefits, fraud, misrepresentation, omission of relevant facts, or any other reason. Failure to make reimbursement may result in a reduction or suspension of benefits. This policy was updated on 06/01/12.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, any legal action to recover benefits must wait for 60 days following submission of the written proof of claim. The timeframe for such actions is limited to three years from the date the written proof of claim is required.

Under Lincoln Policy 4939955, the insurance company holds the authority to manage, interpret, and administer this policy, including claims resolution. They have the right to establish administrative procedures, determine eligibility, require necessary information, and resolve disputes upon internal claim reviews. Their decisions are conclusive and binding, though the insured employee may request a state insurance department review or legal action (excluding California residents). This authority encompasses resolving all questions arising under the policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.PDF on pages 17, rows 1, 4, and 5, eligibility for GL3001-LTD coverage requires an employee to have worked at least 20 hours a week for the past 16 consecutive weeks prior to the disability start date. The plan offers long term disability benefits that replace up to 60% of the monthly base earnings during the benefit period, with maximum monthly benefits capped at $7,500.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf on pages 17, rows 3-4, eligible employee classes for insurance are specified in a schedule. The company retains the right to review and terminate any or all of these covered classes if they no longer comply with the policy's terms and conditions.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, an employee becomes eligible for coverage under this policy on the later of two dates: either the date of policy issue or upon completion of the waiting period. The waiting period, however, requires the elapsed passage of specific timeframes as per the policy's guidelines before coverage takes effect. Additionally, the policy outlines certain conditions and requirements that must be met for an employee to qualify for coverage. The duration of the waiting period and the particular conditions vary based on the nature of insurance chosen, further detailed in the specified document sections.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, prior service in an Eligible Class may be applied towards the Waiting Period under specific conditions. These include:

- Rehiring a former Employee within one year after their employment ends
- An Employee returning from an approved Family or Medical Leave, either within the 12-week leave period mandated by federal law or any longer duration as required by a similar state law
- An Employee's return from Military Leave within the timeframe specified by federal USERRA law

In all cases, the Waiting Period is detailed in the Schedule of Benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, an Employee's initial coverage becomes effective at 12:01 a.m. on the earliest of the first day of the Insurance Month following their eligibility, their return to Active Work, or upon application, premium payment, or Company approval of Evidence of Insurability (if required). Increased or additional coverage also takes effect at 12:01 a.m. on the earliest of these same conditions, while decreases in coverage take effect immediately, regardless of the Employee's Active Work status.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Policy 4939955 specifies evidence of insurability is necessary under certain circumstances:

1. If an employee applies for coverage or increased coverage more than 31 days after eligibility, or enrolls after requesting to cancel, stop payroll deductions, or premium payments from the Flexible Benefits Plan account.
2. When coverage is elected following insurance termination due to cancellation requests, stopped payroll deductions, or missed premium payments.
3. If coverage lapses due to non-payment of required premiums.
4. For optional, supplemental, or voluntary coverage exceeding any Guaranteed Issue Amounts shown in the Schedule of Benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, on row 1, a Long-Term Disability (LTD) benefit is provided for an Own Occupation up to age 65 if the insured becomes disabled and cannot perform their specific job duties due to sickness or injury.

According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, an Insured Employee may switch Eligible Classes. The new coverage will take effect on the first day of the Insurance Month that follows or coincides with the date of change, excluding instances outlined in the Effective Date provision for increases or decreases.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, if an insured employee's coverage terminates due to a break in service, they can reinstate the policy upon resuming active work within specific timeframes. This process, referred to as "reinstatement," allows for re-enrollment without satisfying a new waiting period or providing additional evidence of insurability.

Reinstatement is available under various circumstances: returning from an approved family or medical leave (within the 12 weeks mandated by federal law or any longer state-law-required period), military leave, other approved leaves within six months, layoff or termination within 12 months for any reason. To reinstate coverage, the employee must apply or be re-enrolled within 31 days of returning to active work in an eligible class.

Upon reinstatement, the insurance amount may not exceed the terminated amount. The reinstated months will count towards any unmet Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion period, and a new Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion will not apply to the reinstated amount of insurance, but will apply to any increased amount. This policy applies to GL3001-LTD-10.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf outlines the conditions for terminating coverage for an insured employee. Coverage ends at midnight on the earliest of: (1) the policy or employer's termination date; (2) the date when the employee's class is no longer eligible for insurance; (3) the date the employee ceases to be a member of an eligible class; (4) the last day of the insurance month if the employee requests termination, last payment month if premium isn't paid, or end of the premium period; (5) the end of the specific insurance benefit period; (6) the employee's employment termination date, unless continuation is provided below; or (7) the date the employee enters active military duty, excluding training less than 30 days in the Reserves or National Guard. Proof of military service leads to a refund of unearned premium.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf on pages 19 (rows 31, 33), if an insured employee ceases active work, their insurance coverage terminates. However, continuation rights are available under specific conditions. The employee or their beneficiary may choose to continue the coverage by paying the premiums based on level or modified whole life premium rates. This option is available until the age of 65 or for a maximum period of five years from the date of termination, whichever comes first. Premiums are payable annually in advance and can be paid using the cash value accumulated or through other acceptable payment methods. The amount of coverage that can be continued is limited to the lesser of the original face amount or the cash value at the time of termination.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, disability coverage for an Insured Employee may be extended during the Elimination Period, provided the Company receives the necessary premiums from the Employer. Premium payments are waived from the satisfaction of the Elimination Period until the end of the benefits' payable period. Once this period ends, premium payments must resume if coverage is to continue. The coverage can be maintained during the benefits payable period without premium payment. If Total Disability prevents work, benefits will be paid for the duration specified in the policy.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Policy 4939955 detailing Family or Medical Leave indicates that if an Insured Employee takes approved leave, coverage can be continued until the earliest of: a) the end of the leave period granted by the employer; b) 12 weeks as required by federal law or any more generous duration mandated by state law; c) when the employee notifies the employer they won't return; or d) the start date of employment with another employer. Premium payments must be consistently provided by the employer during this period of continued coverage. In the event of extended leave, coverage may continue beyond disability benefits if less favorable.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.PDF, during an Insured Employee's Military Leave, coverage can be maintained for the same duration as an approved Family or Medical Leave. The employer is responsible for making required premium payments throughout the continuation period. Importantly, this policy only applies to specified military leave events under state or federal law.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, if an insured employee experiences a temporary lay-off or approved leave of absence (excluding Family or Medical Leave and Military Leave), coverage can be continued for three Insurance Months. This continuation begins upon the initiation of the lay-off or leave. To maintain this extended coverage, the required premium payments must be consistently remitted by the employer throughout the period of extended coverage. The policy was last updated on GL3001-LTD-10 04 19 06/01/12.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, under the conditions for continuation, an employer must not discriminate unfairly among employees in similar situations. Continuation of insurance may not be provided when an insured employee ceases active work due to a labor dispute, strike, work slowdown, or lockout. This policy is applicable on pages 20, rows 5 and 6.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, during a Disabled Employee's coverage, termination will not impact benefit payments for that specific period of Disability. This means that if an Insured individual is temporarily unable to work due to illness or injury, their policy coverage remains intact, and they will continue to receive benefits throughout this timeframe.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf outlines the conditions for terminating this policy. The Group Policyholder must provide at least 31 days' written notice before termination. The Company can terminate the policy if there are fewer than 10 Insured Employees, or less than 75% or 100% of eligible employees are insured, depending on the payment method. The Company may also terminate if the Policyholder fails to promptly provide necessary information, perform duties in good faith, or if the employer is no longer covered under state Workers' Compensation or similar programs. Termination is also possible if the Company ends all other long-term disability policies in the same state or if state law requires it.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, the Policyholder can terminate this policy by providing written notice in advance. The policy will then terminate either on the date the Company receives the notice or a mutually agreed-upon later date. However, termination won't take effect during any premium payment period. The Policyholder remains responsible for paying premiums up to the termination date. Premium payments made before termination are non-refundable.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf on pages 20, row numbers 50-51, if a premium is not paid before the end of the Grace Period, the policy will automatically terminate without further action from the company. The policyholder remains responsible for all premium payments up to the termination date. It's crucial to note that non-payment triggers this termination process.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf on pages 20 and 21, during a period of disability, an insured employee's participation will not impact the benefits received for that specific disability. This policy provision adheres to GL3001-LTD-11, effective from 04/20/06 and revised on 01/12/12. Benefits are payable regardless of participation during the disability period.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, coverage under this policy becomes effective only after the first premium is paid. To maintain coverage, the employer must ensure each subsequent premium is paid on or before its due date at the Company's Group Insurance Service Office. The payments should be made in U.S. dollars.
<EOS>
According to the premium rates outlined in Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf (page 21, row 9), the initial premiums for this policy are clearly stated on the document's face page. However, it is important to note that these rates may be subject to change over time.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf outlines premium rate change scenarios:

  1. The company may adjust any premium rates on various dates, including the policy's anniversary or a later-agreed rate guarantee date.

  2. Changes in federal, state, or local law affecting liability are also applicable.

  3. The company's liability changes when the policyholder relocates, dissolves, merges, or is added/removed from the policy; ceases to be covered by Workers’ Compensation or similar programs; or stops providing or reducing Sick Leave or Salary Continuance Plan benefits.

  4. Coverage for one or more classes can cease under this policy, as can changes in the number of Insured Employees by 25% or more from the policy's inception or the most recent Rate Guarantee Date expiration, if later.

  5. At least 31 days' advance written notice is required for any premium rate increase, except for specific agreements between the company and policyholder.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, the monthly premium for insurance coverage is calculated as Covered Payroll multiplied by the premium rate. Premium adjustments are made on the due date coinciding or following changes in an employee's insurance status, and these changes do not adhere to a daily pro-rated basis. For instance, if an employee's insurance begins or terminates, the corresponding premium will be charged or cease from the relevant due date. Similarly, when premium payments are made other than monthly, adjustments will take effect from the subsequent due date. These methods of charging premium are for accounting purposes only and do not extend coverage beyond its intended termination date. Each premium payment includes any necessary adjustments due to recent changes yet to be accounted for. If a premium adjustment necessitates a return of unearned premium, the maximum amount returned is limited to the prior 12-month period.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, a Grace Period of 31 days is granted for each premium payment due after the first. The Policy will continue during this Grace Period; however, the Policyholder remains accountable for paying all premiums for the duration the Policy stays active. This policy requires the Policyholder to settle outstanding premiums by the end of this grace period to avoid policy termination.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, if an insured employee becomes disabled, premium payments are waived starting from the first due date following the elimination period and lasting for the entire duration of benefit payout. Should coverage need to continue after a waiver period, premiums must be resumed upon their due dates. This policy applies to the GL3001-LTD-12 10 Any Occ, Standard Integ. plan, effective from June 1st, 2012.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf details the Total Disability Monthly Benefit for an insured employee. The benefit is payable after the Elimination Period if the employee is Totally Disabled, becomes disabled while insured, is under a physician's regular care, and provides proof of continued total disability and care upon request.

The benefit ceases on the earliest of: the employee's recovery or death; the end of the Maximum Benefit Period; or the employee's ability to engage in Partial Disability Employment, either in their own occupation during the Own Occupation Period or any occupation after this period. Proportional benefits are paid for a partial month of total disability.

The company may deny or suspend payments if the employee: fails to take a required medical exam without good cause; fails to cooperate with the examiner; postpones a required exam more than twice; does not provide additional proof within 45 days after request; or does not provide proof of application for any Other Income Benefits within 45 days after request.

Partial disability employment and benefit suspension dates are at the company's option. Additionally, proportional benefits are provided for a partial month of total disability.
<EOS>
This policy from Lincoln (4939955.pdf) specifies the Total Disability Monthly Benefit. It is calculated as a multiple of the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings with the Benefit Percentage, but capped at the Maximum Monthly Benefit. Other Income Benefits are subtracted from this amount. The benefit will not fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit unless the sum of the Minimum Monthly Benefit, Other Income Benefits exceeds 100% of the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings. The Benefit Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period are all detailed in the Schedule of Benefits.
<EOS>
This information is derived from Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf on pages 24, rows 6 and 7, detailing the ADL Benefit. The policy provides an Accelerated Death Benefit (ADB) for terminal illness or irreversible impairment, allowing early access to up to 90% of the death benefit sum. This ADB can be received in increments of $10,000 up to a maximum of $500,000 per request. To qualify, policyholders must have less than 24 months (60 months for certain terminal illnesses) left to live as determined by attending physicians. This ADB is available only once during the coverage period and is considered a loan that reduces the death benefit amount.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, an Insured Employee will receive coverage for Long Term Disability Benefits under the Progressive Income Benefit as follows: The effective date of coverage is determined upon either the commencement of the insured's disability or the policy's effective date, whichever occurs later. If this provision is added to the policy at a later time through amendment, the effective date of that addition will also be specified. The duration of benefits extends to age 65 or until the Insured Employee returns to work, whichever comes first. The percentage of the covered income replaced for the first two years of disability is 60%, which increases to 70% thereafter.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, an Insured Employee's effective date for this benefit will be delayed if they cannot perform the Activities of Daily Living or suffer from a Cognitive Impairment on that date. The employee will become insured when they can safely and independently perform all Activities of Daily Living without assistance or their Cognitive Impairment resolves.
<EOS>
Per Lincoln Policy 4939955, upon completing the Elimination Period as indicated in the Schedule of Insurance, the company will pay an additional monthly benefit to an Insured Employee who is concurrently receiving either Total Disability or Partial Disability Monthly Benefits under this policy. This extra payment is applicable if the employee can provide proof of either Loss of Activities of Daily Living or Cognitive Impairment (as defined). The proof must be submitted at the employee's own expense.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf on pages 23 (rows 28-35) outlines the Progressive Income Benefit. The benefit equals 10% of the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings, but it does not surpass the Maximum Monthly Benefit for Long Term Disability Benefits or $5,000 per month (whichever is lower). The Schedule of Insurance reveals the Maximum Monthly Benefit for Long Term Disability Benefits. Notably, this benefit remains unaffected by any Other Income Benefits or earnings from any form of employment.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, the Progressive Income Benefit terminates upon the earliest occurrence of:

1. The Insured Employee's recovery from Loss of Activities of Daily Living or Cognitive Impairment (as defined).
2. The cessation of Total Disability or Partial Disability Monthly Benefits under this Policy for the Insured Employee.
3. The expiration of the Maximum Benefit Period, or
4. The death of the Insured Employee.

In case this policy includes a Family Income Benefit, the Eligible Surviving Spouse or Children will not receive increased payments due to the Insured Employee's receipt of the Progressive Income Benefit.
<EOS>
According to the 'Loss of Activities of Daily Living' section in Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, an Insured Employee is considered disabled if, due to an injury or sickness, they cannot safely and independently perform at least two out of six essential daily living activities without substantial assistance from another person. The activities include personal hygiene, continence, transferring (e.g., moving in and out of bed), dressing, eating, and maintaining safe surroundings. If the Insured Employee requires hands-on help for most of these activities, they are considered to have lost these abilities. This section defines disability under the policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, bathing involves cleaning oneself in a tub, shower, or through sponge baths with or without equipment on row 60, page 23.

This coverage is subject to the policy terms and limits specified in your policy contract.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.PDF on pages 23 (rows 62 and 63), the coverage extends to braces or artificial limbs that are usually worn.

The policy does not differentiate between various types of braces or limbs but rather focuses on those routinely used by the insured individual.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf on page 23, row 65, the policy covers assistance related to toileting, including getting on and off the toilet, as well as performing associated personal hygiene tasks. The policy provides coverage for these services up to a maximum percentage based on the individual's level of disability. For example, if an individual requires extensive or constant supervision due to their condition, they may receive 100% reimbursement for related costs. However, if an individual only needs occasional assistance, they may receive a lower percentage of reimbursement. This coverage is subject to the policy's overall limits and duration.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, page 23 rows 67-69, the policy covers mobility assistance during transitions in and out of beds, chairs, or wheelchairs. This may involve using devices such as canes, walkers, crutches, grab bars, and other support equipment, or mechanical/motorized aids. The coverage applies to both short-term and long-term use of these items for individuals requiring assistance due to injury, illness, or disability. Additionally, the policy specifies that any medical devices or adaptations required for safe mobility will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf at pages 23 and rows 71-72, continence refers to the ability to control bladder and bowel functions voluntarily.

In accordance with Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, a 'Pre-Existing Condition' refers to any illness or injury for which the insured received treatment within 12 months prior to their policy effective date. This treatment can encompass physician consultations, care and services, diagnostic measures, and the prescription, refill, or consumption of prescribed drugs or medicines. Any such conditions are not covered under this policy unless they meet specified exception criteria.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Policy 4939955 on pages 24, rows 40, this policy does not provide coverage during a period of disability that commences before the insured's effective date of coverage under this benefit. This means if an individual becomes disabled prior to the activation of their insurance, they will not receive benefits from this policy. The critical date for determining eligibility is the effective date of coverage specified in the policy.
<EOS>
According to the specified section of Lincoln Policy 4939955, benefits for Loss of Activities of Daily Living or Cognitive impairment are not payable if the impairment is caused, contributed to, or results from a Pre-Existing Condition within the first 24 months following the Insured Employee's effective date.

The benefit ceases when the Insured Employee is no longer partially disabled or dies, the Maximum Benefit Period ends, or they earn more than 99% of Predisability Income after 24 months, or 85% after the same period. The employee can choose not to work full-time in their own occupation during the Own Occupation Period or any occupation post-Own Occupation Period.

Proportional benefits are paid for partial months of disability, and payments may be denied or suspended for various reasons such as failing a required medical exam without good cause, failing to cooperate with the examiner, postponing an exam more than twice, not providing additional proof within 45 days, or not providing proof of application for Other Income Benefits within 45 days.

Under the Progressive Calculation section of Lincoln Policy 4939955, specific to Classes 1 and 2 (GL3001-LTD-13.4), the policy outlines certain terms for long-term disability benefits. If a claimant becomes disabled due to sickness or injury, they may receive 60% of their monthly base salary up to $6,000 per month. This benefit is subject to review every three years. The benefit period lasts until the claimant reaches age 65 or returns to work. Additionally, the policy features a 24-month maximum duration for the Ordinary Disability definition and a 72-month maximum for the Specialty Occupation Disability definition.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf at pages 26, rows 5, 6, 8, and 10, the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit compensates for lost income during partial disability. This benefit is capped at the Total Disability Monthly Benefit, which would otherwise be paid in full for total disability without employment. Therefore, the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit equates to the lesser of either A or B: A being a specified percentage of the Insured Employee's pre-disability earnings or B being the amount equal to the Total Disability Monthly Benefit minus any other disability benefits currently received. These payments continue until the end of the benefit period, which is typically two years from the date of disability onset.
<EOS>
This policy from Lincoln (4939955) on page 26, rows 12 and 14, specifies that the calculation of Lost Income benefits involves deducting all other income, including benefits derived from Partial Disability Employment. These benefits are subject to a maximum percentage, typically 80%, of the pre-disability income. The policy also outlines that such benefits may not exceed a specific period, usually two years following the onset of disability. Additionally, it's important to note that this policy applies only to the Insured Employee as detailed in the document.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf outlines the calculation of the Total Disability Monthly Benefit. The Insured Employee's Predisability Income is multiplied by the Benefit Percentage (limited to the Maximum Monthly Benefit), except for earnings from Partial Disability Employment. Other Income Benefits, excluding those from such employment, are subtracted. The Partial Disability Monthly Benefit ensures it's never less than the Minimum Monthly Benefit. All relevant figures - Benefit Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period - can be found in the Schedule of Benefits (GL3001-LTD-14-INT 10 Any Occ, Prim & Fam SS Integ. 26 06/01/12). The Benefit Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period are subject to change based on the policy's provisions.
<EOS>
According to the specified sections of Lincoln Policy 4939955 on pages 27 rows 4, 5, and 6, any additional income an insured employee receives will impact their monthly benefit. This includes benefits, awards, settlements, or earnings derived from specific sources, excluding Retirement Benefits and regular Earnings. However, such income must stem from the same disability for which a monthly benefit is claimable under this policy. In calculating the monthly benefit, the additional income will be offset.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf on pages 27 (rows 9-21) outlines the Workers' Compensation coverage. It applies to injury or sickness caused by job-related activities, encompassing laws like Workers' Compensation, occupational disease law, Jones Act, Longshoreman's and Harbor Worker's Act, Maritime Doctrine of Maintenance, Wages or Cure, or any alternative plans. Benefits include those for partial or total disability (temporary or permanent) as well as vocational rehabilitation.
<EOS>
This document, Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, outlines various compulsory benefits the Insured Employee may be entitled to under relevant state laws. These benefits encompass temporary disability income, mandated by certain state regulations, no-fault auto insurance laws, and any other compulsory benefit acts or legislation. The employee's eligibility for these benefits may impact the disability income benefits stipulated in the policy. For instance, under state temporary disability income benefit laws, an employee might be entitled to partial wage replacement should they become temporarily unable to work due to illness or injury. Similarly, no-fault auto insurance laws, when applicable, would provide benefits in case of accident-related injuries, regardless of fault. It is essential to understand and comply with these requirements as they may affect the total disability income benefits the employee receives under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, any other group insurance plans (excluding credit or mortgage insurance) or no-fault auto plans that the Insured Employee may be eligible for will affect their disability income benefits. These other plans are not included in the policy coverage. The exact impact of these external plans on the benefits will depend on their terms and conditions. It is crucial to understand these plans' specific provisions to determine any potential overlap or conflict with this policy. Please refer to the mentioned page numbers [27] and rows [33, 34, 35, 36] for further details.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, under Employee Benefit Plans (page 27, rows 39-40), the disability income benefits for the Insured Employee are not inclusive of sick leave or salary continuance plans. This exclusion applies to vacation pay, severance pay, and compensation for work performed during a Disability. These policies operate independently.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, if an insured employee receives Disability Benefits or Retirement Benefits under their Employer's Retirement Plan, these benefits will be offset by any other Disability or Retirement income the employee receives from the insurance policy. This offset applies to any Disability or Retirement income received on or after the effective date of the insurance policy and before the insured employee reaches age 65. The percentage of offset varies depending on the type of benefit and the time period involved, with details provided in the policy schedule. Additionally, if an insured employee dies before receiving their Disability Benefits or Retirement Benefits under their Employer's Retirement Plan, any surviving beneficiary may be entitled to receive these benefits, subject to the terms of the policy and the Employer's Retirement Plan.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.PDF on pages 27 and rows 46-47, Social Security and other Government Retirement Plans benefits will be offset in the event of an accidental death or dismemberment claim. The percentage of offset varies depending on the nature of the plan: if the deceased was receiving benefits before their death, the policy pays the lesser amount of either the benefit amount payable at the time of death under the government plan or 75% of the policy's face amount; if the deceased was not yet receiving benefits but was eligible, the policy will pay up to the amount the deceased would have received in benefits during their lifetime, which is calculated based on age, earnings, and other factors at the time of death. The offset does not apply if the surviving spouse or children are already receiving benefits under the government plan. This policy is subject to any applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations regarding Social Security or other Government Retirement Plans.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, if an insured employee becomes disabled, certain child benefits become eligible. The coverage extends to the employee's biological, adopted, or stepchildren under the age of 26. This benefit is contingent on the child being unmarried and financially dependent on the disabled parent. The policy provides a monthly payment equal to 15% of the disability income amount, subject to a maximum limit. The policy duration for this child benefit matches the insured employee's disability period or until the child turns 26, whichever is later.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, under unreduced retirement benefits, a spouse or child may be eligible if the Insured Employee is eligible themselves. This eligibility extends beyond the employee's lifetime, with survivor benefits available after their demise. The policy specifies that the retirement benefits for the eligible recipient are typically 60% of the Insured Employee's monthly retirement income at the time of their death. However, this percentage can be higher or lower depending on certain factors such as the age difference between the employee and the beneficiary. The eligibility requirements stipulate that the spouse must not be currently receiving a retirement benefit based on their own employment, while the child must be under 26 years old or financially dependent due to a disability. The start date for these benefits is determined by the age at which the Insured Employee retires and the terms of the policy.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Policy 4939955 outlines a clause concerning reduced retirement benefits for the Insured Employee and their spouse. These benefits stem from Government Retirement Plans such as the federal Social Security Act, Jones Act or Railroad Retirement Act, the Canada Pension Plan or Quebec Pension Plan, and any similar plans worldwide. By June 1, 2012, this policy has been integrated with Any Occ, Prim & Fam SS Integ.

The Government Retirement Plans include disability and retirement benefits from federal, state, provincial, or other political units of various countries. The reduction in these benefits is taken into account if the Insured Employee receives reduced benefits. This reduction can affect the total amount payable under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, the term "Earnings" encompasses any income an Insured Employee earns or receives from any occupation, as reported for federal income tax purposes. This includes a salaried or hourly employee's gross earnings (shown on Form W-2), comprising wages, tips, commissions, bonuses, overtime pay, and pre-tax contributions to Section 125 Plans, flexible spending accounts, or qualified deferred compensation plans. For proprietors, net profit is calculated from Form 1040, Schedule C. Similarly, professional corporation shareholders' net profit is also determined by Form 1040, Schedule C. Partners report their net earnings from self-employment on Schedule K-1, along with any W-2 earnings. Lastly, Subchapter S Corporation shareholders' net earnings from trade or business activities are shown on Schedule K-1.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf outlines exceptions to the Other Income Benefits, not included in offset calculations on pages [28, 29]. These exclusions encompass:

1. Cost-of-living increases in certain Other Income Benefits (excluding Earnings), effective only after the initial offset during a Disability period.
2. Reimbursement for hospital, medical, or surgical expenses, attorney fees, and other costs related to claiming Other Income Benefits.
3. Group credit or mortgage disability insurance benefits, early retirement benefits not under federal Social Security Act or Government Retirement Plan, contributions or termination benefits from the Employer’s Retirement Plan, and benefits from 401(k), profit-sharing, thrift plans, IRAs, TSAs, stock ownership plans, or non-qualified deferred compensation plans.
4. Vacation pay, holiday pay, severance pay, and disability income benefits under individual policies, association group plans, franchise plans, auto liability insurance (excluding no fault), except for auto insurance.

These exclusions are effective as of June 01, 2012 (GL3001-LTD-14-INT 10 Any Occ, Prim & Fam SS Integ.).
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, page 29, row 5, any Income Benefits that impact Policy benefits are subject to specific rules. If the Insured Employee receives Other Income after becoming disabled and during the receipt of Policy benefits, these Other Income amounts will be offset against the Policy benefits. This offset may reach up to 100%, depending on the type of Other Income received. The policy considers various forms of Other Income, such as disability benefits from other policies or government programs like Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). The policy will continue to pay the Policy benefits minus the offset amount, ensuring the total income does not exceed 85% of the Insured Employee's pre-disability earnings.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, an Insured Employee entitled to Other Income Benefits (e.g., Social Security) must timely apply, seek reconsideration upon denial, and request a hearing if denied again; the Employer is also obliged to cooperate in filing Workers' Compensation or similar claims. Failure to pursue these benefits promptly allows the Company to either deny/suspend Monthly Benefits or reduce them by an estimated amount.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, if a claim for Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits is pending, the Insured Employee must choose one of two options in writing:

1) Option 1 (no written election made): Monthly Benefits will be reduced according to this option.
2) The employee can elect to reduce their Monthly Benefit by a specified percentage, allowing for an increased Social Security or Government Retirement Plan benefit later.

If no written election is made, the reduction as per Option 1 will apply. Please note that technical terms such as "Insured Employee," "Monthly Benefits," and "Social Security" are integral to this policy section.
<EOS>
This information derives from the Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf (pages 29, rows 32-40). The Insured Employee may receive reduced Monthly Benefits due to anticipated Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits. The Company will make necessary adjustments to policy benefits and refund any underpayment in a lump sum upon receiving proof of the awarded amount or claim denial, along with completion of any required appeals.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, during claim processing, the Insured Employee may receive unreduced monthly benefits. However, they must agree in writing to refund any overpayment that results from receiving Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits in a lump sum. Failure to promptly repay an overpayment will lead to the Company reducing or eliminating future payments and suspending the Minimum Monthly Benefit application until the amount is repaid.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, lump sum payments of other income benefits are proportioned over the specified timeframe. If no duration is provided, the company will apply an estimated monthly deduction until full offset, basing this on their estimate. In cases where no prior monthly offset was in effect, the lump sum is divided over a reasonable period not exceeding 60 months or the Maximum Benefit Period, whichever comes first. This proportioning process ensures that the policyholder receives consistent portions of their benefits throughout the applicable timeframe.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, section on Cost-of-Living Freeze (located on pages 29 and 30, rows 62, 63, 1, 4, and 5), the amount for each Other Income Benefit, excluding Earnings, will be frozen upon first deduction. Any cost-of-living increases under these other benefits will not impact the Monthly Benefit further (GL3001-LTD-15 04 29 06/01/12). This policy provision aims to maintain the frozen amount, shielding it from any potential rise in living costs as defined by the other income benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf on pages 30, rows 4, 5, and 7, a Recurrent Disability refers to a condition that is the same as or related to a prior Disability for which Monthly Benefits were already paid. In such cases, benefits will be reinstated if the recurrence lasts more than 30 days. If the policyholder returns to work and then experiences a recurrence within 90 days, they may still receive partial benefits based on their earnings during this period. The benefit amount for a Recurrent Disability is calculated using the same method as the initial Disability. Additionally, the elimination period for a Recurrent Disability will be waived if it was served during the prior Disability, provided the new disability starts within 90 days of the termination of the prior benefit period. The policy also specifies that if a policyholder receives benefits for both a current and a Recurrent Disability simultaneously, their total monthly payment will not exceed the maximum stated in the policy.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, a Recurrent Disability is treated as a new Disability under specific conditions. To qualify for further Monthly Benefits following the end of prior Disability benefits, the Insured Employee must return to their Own Occupation on a full-time basis, working at least the Minimum Number of Hours Per Week specified in the Schedule of Benefits, and maintain this status for six consecutive months. A new Elimination Period is required before further payments are made. Additionally, a new Maximum Benefit Period applies.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Policy 4939955 detail states that a Recurrent Disability, following an initial disability, can be treated as part of the prior Disability if it occurs within six consecutive months of the prior Disability benefits ending. The Recurrent Disability does not require a new Elimination Period for benefit payments and shares the same Maximum Benefit Period and Exclusions/Limitations as the prior Disability. The Predisability Income used in determining the prior Disability benefit will also apply to the Recurrent Disability.

If the insured employee returns to their own occupation with the employer for less than six months following the end of prior Disability benefits, and certain subsequent events occur within that period (e.g., job unavailability, policy termination, new employment, no benefits under other plans), the Recurrent Disability will be treated as a prior Disability, and benefits will be reinstated without requiring a new Elimination Period. The same Maximum Benefit Period, Exclusions/Limitations, and Predisability Income will apply to the Recurrent Disability as to the prior Disability.

To qualify for Monthly Benefits during a Recurrent Disability, the insured employee or former employee must earn less than the specified percentage of Predisability Income in the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit section, and payments will be subject to all other terms of this Policy that applied to the prior Disability. This provision ceases to apply if the insured employee becomes eligible for coverage under another group long-term disability plan.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Policy 4939955 specifically excludes total or partial disability benefits under the following conditions:

1. As a result of war, whether declared or undeclared, or any act of war.
2. Due to intentionally self-inflicted injuries or active participation in a riot.
3. When the insured employee is engaged in committing or attempting a felony, assault, battery, or during incarceration for a felony.
4. If the insured employee is not under regular medical care by a physician.
5. After residing outside the United States or Canada for more than 12 consecutive benefit months, except for employment with the employer.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, any total or partial disability that is either caused or worsened by a pre-existing condition within the first 24 months after the insured employee's effective date will not be covered. A pre-existing condition is defined as one for which treatment was sought within 12 months prior to the effective date, and this includes consultations, care, services provided by a physician, diagnostic measures, or the prescription, refill of prescription, or taking of any prescribed drugs or medicines. The insured employee will only be exempt from this exclusion if they did not receive treatment for that condition during the six months following their effective date. This policy applies to GL3001-LTD-17 98 Specified Limit.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, under the section on Disability benefits (rows 4-11, page 32), Monthly Partial or Total Disability Benefits are payable, subject to policy terms. However, these benefits are only available for a maximum of 24 months per disability period unless the insured employee is hospitalized. The defined "Specified Injuries or Sicknesses" include mental illnesses and substance abuse. It's important to note that mental sicknesses and substance abuse are also defined within this policy. These benefits might be limited to 24 months for any one disability period unless the insured employee is hospitalized, effectively extending the duration of these benefits beyond the initial 24-month limit.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, if the Insured Employee is hospitalized at the end of the 24th month following payment for a Specified Injury or Sickness, benefits will continue until their discharge from that facility. However, these monthly benefits will not be payable beyond the Maximum Benefit Period shown in the Schedule of Insurance. It's crucial to note that this period may end before the employee's hospitalization does.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf specifies that a Hospital is defined as a state-licensed, Joint Commission-approved, or certified facility offering inpatient treatment with round-the-clock registered nursing, lab, x-ray facilities, and major surgery capability. It also includes convalescent or nursing care facilities recognized under Medicare, mental hospitals treating mental sicknesses, and substance abuse treatment centers. These Hospital types must adhere to the criteria stated within the policy's relevant page range [32] rows [25-41].
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, a mental hospital is defined as a state-licensed, certified, or approved healthcare facility (or its psychiatric unit) that provides inpatient treatment for mental diseases or disorders. At all times, this type of facility must have a resident psychiatrist available, either on duty or on call. This definition can be found on pages [32] rows [44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49].
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf (page numbers [32], rows [52-68]) defines "Mental Sickness" as any emotional or behavioral abnormality, disorder, disturbance, dysfunction, or syndrome, regardless of cause, including but not limited to schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, bipolar affective disorder, manic depression, psychosis, obsessive-compulsive, depressive, panic, and anxiety disorders. Such conditions are usually treated by mental health care providers like psychiatrists or clinical psychologists through methods such as psychotherapy or psychotropic drugs. Mental Sickness excludes irreversible dementia resulting from stroke, trauma, viral infection, Alzheimer's disease, or other conditions not typically treated with psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or similar methods by mental health care providers.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, a Treatment Center is defined as a state-licensed, certified, or approved health care facility (or its medical/psychiatric unit) that offers inpatient treatment for substance abuse and operates under a Physician-approved and supervised written plan. This definition is found on pages 32 and 33, rows 73 to 78, 3, 4, 6, and 7, from the policy dated 06/01/12 (GL3001-LTD-17.3 98 Voluntary Rehab.).
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955 on pages 33 rows 4-12, a Disabled Insured Employee receiving benefits may be eligible for Vocational Rehabilitation. This benefit includes vocational evaluation, counseling, training, job placement, job modification or special equipment, and other necessary services to aid the employee's return to work. The Company decides eligibility and the payable amount of this benefit.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, an eligible employee for this benefit must have a disability that prevents regular occupation performance and lack skills for any other gainful occupation post the Own Occupation Period. The individual should possess the necessary physical and mental abilities to complete a Program. Upon completion of the Program, they are reasonably anticipated to return to work considering their motivation level and demand for workers in the proposed occupation. The labor force's expected claim liability must be less than the cost of the proposed services. This eligibility is subject to the employee meeting all these criteria.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf (pages 33, rows 27-29), the Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit's payment does not exceed the company's expected amount. This benefit is not payable for services already covered under the Insured Employee's health care plan or any other vocational rehabilitation program. The company has the option to make payments directly to the service provider if needed. Note that this benefit will not cover services already paid or payable by another source.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Policy 4939955, during a vocational rehabilitation program approved by the company, the policy's definition of Disability is temporarily waived. This waiver pertains only to the rehabilitation period. Upon the termination of the program, the company will reassess the Insured Employee's Disability status and determine any Long Term Disability benefits payable, including their amount and duration.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, the Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit will not be covered for an Insured Employee if they fail to complete the Program without Good Cause. This means that if an employee does not fulfill the requirements of the program or has a legitimate reason for failing, coverage may still apply. The details regarding what constitutes 'Good Cause' are not explicitly provided in this policy excerpt. It is essential to understand that failure to complete the Vocational Rehabilitation Program without Good Cause may affect the employee's benefits as outlined in the policy.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Policy 4939955 defines "Good Cause" for an insured employee as documented physical or mental impairments preventing program participation, involvement in a medical program interfering with a program, or participation in another vocational rehabilitation program that conflicts with the company's program but is expected to facilitate return to work. Such circumstances must be proven through documentation and should not hinder the employee from completing the initially developed program by the Company.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf on pages 33 and 34, the term 'Program' refers to a vocational rehabilitation plan, jointly developed by the Company, the Insured Employee, their Physician, and any suitable employer. This program outlines its goals, specifies each party's responsibilities, details the timelines, dates, and costs of the rehabilitation services. The plan is tailored with input from all involved parties to facilitate recovery and return to work.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, if an employee becomes disabled and receives benefits under this policy, the employer may be eligible for a Reasonable Accommodation Benefit. This benefit reimburses employers for up to 50% of the costs associated with providing reasonable accommodation services for the disabled employee, but not exceeding $5,000 per employee or the company's expected liability for the employee's Long Term Disability claim (whichever is less). Eligible services include making the worksite more accessible, removing barriers, providing special equipment or training materials, and offering translation services. The company may also deem other services necessary to help the disabled employee return to work.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, an employer is eligible for the Benefit if they have an insured employee whose disability prevents them from performing their regular occupation at the worksite. This employee must also possess the necessary physical and mental abilities to carry out their own or another occupation at the worksite but requires proposed accommodation. The employee must be reasonably expected to return to work with the proposed accommodation. Additionally, the requested Reasonable Accommodation Benefit should be less than the anticipated liability for the insured employee's Long Term Disability claim.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, the written proposal for reasonable accommodation services must be a collaborative effort between the Employer, Insured Employee, and their Physician, when necessary. The proposal should clearly outline the purpose of the proposed accommodation, along with specific details such as the times, dates, and costs associated with these services. This information is crucial in ensuring the successful implementation of the requested accommodations.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955, any accommodation proposal for the insured employee must be approved in writing by the Company. Once approved, the employer is responsible for providing and paying for the services, with subsequent reimbursement from the Company upon presentation of proof. The employer's compliance with this requirement is crucial for the Company to cover these costs. This process applies when proposals for accommodations are made by either the company, the employee, or their physician.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, dated June 1st, 2012 (GL3001-LTD-18), the Prior Insurance Credit section mandates that any previous disability insurance policy held by the insured must be presented for credit against the new policy premium. The insured has up to 90 days from the issue date of this policy to submit proof of prior coverage. The amount credited is calculated based on the ratio of the premiums paid under the old and new policies, with a maximum credit of 12 months' worth of premiums for any one policy term. This credit does not apply if there was a lapse in coverage for more than 30 days during the prior policy period or if the prior policy excluded own occupation or residual disability benefits. The credited amount will be reflected on the monthly statements and will be applied as a deduction from the premium due for the new policy.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Policy 4939955, specifically on pages 35 row 3 and 4, outlines the provision of Prior Insurance Credit to prevent coverage loss for employees due to a change in insurance carriers. Upon termination of the prior carrier's policy, credit will be given based on the employee's coverage under the previous policy. The credit will be applied to the new policy according to the coverage period and premiums paid for the old policy. The amount of credit may vary depending on factors such as the type of insurance, the effective dates of both policies, and the policy terms. It is essential to note that this credit aims to ensure continuity of coverage for employees during a carrier transfer.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, an employee is eligible for coverage if they were insured by a prior carrier's policy at the time of transfer and were not actively-at-work due to injury or sickness on the policy's effective date. The coverage provided will match that of the prior carrier's policy had it remained in force. The company will pay the benefit the prior carrier would have paid, minus any amounts for which the prior carrier is liable. This covers the period from the prior policy's termination to the earlier of the employee's return to active work or the policy's expiration.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf outlines disability benefits related to pre-existing conditions. If an employee was insured by the prior carrier's policy at transfer and is actively-at-work on the policy's effective date, benefits may be payable. The Company applies the Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion. However, if the Insured Employee cannot meet this Policy's Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion but can satisfy the prior carrier's pre-existing condition exclusion based on continuous coverage under both policies, benefits will be paid according to either this Policy without applying its Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion or the prior carrier's policy, whichever is less. If the Insured Employee cannot meet either policy's Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion, no benefits will be awarded.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Policy 4939955, specifically sections on row numbers 4, 7, and 8 of page 36, outlines the Three Month Survivor Benefit. Upon the death of the policyholder within three months of total disability, a payment equal to 94% of the monthly LTD benefit will be made for three consecutive months. This benefit is available only if the policyholder has been receiving Long-Term Disability benefits for at least six months prior to their death and if the disability began before age 65.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf on pages 36 and 37 outlines the Family Income Benefit. If an Insured Employee dies after being disabled for 180 or more days while receiving a Monthly Benefit, the company will pay a lump sum equal to three times their last monthly benefit. This "last monthly benefit" refers to the gross amount payable prior to death, with any reductions for Other Income Benefits or earnings from Partial Disability Employment excluded.

   The Eligible Survivor can be either the deceased's surviving spouse or, in their absence, their under-25 children on the date of death. If multiple children are eligible, payments will be distributed equally among them; otherwise, the company may appoint a representative to make payments on their behalf. This payment is valid and effective against all claims by others representing the children.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, the insurer will compensate an employee's family care expenses under specified conditions: when the employee is receiving either a Partial or Total Disability Benefit, and if they are terminally ill, suffering from cognitive impairment, or experiencing loss of activities of daily living. This Family Care Expense Benefit supplements all other policy benefits, without deductions for Other Income Benefits. These family care expenses are covered regardless of the disability status: partial or total. It is important to note that this benefit applies only when these specific conditions are met.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, the Insured Employee must regularly provide proof of Family Care Expenses incurred for a Dependent on a monthly basis. Acceptable evidence includes a signed receipt from the care provider, detailing: the Dependent's name and age; if the Dependent exceeds the defined "Dependent" age limit, the reason for care; dates, total charges, and payments for care; and the provider's name, address, telephone number, and either their Federal Employer Identification Number or Taxpayer Identification Number. If a Dependent's age surpasses the maximum specified as "Dependent," the explanation for care is necessary.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Policy 4939955.pdf, on page 37 row 40, the Family Care Expense Benefit covers un-reimbursed expenses up to $250 per month for each eligible dependent. These expenses must not be reimbursable from other sources. This benefit is applicable only when the insured is employing an eligible dependent as a family care provider for the insured or a covered family member.
