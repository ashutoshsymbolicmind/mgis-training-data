This insurance policy issued by Lincoln on January 1, 2021 (Page 1) supersedes any previous certificates from the same date. The coverage is contingent upon eligibility and the terms of the policy (Pages 1, 4). An employee's initial coverage becomes effective at 12:01 a.m. on the latest of four possible dates: the first Insurance Month following eligibility, resumption of Active Work, written application for coverage, or the change date if altering the policy (Pages 3, 5). Any changes in coverage take effect from the first Insurance Month following the change or the effective date of coverage under the Policy, whichever is later (Page 14).

Coverage applies to disabilities commencing on or after this effective date for employees who were Actively-At-Work and insured under the Policy on the Effective Date. For those not Actively-At-Work due to Injury or Sickness on the Effective Date, coverage is as provided by the prior carrier's policy, had it remained in force (Pages 25-27). The Certificate remains the same in all other respects. Importantly, this amendment applies only to disabilities starting from January 1, 2021, or the Insured Employee's effective date of coverage under the Policy. Additionally, it does not cover prescription refills, prescriptions, or taking prescribed drugs or medicines (Page 36).

This information from Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf details a long-term disability insurance policy for full-time employees working at least 30 hours per week. The policy provides coverage up to 60% of the employee's basic monthly earnings, with the maximum monthly benefit not exceeding this percentage times the basic monthly earnings. A 180-day elimination period applies before benefits kick in, and the duration of payments depends on the employee's age at disability. For instance, an employee under 60 receives benefits for 60 months, while one aged 65 gets 24 months. The coverage period is referred to as the 'Own Occupation Period,' which may not exceed the amount shown in the employer's financial records or the maximum covered monthly earnings permitted by the policy.

The benefit percentage, maximum and minimum monthly benefits, elimination period, maximum benefit period, own occupation period, and waiting period are all stated in the Schedule of Benefits included in the provided certificate. There is no requirement for employees to contribute to the cost of this long-term disability coverage, which lasts until the insured employee's Social Security Normal Retirement Age or the policy's maximum benefit period (whichever is later), for conditions including sickness, injury, and pre-existing conditions. The policy also outlines a partial disability monthly benefit calculation, minimum monthly benefit, and other income benefits. If any documents are lost, they can be obtained from the Plan Administrator at no charge.

This Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf document outlines an insurance policy with a maximum monthly benefit that does not surpass the benefit percentage multiplied by the insured employee's basic monthly earnings. The elimination period is 180 days of disability caused by the same or related sickness or injury, accumulated within a 360-day period. The maximum benefit period varies based on the insured employee's age at disability, ranging from 12 to 24 months for ages under 65, and 18 months for those aged 67 and above. This period is known as the own occupation period.

Annual salary refers to the insured employee's basic monthly earnings or predisability income multiplied by 12. Basic monthly earnings or predisability income is 1/12th of the insured employee's annual gross earnings from the employer during the tax year just prior to the determination date, with the amount not exceeding the maximum covered monthly earnings permitted by the policy.

The total disability monthly benefit equals the insured employee's basic monthly earnings multiplied by the benefit percentage (limited to the maximum monthly benefit), minus other income benefits. The minimum monthly benefit ensures that the benefit is not less than this threshold, unless the sum of the minimum monthly benefit plus other income benefits would exceed 100% of the insured employee's basic monthly earnings.

The progressive income benefit will not be reduced by any other income benefits or earnings from any form of employment, and its value will equal at least 10% of the insured employee's basic monthly earnings but will not surpass the maximum monthly benefit for long-term disability benefits or $5,000 per month (whichever is less). This maximum monthly benefit for long-term disability benefits is shown in the schedule of insurance.

The provided Lincoln Certificate of Group Insurance outlines the benefits, Pre-existing Condition Limitations, Exclusions, and Prior Carrier Credit are detailed. Here's a summary of crucial points regarding Disability coverage:

1. After completing the Elimination Period shown in the Schedule of Insurance, an Insured Employee will receive additional monthly benefits if:
   - They are receiving Total or Partial Disability Monthly Benefits under the Policy.
   - Submit proof of suffering Loss of Activities of Daily Living or a Cognitive Impairment (as defined). This proof is at their own expense.

2. Total Disability, or Totally Disabled, means an Insured Employee is unable to perform one or more Main Duties of his or her Specialty in the Practice of Medicine on a full-time basis as a result of Injury or Sickness. The specialty in practice immediately prior to the disability start date is considered for this purpose.

3. If an Insured Employee becomes eligible for coverage under any other group long-term disability plan, this Recurrent Disability provision will no longer apply.

4. The Elimination Period may be satisfied by days of Total Disability, Partial Disability or any combination of these. An Insured Employee does not have to be Totally Disabled prior to receiving Partial Disability Monthly Benefits.

5. A new Maximum Benefit Period will apply for a Recurrent Disability; the Predisability Income used in determining the prior Disability benefit will still apply.

6. If coverage is continued following a period for which premiums were waived, premium payments must resume upon Elimination Period completion and any other requirements listed in the Certificate of Group Insurance.

1. This policy provides long-term disability benefits to an Insured Employee or former Employee in the event of Total Disability (unable to perform one or more Main Duties of his/her Specialty in Medicine on a full-time basis due to Injury or Sickness) or Partial Disability (unable to perform one or more Main Duties of his/her Specialty in Medicine on a full-time basis and engaged in Partial Disability Employment).

2. The benefits have a Maximum Benefit Period, which is detailed in the Schedule of Insurance, beyond which they will not be paid. If the policy includes a Family Income Benefit, this will not increase due to the Insured Employee's receipt of Progressive Income Benefit.

3. The maximum benefit for any one Insured Employee is $5,000, or the Company's expected liability for the Insured Employee's Long-Term Disability claim (whichever is less).

4. If the Insured Employee returns to work and earns more than the specified percentage of Predisability Income during the Elimination Period and Maximum Benefit Period, they will no longer qualify for Monthly Benefits. However, if the disability recurs, benefits may be reinstated under certain conditions.

5. The policy defines Total Disability and Partial Disability, providing guidelines for determining eligibility for Monthly Benefits.

6. The list of numbers provided ([1, 28, 31, 36, 41]) seems unrelated to the policy description and might be irrelevant or a typo. If they are related, I would need more context to understand their significance.

This Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf details a Long-Term Disability policy with an Own Occupation Period. During the initial period (Own Occupation Period), the insured employee is considered disabled if unable to perform main duties of their own occupation, possibly working part-time in another role. After this period, disability is determined by inability to perform any occupation matching the employee's training, education, or experience.

The policy includes an Elimination Period during which benefits are not paid. The Maximum Benefit Period sets a limit on how long benefits can be received. Loss of professional licenses does not constitute Total Disability. The insured employee can choose not to engage in Partial Disability Employment during this period, and partial benefits will still be paid for any part of the month.

The policy applies to full-time employees working at least 30 hours per week who become eligible upon starting active employment. There are no employee contributions required for Long-Term Disability coverage. The policy's year ends on December 31st, with no specified Collective Bargaining Agreements or Plan Trustees mentioned. A detailed description of Benefits, Pre-Existing Condition Limitation, Exclusions, and Prior Carrier Credit provisions are included in the provided Certificate of Group Insurance.

This information from Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf, found on pages 4 and 30, details the Voluntary Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit and the Reasonable Accommodation Benefit. If an insured employee is disabled and receiving policy benefits, they may be eligible for a Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit that includes vocational evaluation, counseling, training, job placement, job modification, or special equipment. The Company will determine eligibility and the amount of any benefit payable, which must not exceed their expected claims liability. This benefit does not cover services under the insured employee's health care plan or any other vocational rehabilitation program. Payment may be made to the provider of the services at the company's option. However, the policy will not cover any period of disability for an insured employee who has received a Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit and failed to complete the program without good cause.

This information from Lincoln Cert 5439094.pdf outlines a group long-term disability insurance policy with The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company. In the event of an employee transferring carriers, prior insurance credit will be provided to prevent loss of coverage for those insured under the prior carrier's policy on its termination date, subject to premium payments. This applies to employees who were not actively-at-work due to injury or sickness on the policy's effective date and were insured by the prior carrier's policy at that time.

Coverage will be according to the prior carrier's policy provisions, with the company paying the benefit minus any amount for which the prior carrier is liable. There are separate provisions for employees who have a pre-existing condition, addressing both total disability and the application of the pre-existing condition exclusion under the policy and the prior carrier's policy.

If an employee cannot satisfy either the policy's or the prior carrier's pre-existing condition exclusion, no benefit will be paid. The Plan Administrator is responsible for administering the plan, including receiving contributions, maintaining records, authorizing administrative expenses, selecting the insurance consultant, and selecting the insurance carrier.

The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company holds sole discretionary authority to determine eligibility and administer claims in accord with its interpretation of policy provisions. This does not apply to employers situated in California or California residents. The plan is administered directly by the Plan Administrator, with benefits provided according to the group insurance policy issued by The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company.
