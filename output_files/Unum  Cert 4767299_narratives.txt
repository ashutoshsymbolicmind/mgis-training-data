This Unum Short Term Disability Plan offers financial protection by providing a portion of your pre-disability income during disability. Your benefits are determined by your earnings prior to disability onset. In specific instances, you can receive payments even while working during disability. The plan, as detailed in Unum Cert 4767299.pdf [5], offers coverage up to 60% of your base monthly earnings for a maximum of 13 weeks, with a 7-day waiting period before benefits commence.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, effective date for policy coverage is July 1, 2009 as detailed in row 11 on page 7. This means the insurance becomes active from that specific date forward. The policy details the benefits and conditions of the long-term disability coverage under this contract, with further provisions specified elsewhere in the document.
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 4767299 policy number 95460 details the coverage, specifying that the policy benefits are payable to the beneficiary after the insured's death. The policy term is for a period of ten years from the issue date or until age 65, whichever comes later. Monthly premium payments are required throughout the policy term at the rate of $108.23, and partial disability benefits amount to 70% of the monthly benefit if disabled due to an injury or sickness. The coverage is for a sum insured of $150,000, with a lump-sum payment made upon death or policy termination. If the policyholder dies within three months from the issue date, a refund of all premiums paid will be given, minus any administrative charges.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, eligible groups for coverage include all full-time employees actively employed in the United States with the employer. This policy applies only to those working stateside for the specified employer. The eligibility criteria extend to all such employees and is contingent on their continued active employment status within the country. The terms of this insurance are subject to the conditions outlined in the document.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, at least 30 hours of weekly work is mandated for eligible employees to qualify for coverage under the policy. This means that to benefit from the insurance, an employee must consistently work a minimum of 30 hours per week.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, employees who were part of an eligible group before July 1, 2009 have no waiting period for physician services. Those entering an eligible group after this date require 90 days of continuous active employment with no waiting period. All other employees not eligible in another group must also fulfill the 90-day requirement. This policy does not apply to employees who joined before July 1, 2009, as they have no such restriction.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 7, rows 39-40, if your employment ends and you are rehired within a year, the waiting period for benefits may be waived as long as your previous employment fell under an eligible group. All other policy provisions apply. In this case, prior work would contribute towards meeting the waiting period requirement.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf (page 7, rows 44-45), any prior employment period you had with your employer will be considered when determining the waiting period for your eligibility date. In other words, any work history preceding your current coverage with this specific employer may contribute to waiving or shortening the standard waiting period that usually applies to new policies. This policy provision is crucial if you have worked with your employer in the past but did not have disability insurance during that time.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on page 7, the cost of coverage is primarily determined by your employment status. Physicians and full-time administrators or presidents are covered by their employer, while you personally pay for your coverage if you're a physician partner or owner. This information is detailed in rows 49, 50, 52, and 53 of the same document.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, the elimination period for Short Term Disability (STD) benefits is either 90 days or the end date of any applicable STD payments from B@G-LTD-2 (as of 7/1/2009). Benefits commence following completion of this period and are initiated on the day after.

Under the Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance Benefit detailed in Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 8 (row 64, 66, 67, 69, 70), a disabled policyholder receives 10% of their gross disability payment, up to a maximum of $1,000 per month while participating in the rehabilitation program and not able to find employment for three months following the end of their disability. These payments continue only if the policyholder remains unable to work after it is determined they are no longer disabled.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299, page 9, row 17, under the Minimum Benefit section, pre-existing conditions are subject to a 3/12 provision. This means that if you have a health issue that was diagnosed or treated within 12 months before your policy start date, benefits related to that condition may be limited for the first 3 months after your policy begins. This limitation applies only to benefits directly related to the pre-existing condition and not to any other covered conditions under the policy. The 3/12 provision does not apply if you have been continuously covered by another group or individual health plan without a significant break in coverage for at least 12 months prior to your Unum policy start date.
<EOS>
According to the Long Term Disability Plan outlined in Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 7 (rows 5-7), financial protection is provided during disability by paying a portion of your pre-disability income. The amount received is contingent on your previous earnings, and under certain circumstances, you may still receive payments even while working part-time or with partial disability. Key considerations include the plan's definition of disability and its impact on payment eligibility, as well as provisions for return to work and potential cessation of benefits after a set period or age.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, the waiting period for disability benefits varies based on employment start date. For employees within an eligible group before July 1, 2009, there is no waiting period for Physician Partners/Owners, Physicians, FT Administrator, or President.

This benefit was instituted on July 1, 2009 (B@G-LTD-3).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, the monthly benefit you receive (encompassing all benefits under this plan) will not surpass 100% of your earnings, except during participation in their Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program.

<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, under the Other Features section (page 9, row 11), a crucial provision is Continuity of Coverage. This feature ensures that if you were covered by this policy and then later become re-employed with an eligible employer group plan, your coverage will continue without interruption, provided that you return to work within 60 days after leaving your prior employment and elect this option within 31 days from the effective date of the new group coverage. The Continuity of Coverage provision allows for a seamless transition between plans, subject to certain conditions. This means that as long as you meet the specified timeframes and conditions, you can maintain uninterrupted insurance coverage during employment changes.
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 9 and 10, under rows 23, 24, and 2, outlines the Work Life Assistance Program. Key aspects include access to professional counseling services for emotional, financial, or legal matters, as well as resources for child and elder care.

<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4767299 policy on page 12, it is crucial to notify Unum of a claim promptly, ideally within the first 30 days after disability onset. Written proof of the claim must be provided no later than 180 days post-elimination period, with exceptions for those without legal capacity. If proof cannot be furnished within 180 days, it should be given within a year. The claim form can be obtained from your employer or requested directly from Unum. If you do not receive the form within 15 days of your request, submit written proof of claim regardless. Notify Unum immediately upon returning to work in any capacity.
<EOS>
To file a claim under Unum Cert 4767299.PDF, both you and your employer are required to complete the respective sections of the claim form. Upon completion, submit the form to your attending physician. The physician should then fill out their section of the form and send it directly to Unum for processing. This process ensures prompt evaluation of your claim.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, proof of claim requires:

1. Evidence of regular medical care from a physician.
2. Documentation of your pre-disability monthly earnings.
3. The date and cause of your disability.
4. Details about the extent of your disability, including any restrictions and limitations affecting your ability to work.

6. In some cases, ongoing proof of regular medical care may be required within 45 days of request.
7. Unum may also ask for authorization to access additional medical and non-medical information.
8. Failure to submit necessary information can lead to claim denial or cessation of payments.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 12 and 13, row numbers 1 to 3, the recipient of payments under LTD-CLM-2 (effective as of 7/1/2009) is you. This long-term disability claim payment is made directly by Unum to you.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on page 13, if an overpayment occurs due to fraud, processing error, or receipt of deductible income sources, you are required to repay the full amount. The method for repayment will be determined by Unum, with recovery capped at the amount paid to you. It is essential to note that Unum will not recover more money than what was initially paid out.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, on page 14, row 3 under Employee-1 (effective July 1, 2009), the policy outlines that the employer contributes 50% towards Short-Term Disability benefits with a weekly benefit amount of $500, subject to a maximum monthly contribution limit of $6,000 per employee. This contribution is to be made for the first 13 weeks of disability. The benefit payable to the employee is 60% of their pre-disability earnings, subject to a maximum weekly benefit amount of $5,000. After the initial 13 weeks, the employee's contributions are required, and the employer's contribution reduces to 25%. This policy specifies that the waiting period for benefits is 7 days. The policy also states that if an employee returns to work on a part-time basis during disability leave, their Short-Term Disability benefit will be reduced proportionately.
<EOS>
Unum's Certificate of Coverage (page 14, rows 1-6) is a statement summarizing the coverage to which you may be entitled, detailing who will receive payments, and outlining any limitations, exclusions, and requirements within your plan. It serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding your policy's provisions and restrictions.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on page 14, you are eligible for coverage if you're employed by your group. The eligibility date is the later of two dates: either the plan's effective date or the day following completion of your waiting period. This means, should the effective date have already passed and you've met the waiting period requirements, you would then be eligible for coverage on the subsequent day.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, your coverage begins based on the cost-sharing structure and application timing. If your employer fully covers the policy, you are insured from the moment you're eligible for coverage. Alternatively, if you share costs with your employer or pay completely yourself, coverage starts at 12:01 a.m., either on the date of eligibility if you apply within that timeframe, or within 31 days afterward, or upon approval of your application (if evidence of insurability is required due to late application or voluntary cancellation). Evidence of insurability can be obtained from your employer when necessary. This document outlines specific requirements for this policy regarding coverage commencement.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 14, rows 1 and 2, if you are absent from work due to injury, sickness, temporary layoff, or leave of absence, your coverage will commence upon your return to active employment. This policy does not provide benefits during periods of inactivity at work.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 14, rows 1-3, if you experience a temporary layoff and pay the premium, your coverage will be maintained until the end of the month following the month your temporary layoff commences.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on page 15, if an employee is on a leave of absence and premiums are paid, coverage will continue through the month immediately following the one in which their leave begins. This policy applies during leaves that start on or after July 1st, 2009.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, any changes to your coverage, whether an increase or addition, become effective immediately if you're in active employment, on a covered layoff, or leave of absence. If you're not working due to illness or injury, the increased or additional coverage commences upon your return to work. Decreases in coverage take effect instantly without impacting any claims that were payable prior to the decrease.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, your policy or plan coverage ends on the earliest of: (1) the date you're no longer in an eligible group, (2) the date your eligible group is no longer covered, (3) the last day of the period for which required contributions were not made, (4) the last day you're in active employment unless specified under the covered layoff or leave of absence provision, or (5) the policy cancellation date. Unum may cancel the policy if participation requirements are not met, there are fewer than 10 employees insured, required information is not provided promptly, or obligations related to the policy are not fulfilled. Coverage provides for a payable claim that occurs while you're covered under the policy or plan. Additionally, nonpayment of premium and failure to meet policy-related obligations can lead to cancellation.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 15, rows 1-3, you can initiate legal action for your claim within 60 days following proof of claim submission, with the option to do so up to 3 years from the time required proof is due. Federal law exceptions may apply in certain cases.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, any statements you or your employer make in a signed application for coverage are considered as representations, not warranties. Incomplete or untrue statements may lead to the reduction, denial of claims, or cancellation of your policy from its original effective date. This action will be based solely on statements in the signed application.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on page 16 rows 3, 1, 3, 4, and 5, if the employer provides inaccurate information about you, the policy will apply the facts to determine your plan coverage and premium amounts, and make a fair adjustment of the premium as necessary.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, it is a crime to knowingly and intentionally provide false, incomplete, or misleading information to Unum for insurance fraud purposes. This includes filing a claim with such information. Such actions will lead to claim denial and may result in prosecution and punishment under state and federal law. Unum promises to focus on detection, investigation, and prosecution of insurance fraud, and will pursue legal remedies when needed. The policy emphasizes that engaging in this behavior will not spare you or your employer from additional insurance costs.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, this policy does not substitute or alter any obligations related to workers' compensation or state disability insurance coverage. In other words, you will still need to comply with the requirements for these coverages as usual.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 16 and 17, your employer acts as an agent either for their own interests or on your behalf under this policy. However, it's important to note that your employer will never be considered an agent of Unum under any circumstances. This rule has been in effect since STD-BEN-1 on July 1, 2009.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, disability is defined as a condition where an individual cannot perform the material and substantial duties of their regular occupation due to sickness or injury, resulting in a 20% or more loss in indexed monthly earnings. This determination requires regular medical care. Loss of a professional license or certification does not automatically qualify for disability benefits. Unum reserves the right to have examinees evaluated by physicians, other medical practitioners, and vocational experts, covering examination costs. Frequent examinations are permissible, as well as interviews with authorized Unum representatives.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, if you qualify for benefits under items 1, 2, and 3 in the deductible sources of income section, your Long Term Disability payment may be estimated and reduced if these benefits have not been awarded, denied, or are being appealed. However, your payment will NOT be reduced if you appeal your denial to all administrative levels and sign Unum's payment option form, promising to repay any overpayment caused by an award.

Your payment reduction is adjusted upon receiving proof of the awarded amount or when all necessary appeals are completed, at which point a lump sum refund will be issued. If you receive a lump sum from any deductible sources, it will be pro-rated monthly over the given time period, with a reasonable one applied if none is stated.
<EOS>
Under Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, if you're disabled and still working, your disability days are counted towards the elimination period. This means that if you have accrued enough days of disability while employed, you may satisfy the elimination period requirements for claim approval. The elimination period is typically 30-180 days depending on your policy. It's essential to understand this rule, as it directly impacts the timeframe for your benefits eligibility should you become disabled during employment.
<EOS>
According to Unum  Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 26 and 27, under rows 1, 2, 3, 2, and 3, payments will be made once your claim is approved, if the elimination period has passed and you are indeed disabled. The payments are issued monthly for any duration that Unum is responsible for. This information pertains to LTD-BEN-2 from July 1, 2009.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, your disability payment will be determined by the following process: Your monthly benefit amount is calculated as a percentage of your pre-disability earnings, up to the maximum monthly benefit specified in the policy, and paid monthly for the duration of your disability, until you reach the Normal Retirement Age (NRA), at which point it may be converted into a retirement benefit. The percentage depends on your occupation: If you're engaged in sedentary work, it's 60%; if light or medium, it's 70%, and for heavy, skilled, or semi-skilled labor, it's 85%. Your pre-disability earnings cannot exceed the policy's maximum earnings limit. If you have any questions, please refer to your specific policy for details.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, section 3, the weekly gross disability payment you receive is either the maximum benefit specified in the policy or your calculated weekly disability amount (whichever is less). This means that if your disability calculation yields a higher figure than the maximum weekly benefit, the latter will be applied to your payments. Please refer to page 18, row 4 for further details on this policy.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, page 27, row 9, the monthly payment figure (Item 4) you receive under disability coverage is subject to deduction of any other sources of income. This means that if you earn an additional income during your disability period, it will be subtracted from your disability payment. This policy helps ensure that you do not exceed your total income limit while receiving disability benefits.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 18 and 19, "Weekly Earnings" for Physician Partners/Owners is the average of your ordinary income from trade or business activities (Schedule K-1) and wages, tips, and other compensation (W-2) over the lesser of three recent tax years or your period as an owner, if less than 3 years. Excluded are car, housing, moving allowances, Employer contributions to a deferred compensation plan, and income from sources other than your Employer. For all other Employees, it's their total income before taxes for the calendar year prior to disability or their employment period if no W-2 was issued. Excluded are similar allowances, deferred compensation plan contributions, and non-Employer income. The total income is before taxes and any pre-tax deductions, including Section 125 plans or flexible spending accounts (STD-BEN-3, 7/1/2009).
<EOS>
During a covered layoff or leave of absence as detailed in Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, if you become disabled, your monthly earnings for disability benefits will be based on your pre-absence employment. Specifically, we will reference the income from your employer effective just prior to when your absence begins. This means that your previous salary before going on leave or being laid off will determine your benefits in the event of a disability during this period.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 28 rows [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11], if you become disabled due to the same sickness or injury, and your monthly disability earnings are less than 20% of your indexed monthly earnings, Unum will send a monthly payment. If your disability earnings fall between 20% and 80%, Unum calculates your payment: for the first 12 months while working, there's no reduction in your monthly payment as long as the combined disability earnings and gross disability payment do not surpass 100% of indexed monthly earnings.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, your lost earnings will be calculated as a percentage of your weekly income for the benefit period. To determine this percentage, simply divide your total lost earnings by your weekly salary. This figure represents the amount you'll receive under the policy. The benefit period is not specified in this document; please refer to other sections or contact Unum for further details. Keep in mind that this policy may change over time and is subject to various conditions and exclusions, as detailed elsewhere in the document.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Cert 4767299.pdf (page 19, rows 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21), your weekly payment will be multiplied by the number in Item 2. You must submit evidence of your disability earnings weekly, and Unum reserves the right to adjust this payment accordingly. Proof of income may require appropriate financial records. These records are necessary for Unum to substantiate your reported earnings.
<EOS>
According to Unum's policy as detailed in Cert 4767299, page 29 rows 1-10, if your disability earnings fluctuate significantly month-to-month, the company may calculate an average of your earnings over the past three months to determine the continuation of your claim. The claim will not be terminated unless the average of your disability earnings for the last three months exceeds 80% of indexed monthly earnings. During any month where your disability earnings surpass 80% of your indexed monthly earnings, Unum will not provide payment to you.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, when disability payments are issued, gross payments will be reduced by any deductible sources of income. These sources may include, but are not limited to, workers' compensation benefits, Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and state disability insurance. The reduction percentage depends on the specific type of benefit received. For example, SSDI or SSI benefits will result in a 50% reduction, while workers' compensation benefits may lead to an 85% reduction. It is essential to notify Unum of any income from these sources to avoid overpayment.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, page 20 rows 2, 4, and 5, your disability income payments are excluded if they come from state compulsory benefit acts or laws, as well as other group insurance plans. This means that the benefits you receive under these sources will not impact the disability payments you may be entitled to under this policy. The policy is designed to provide you with income replacement in case of a disabling illness or injury that prevents you from working and meeting the definition of disabled as specified in the policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, page 20 row 8, under Title 46, United States Code Section 688 (The Jones Act), the benefit amount received is subject to a specific formula. This calculation includes wages earned during the first three nautical miles, multiplied by 50%, and the remaining unlimited miles, multiplied by 25%. Notably, these percentages are applicable for each day of total disability resulting from an injury or sickness. The daily wage is calculated based on the average monthly earnings during the 36-month period immediately preceding the date of injury or disability.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, disability payments under your employer's retirement plan are considered if they don't reduce the benefits that would have been paid without disability. Retirement payments stem from your employer's contributions to the plan. Disability benefits reducing the retirement benefit are also regarded as retirement benefits. Simultaneously throughout your lifetime, Unum considers both your and your employer's contributions. Retirement funds not rolled over or transferred to an eligible retirement plan as per IRC Section 402 are excluded. Unum will subtract only deductible sources of income resulting from the same disability. The eligibility for retirement plans follows the definition in IRC Section 402, inclusive of any future amendments. These payments begin when reaching either age 62 or the normal retirement age defined in your employer's plan.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, sources of income that are not deductible from gross disability payments include various types such as 401(k) plans, profit sharing plans, thrift plans, tax-sheltered annuities, stock ownership plans, non-qualified deferred compensation plans, pension plans for partners, military pensions and disability income, credit disability insurance, franchise disability income plans, retirement plans from another employer, individual retirement accounts (IRA), individual disability income plans, salary continuation or accumulated sick leave plans. These sources also include LTD-BEN-6 from July 1, 2009.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on page 31, the minimum monthly payment under this policy is set at either $100 or 10% of your gross disability payment. In case of an outstanding overpayment, Unum may apply this amount towards it. It's important to note that this minimum payment serves as a base and could potentially be higher depending on other factors within the policy terms.

According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, payments will be made monthly for a maximum period based on the policy holder's age at disability. This period ranges from 12 months for those aged 69 or older, up to 60 months for individuals turning 62 while the policy was in effect. For ages between 63 and 68, the duration decreases from 48 months to 24 months. The year of birth impacts the Social Security Normal Retirement Age (ranging from 65 years for those born before 1937 to 67 years for those born after 1960). The policy details state that payments will cease once this maximum period is reached, or when the policy holder returns to work and no longer meets the disability definition.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, payments will cease when the claim ends on the earliest occasion among the following:

1. If you can work part-time in your regular occupation and choose not to, or if you are working with monthly disability earnings exceeding 80% of your indexed monthly earnings. The cessation occurs on the date your earnings surpass 80%.
2. At the end of the maximum payment period.
3. If you no longer meet the plan's disability criteria, unless eligible for Unum's Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program.
4. If proof of continuing disability is not submitted, or after 12 months of payments if residing outside the United States or Canada (considered as such when you spend a total of 6 months or more in these countries during any consecutive 12-month period of benefits).
5. Upon your death.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, the following disabilities are not covered under the plan: self-inflicted injuries, participation in a riot, loss of a professional or occupational license/certification, commission of a crime for which conviction has occurred, and pre-existing conditions. Additionally, the plan does not cover disabilities due to war, act of war, or any period of disability during incarceration. This information applies from 7/1/2009 (LTD-BEN-9).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, if your current disability is related to the same cause(s) as a previous one for which Unum made payments, and you've worked full-time for your employer for 14 days or less between these periods, your current disability will be considered recurrent and exempt from a new elimination period. However, if you've worked full-time for 15 days or more, your current disability claim will be treated as a new one, subject to the plan's provisions, requiring a new elimination period and maximum payment duration. This policy update was implemented on July 1, 2009 (STD-BEN-7).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, if a disability for which payment has been made persists while you work full time for your employer for less than one day, it will be considered part of the prior claim, adhering to the same plan terms as before. If this condition is not met, the disability will be treated as a new claim, subject to all policy provisions. Simultaneous receipt of payments from any other group short-term disability plan renders you ineligible for Unum payments (STD-OTR-1, 7/1/2009).
<EOS>
This information from Unum Cert 4767299.pdf (pages 36-37) outlines the Vocational Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program. Eligibility for this program is at Unum's discretion, contingent upon medical ability for return-to-work. The claim file will be assessed by a rehabilitation professional to determine if a tailored rehabilitation plan is suitable. Services offered within the plan may include employer coordination, adaptive equipment or job accommodations, vocational evaluations, job placement, resume preparation, job seeking skills training, and education/retraining expenses for a new occupation (effective 7/1/2009). A written rehabilitation plan will be provided to the beneficiary.
<EOS>
Under the Unum Cert 4767299 policy, a supplementary disability benefit of 10% (up to $1,000 per month) is provided in addition to your regular disability payment. This extra benefit isn't affected by Deductible Sources of Income provisions that might otherwise increase or decrease the amount. However, the Total Benefit Cap applies.

During the period you are participating in the Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program and cannot find employment after your disability ends, Unum will provide monthly payments for a duration of three months from the end date of your disability. This payment may be given as a lump sum.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, the Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program benefits will cease on the earliest of these dates: (1) when Unum determines you're no longer eligible for the program, or (2) any other date where monthly payments would stop under this plan.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Cert 4767299.pdf at page 27, row 6, your gross disability payment under this policy is determined by comparing the two amounts specified: the maximum monthly benefit and your actual monthly earnings prior to disability. If your earnings are lower than the maximum monthly benefit, that lower figure will serve as your gross disability payment. The maximum monthly benefit is subject to change based on factors such as inflation and policy updates. This comparison determines the amount you receive during the period of your disability, subject to any policy limitations or exclusions.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 27, rows 1-5, the monthly benefit you receive from this policy, encompassing all benefits provided under the plan, will not exceed 100% of your earnings. However, if you participate in Unum's Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program, the combined monthly benefit will not surpass 110% of your income.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, pages [27, 28], the term "Monthly Earnings" for Physician Partners/Owners is determined by averaging Schedule K-1 and W-2 income over the lesser of three tax years or the time as an owner (if less than 3 years). This sum is derived from "ordinary income (loss) from trade or business activities" in Schedule K-1 and "wages, tips, and other compensation" on the W-2 form. It includes pre-tax earnings before any tax contributions to a qualified deferred compensation plan, but excludes allowances, such as car or housing, Employer contributions to plans, and income from non-Employer sources.

   For Physicians, FT Administrator & President, "Monthly Earnings" can be calculated either by the W-2 income for the year prior to disability or over their employment period if no W-2 was issued beforehand. The "average gross monthly income" is the total earnings before taxes, without deductions for pre-tax contributions, Section 125 plans, or flexible spending accounts, and excludes allowances, Employer plan contributions, and income from non-Employer sources. This information was updated on LTD-BEN-3 (7/1/2009).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, if the outcome of Item 1 equals or falls below 100% of your indexed monthly earnings, no further payment reduction is made. Conversely, when it exceeds 100%, Unum deducts the excess from your monthly payment. After a year of payments while working, you will receive payments relative to the disability-induced income loss percentage.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, the percentage of lost earnings is calculated by dividing your disability benefit by your indexed monthly earnings (as stated on page 28, row 27). This means that the percentage represents how much of your original income you are receiving during your period of disability. The calculation ensures fair compensation while taking into account any changes in your income over time.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf (page numbers 28, 29), your monthly disability payment will be multiplied by the figure provided in Item 2. Unum may request proof of your disability earnings at least quarterly, and adjust payments based on these quarters. Required financial records to substantiate income might include appropriate documents. After the elimination period, if disabled for less than a month, you receive 1/30th of the payment per day. This policy follows LTD-BEN-4 (7/1/2009). The payment details are outlined on rows [30, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 2, 3, 1, 2].
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 29 rows 6, 7, and 8, the benefits you may receive are governed by a workers' compensation law, an occupational disease law, or any other legislation with similar intent. The percentage of wages replaced can vary, but in most cases, it will not exceed 2/3 of your pre-disability earnings. These benefits are subject to federal income tax and may also be subject to state taxes. Any potential future increases in the benefit amount will be based on cost-of-living adjustments. You have up to five years from the date you stopped working or became disabled, whichever is later, to file a claim for benefits under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, the disability income amount you receive is subject to certain conditions. Exclusions apply to any state compulsory benefit act or law, other group insurance plans, and governmental retirement system benefits stemming from your employment with your Employer. Specifically, payments received under these sources do not affect your disability income eligibility or amount. For instance, if you receive a state disability benefit or are enrolled in a group insurance plan unrelated to your job, these payments will not reduce the disability income benefits provided by this policy. Conversely, any governmental retirement system benefits derived from your Employer's employment will not be included as part of your disability income. This information can be found on pages 29, rows 11, 13, 14, and 15 of the document.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 29 (rows 18-23), the disability payments you may receive due to your incapacity are contingent on benefits from various sources. These include Social Security Act of the United States, Canada Pension Plan, Quebec Pension Plan, and any similar plans or legislation. The total amount you, your spouse, and children collectively receive will be reduced by the combined disability payments derived from these sources. The exact percentage of reduction depends on the specific plan, but it may not exceed 85% in aggregate. It is essential to note that if a beneficiary receives Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI), they will be considered as having no disability for Unum's purposes.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, under section related to retirement payments (page 29, rows 26-32), if you receive retirement benefits from the United States Social Security Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the Quebec Pension Plan, or any similar plan/act, your dependent children may also receive these payments. This provision applies if you pass away before reaching the normal retirement age of your respective pension plan. The amount your dependents receive is a percentage of your retirement benefit, determined by the specific plan's rules.
<EOS>
This information from Unum Cert 4767299.pdf reveals that disability payments under your employer's retirement plan are defined as those benefits paid due to disability that do not reduce the retirement benefit if no disability occurred. Retirement payments, on the other hand, are based on your employer's contributions to the retirement plan. Disability benefits reducing the retirement benefit will also be considered as a retirement benefit.

Unum considers both your and your employer's contributions to be distributed simultaneously throughout your lifetime, regardless of distribution methods. The definition of an eligible retirement plan is according to Section 402 of the Internal Revenue Code, including any future amendments. Additionally, amounts received do not include rolled over or transferred amounts to any eligible retirement plan. This is valid from July 1st, 2009 onwards.
<EOS>
Under Unum's policy as outlined in Cert 4767299.pdf, except for retirement payments, only deductible income stemming from the same disability will be subtracted from your benefit. This does not include Social Security retirement income if your disability commences post-age 65, provided you were already receiving Social Security retirement benefits prior to this disability onset. The Jones Act applies throughout these stipulations.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, when deductible income sources are subtracted from your gross disability payment, Unum will not subsequently adjust the payment due to any cost-of-living increases derived from that specific source. Essentially, once these income sources have been accounted for in the initial payment calculation, they no longer impact subsequent adjustments tied to cost-of-living increases.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, the lifetime cumulative maximum benefit period for disabilities due to mental illness is 24 months. Benefits will not exceed this limit regardless of whether the disabilities are continuous or unrelated. However, payments may continue beyond the 24-month period if you meet specific conditions as outlined in LTD-BEN-8 (7/1/2009). The document is found on pages [32, 33] with related information at rows [1, 2, 4, 2, 3, 1, 3, 4].
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf on pages 33, rows 7-15, during your hospital confinement beyond the initial 24-month period, benefits will continue. If you remain disabled post-discharge, further payments are granted for a recovery period of up to 90 days. Rehospitalization within this recovery phase, persisting for at least 14 days consecutively, triggers additional payment during this confinement and another 90-day recovery period.
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 4767299.pdf policy detail (pages 33, rows [18-19, 20, 22-23, 25, 27-28, 29, 30-31, 32, 33]) outlines that if you continue to be disabled after the initial 24-month payment period, and are hospitalized or institutionalized for 14 consecutive days, Unum will provide further payments during your reconfinement. Payments will cease either upon reaching the specified limited pay period or maximum payment duration, whichever comes first. The policy does not apply a mental illness limitation to dementia stemming from stroke, trauma, viral infection, Alzheimer's disease, or other conditions not typically treated by mental health providers using psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or similar treatments.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, a pre-existing condition is defined as having received medical treatment, consultation, care, or services (including diagnostic measures) or taken prescribed drugs or medicines within the three months preceding your effective date of coverage. If your disability starts within the first 12 months after coverage activation, it will be considered a pre-existing condition.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, if your disability recurs within 6 months of the end of a prior claim while being continuously insured under the plan, it will be treated as an extension of the previous claim and you will not have to meet another elimination period. Conversely, any recurrence after 6 months will be considered a new claim subject to all policy provisions, including the elimination period. It is essential to note that if you become entitled to payments under any other group long-term disability plan, you will no longer be eligible for benefits under this Unum plan (effective as of 7/1/2009).
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 4767299.pdf section (rows [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 30, 32, 33] on page [35]) outlines the survivor benefit and terminal illness option. If you have been receiving disability payments for over 180 days and die, your eligible survivors receive a lump sum equal to 3 months of your gross disability payment. If there are no eligible survivors, the payment goes to the estate. However, any overpayment on your claim will be addressed first.

If diagnosed terminally ill with a life expectancy less than 12 months and receiving monthly payments, you may receive a lump sum equivalent to 3 months of gross disability payments. To do so, you must make this election in writing to Unum and have a physician certify your terminal illness and reduced life expectancy. This benefit is available once on a voluntary basis and will replace the 3-month survivor benefit upon your death.
<EOS>
Upon policy activation with Unum, coverage is granted if you are jobless due to illness or injury and were previously insured. Coverage is contingent upon premium payment. Your premium will match the amount your prior carrier would have paid. Any liability owed to your previous carrier will result in a corresponding reduction of your payments. This information can be found on Unum  Cert 4767299.pdf pages 35 and 36, rows 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 2, 3 (LTD-OTR-2, 7/1/2009).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, if your employer changes insurance carriers to Unum and your disability is due to a pre-existing condition, you may receive a payment. To be eligible, you must have been in active employment and insured under the plan on its effective date, and insured by the prior policy at the time of change.

Payments will be determined based on whether you satisfy the pre-existing condition provision under either the Unum plan or the prior carrier's plan. If you do not meet these conditions, no payments will be made. If you satisfy one or both conditions, your payment will be the lesser of the monthly benefit that would have been payable under the terms of the prior plan if it had remained in force, or the monthly payment under the Unum plan.

Your benefits will cease on the earlier of the end of the maximum benefit period under the plan, or the date they would have ended under the prior plan if it had remained in force.

<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4767299 on page 39 rows [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12], Disability Plus benefits are payable when proof of disability under this rider and concurrent monthly payments under the LTD plan are received. The onset of benefits commences at the end of the elimination period specified in the LTD plan. A person is considered disabled when Unum deems that due to sickness or injury, they lose the ability to perform 2 activities of daily living without assistance or verbal cues, or there's a deterioration or loss in intellectual capacity necessitating such aid.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, the Disability Plus benefit is calculated as 20% of your monthly earnings, with a maximum monthly payout of either $5,000 or the limit set by the LTD plan. This benefit isn't influenced by policy provisions apart from the Total Benefit Cap, which may modify the amount based on Deductible Sources of Income.
<EOS>
According to the Disability Plus Rider in Unum Cert 4767299.pdf, certain coverage exclusions and limitations apply.
