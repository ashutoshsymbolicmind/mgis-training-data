This policy, under Class 3 of Plan 2, provides coverage as outlined in the Certificate of Insurance. Notably, the policy includes benefits for accidents and sicknesses, subject to specific terms, conditions, and exclusions as detailed within the document.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages [1], you are eligible for the outlined benefits solely if insured under the Policy for at least 12 months. This Certificate supersedes any other similar documents, serving as a summary of the Policy, subject to its terms. Despite being a Certificate of Insurance, it is not a binding insurance contract. In case of inconsistencies between this Certificate and the Policy, the Policy's provisions take precedence.
<EOS>
This document, Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, details a Group Long-Term Disability Insurance certificate on page 2. Innovative Anesthesia Management, LLC is the policyholder with group number 000010155505. The coverage commenced on February 1, 2012.

The policy has a benefit period of up to age 65. Furthermore, there is an elimination period of 90 days before disability benefits commence.
<EOS>
According to the policy detailed in Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, under Class 3, eligibility is extended to all full-time employees. This means that any individual who holds a full-time position at their workplace may be covered by this insurance plan. The specific benefits and coverage details for these employees are not explicitly stated in the provided section but would likely be addressed elsewhere in the policy document. This information can be found on page 2, row 9 of the Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf document.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, on page 2 row 16, a waiting period is outlined in this policy. The waiting period mandates that no benefits will be payable for any covered injury or illness during the first 90 days following the effective date of this insurance, unless the condition results in death or permanent total disability. If an insured dies or becomes permanently totally disabled within this 90-day window, immediate benefits will be provided without regard to the waiting period. Furthermore, if an insured undergoes a medical examination and is found to have a pre-existing condition at the time of application, the waiting period for that specific condition extends to one year from the policy's effective date.
<EOS>
According to the Benefit Percentage section (Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, pages 2, row 19), the insurance policy provides a death benefit equal to 60% of the policy's face value upon the insured's demise. This percentage applies only if the insured passes away before age 65. If the insured survives until 65 years old, the policy will mature, and the full face value will be paid out. The death benefit is payable in a lump sum to the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries upon receipt of the required documentation and claims process completion.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on page 2, row 22, the maximum monthly benefit is set at $6,000 under this policy. This means that the most amount of financial aid you can receive each month is this figure, should an unfortunate event necessitate it. This benefit amount remains constant throughout the policy's term unless otherwise specified in subsequent amendments or modifications.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, under the Minimum Monthly Benefit section, the long-term disability benefit is either $100 or 10% of the insured employee's monthly salary, whichever is greater. However, for pre-existing conditions, benefits are subject to a Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion as detailed on the policy.
<EOS>
This policy, as outlined in Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf at pages 2, row 32, specifies an elimination period of 90 calendar days for disability resulting from a singular or related sickness or injury. During this period, no benefits will be disbursed. However, within the subsequent 180-day window following the onset of disability, any benefits that accrue are payable.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, the maximum benefit period for sickness, injury, or pre-existing conditions is determined by either the Social Security Normal Retirement Age or the specific periods provided:

   - For employees under age 60, the maximum benefit period varies from 2 to 10 years.
   - From ages 60 to 69, the maximum benefit period increases up to a maximum of 30 years.
   - For those aged 70 and above, the maximum benefit period remains at 30 years.

This duration serves as a time limit for benefits related to sickness, injury, or pre-existing conditions.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 2, the maximum benefit period is subject to a range of durations from 60 months (5 years) down to 12 months, with specific durations at Age 65 being 48 months (4 years), 42 months (3.5 years), 36 months (3 years), 30 months (2.5 years), 24 months (2 years), 21 months (1.75 years), and 18 months (1.5 years). Additionally, for ages between 55 and 64, the maximum benefit period decreases in increments of 6 months until reaching the minimum duration of 12 months at Age 55. This means that the policyholder may receive benefits for a specific period, depending on their age, up to a maximum of 48 months. The exact duration will be determined based on the policyholder's age when the claim is made.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 2 and 3, specifically row numbers 15, 1, and 5, the term 'OWN OCCUPATION PERIOD' refers to a duration commencing at the conclusion of the Elimination Period, lasting for 24 months, exclusively applicable to Insured Employees. This period is initiated on a date determined following the Elimination Period. The insurance coverage applies during this stipulated timeframe if the insured individual is unable to perform their specific occupation's material and substantial duties as a result of an injury or sickness.

<EOS>
On Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf pages 4 and 5, under Basic Monthly Earnings/Predisability Income, the definition refers to an employee's base salary or hourly wage prior to taxes on their last worked day before disability commencement (Determination Date). This figure excludes commissions, bonuses, overtime pay, and other additional compensation, as well as income from sources other than the employer. The amount cannot exceed the lesser of what is shown in the employer's financial records, premium-paid amount, or the Maximum Covered Monthly Earnings permitted by the policy (derived by dividing the Maximum Monthly Benefit by the Benefit Percentage in the Schedule of Benefits). In the case of Partial Disability Monthly Benefit determination, Basic Monthly Earnings will not exceed the amount shown in the employer's financial records. This rule applies to GL3002-CERT-2 10 NC 02/01/12.
<EOS>
As per Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, page 5, row 5, The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company, an Indiana corporation, is the insurer. Its address as per the ISO is 8801 Indian Hills Drive, Omaha, Nebraska 68114-4066.

This indicates that changes to the policy will take effect at the beginning or end of a day, respectively.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, a Disability Benefit under the Retirement Plan is a benefit paid due to disability, as defined in that plan. It does not affect the benefits payable at the normal retirement age if disability had not occurred. If the payment reduces these benefits, it will be considered a Retirement Benefit under the policy. This provision can be found on pages 5, rows 14-20.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, the Elimination Period - shown in the Schedule of Benefits - begins on the first day of disability and ends when the specified number of days is accumulated within a period not exceeding double this timeframe. While disabled, an employee may work full-time for up to the Elimination Period, but only days caused by the same or related sickness or injury contribute towards satisfying this period. Days of returning to full-time work do not count towards the Elimination Period. Only disability days pertaining to the same or a related sickness or injury are considered towards meeting the Elimination Period requirement.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, an Employee or Full-Time Employee is defined as a person who:

* Receives regular wage or salary.
* Is regularly scheduled to work at least the Minimum Hours Per Week shown in the Schedule of Benefits.
* Belongs to an Eligible Class entitled to coverage under the Policy.

This document, Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, on pages 5 and 6 specifically, outlines the Evidence of Insurability - a statement detailing an employee's medical history. This proof is crucial for the company to decide upon acceptance or increased coverage for insurance. Notably, the employee bears the expense for this evidence submission. The relevant section is labeled GL3002-CERT-2 10 NC 02/01/12.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, Family or Medical Leave refers to an approved leave of absence that adheres to the federal FMLA law (Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993) or a similar state law. The leave duration is determined by the employer and not exceeding the approved period by law, typically up to 12 weeks in a 12-month period as defined by the employer. This time can be taken consecutively or intermittently, or on a part-time equivalency basis.

If an employee is entitled to leave under both federal FMLA and a similar state law, they may choose the more favorable option (but not both). An employee on FMLA leave due to their own health condition at Policy coverage commencement is considered inactive. The 12 weeks granted can be utilized for personal or family health reasons. If on an FMLA leave due to one's health condition, they are not considered actively working.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, the Full-Time status for Partial Disability Monthly Benefits pertains to an Insured Employee's typical work schedule before a specific date: either the start of the Elimination Period or an approved leave of absence commencement, should the Elimination Period begin during a leave of absence coverage. The average hours worked at their own occupation during the preceding month are essential for determining Full-Time status.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 6, Injury is defined as an accidental bodily harm that necessitates medical treatment by a Physician and directly and independently causes a Disability that commences while the Insured Employee is under Policy coverage. The disability must persist beyond the recovery period specified in the policy, if any, or it must result in death. This definition applies to injuries occurring both within and outside the United States.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf (page 6), the "INSURANCE MONTH" or "POLICY MONTH" is defined as a duration starting at 12:01 a.m. Standard Time on the first day of any given calendar month, and concluding at 12:00 midnight on the final day of that same calendar month. The Policyholder's place of business determines the initial point of this period.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 6 and 7, Main Duties or Material and Substantial Duties refer to job tasks that are required for the Insured Employee's Own Occupation and cannot be reasonably modified or omitted. The determination of reasonable modification or omission is based on the Americans with Disabilities Act's standards concerning reasonable accommodation, applied regardless of whether the employer is subject to the Act or if the Insured Employee has requested job accommodation. An employer's failure to modify or omit other job tasks does not impair the Insured Employee's ability to perform Main Duties. This interpretation was established on GL3002-CERT-2 10 NC 02/01/12.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 7, the main duties of this policy are defined by both the U.S. Department of Labor Dictionary of Occupational Titles and the general labor market and national economy. The scope of these duties is not confined to a specific firm or work site. Rather, they encompass the tasks typically performed within the industry. These duties may vary from those specifically performed for a particular organization.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 7 (rows 12-17), 'Medically Appropriate Treatment' refers to diagnostic services, consultations, or care that align with the symptoms or disability diagnosis of the insured employee. This treatment must be provided by a physician whose license and specialty match the disabling condition, and it should adhere to generally accepted, professionally recognized standards of medical practice.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, Military Leave is a leave of absence that complies with the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA) and the Employer's leave policy. The duration of this leave must not surpass the period mandated by USERRA law. This leave is subject to federal regulations, ensuring reemployment rights upon return from military service, consistent with the terms of USERRA and any amendments made since 1994.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, page 7 row 29, the Monthly Benefit refers to the amount regularly paid by the company to an Insured Employee who is either Totally or Partially Disabled. The benefit amount can be calculated based on a specific percentage of the employee's pre-disability earnings. For Total Disability, the payment begins when the disability occurs and continues for the duration of the disability. For Partial Disability, the payment commences following a 180-day waiting period post-disability. The exact percentage for each situation is determined based on the employee's occupation classification and their pre-disability earnings. This benefit is subject to certain conditions and exclusions as outlined in the policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, the definition of OWN OCCUPATION or REGULAR OCCUPATION is a comprehensive job description based on the U.S. Department of Labor Dictionary of Occupational Titles. It refers to the occupation, trade, or profession where the Insured Employee was employed prior to Disability and served as the main source of earned income. This definition encompasses any work in the same occupation, whether it's with the current employer, another firm, or self-employed. The presence of a suitable job opening is not a determining factor, nor is the availability of an opening with the current employer or in the local labor market. This collective description covers related jobs, including work performed for pay or profit.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 8 rows 1 and 5, the term 'OWN OCCUPATION PERIOD' refers to a specified duration as detailed in the Schedule of Benefits. This period is crucial because it determines the timeframe for which the policyholder can claim benefits under the "Own Occupation" provision, which is set to commence from February 1st, 2012 (GL3002-CERT-2). During this period, the insured individual may qualify for benefits if they are unable to perform their specific job due to a covered injury or illness. The duration of this period and its implications for benefit eligibility should be carefully considered within the context of the policy's overall terms and conditions.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, Partial Disability or being Partially Disabled is defined as follows: During the Elimination Period and Own Occupation Period, an Insured Employee cannot perform one or more main duties of their own occupation, even if full-time, while engaging in Partial Disability Employment. After this period, the inability applies to any occupation that the employee's training, education, or experience allows, again including cases where they cannot work full-time and are engaged in Partial Disability Employment.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf document outlines the definition of Partial Disability Employment on pages [8] rows [24-36]. According to this definition, if an Insured Employee's hours or production are reduced, job duties are reassigned, or they are working in a lower-paid occupation due to a partial disability, it constitutes Partial Disability Employment. The current earnings during such employment must be at least 20% of the predisability income, but should not exceed the specified percentage as detailed in the Partial Disability Benefit section. This means that the employee's earnings may be restricted between these two percentages during their partial disability employment.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, a Physician is defined as a legally qualified medical doctor licensed to practice medicine, prescribe and administer drugs, or perform surgery, or any other duly licensed medical practitioner deemed by state law as equivalent to a medical doctor. This professional must act within the scope of their license and provide Medically Appropriate Treatment for the Insured Employee's disabling condition. Notably, the Physician is not the Insured Employee or any relative receiving treatment, which includes the employee's spouse, siblings, parents, children, grandparents, and relatives of similar degrees, such as the spouse's relatives.
<EOS>
As per Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, the Policyholder is the individual, corporation, trust, or other entity listed on the policy's Face Page. This designation, specified on page [8], row [58], represents the policy's owner who has all rights and responsibilities associated with it. The Policyholder is accountable for meeting the policy's terms and conditions, including premium payments and adhering to any restrictions or exclusions outlined in the document. It is crucial to understand that the Policyholder holds the primary decision-making authority concerning the policy's management and utilization.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, the term 'Regular Care of a Physician' or 'Regular Attendance of a Physician' entails an insured employee personally visiting a physician as frequently as medically necessary, considering standard medical practice, for effective management and treatment of their disabling condition. This care involves receiving medically appropriate treatment from a physician whose license and specialty align with the disabling condition. The attending physician must certify in writing when the insured employee has reached their maximum point of recovery, indicating that further treatment would be ineffective. Such care is deemed medically necessary until this certification is made.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf section on Regular Occupation (see Own Occupation or Regular Occupation definition) outlines specific criteria for benefit eligibility during disability. According to the policy, if a claimant is unable to perform their regular occupation due to a sickness or injury lasting more than 24 months, total and permanent disability benefits will be payable at 10 NC, effective from February 1, 2012. The policy also specifies that any earnings from the claimant's regular occupation must not exceed 20% of their indexed pre-disability earnings in order to maintain eligibility for benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, a Retirement Benefit, in the context of a Retirement Plan, is a payment that can be distributed as either a lump sum or periodic payments. Notably, these benefits do not account for any contributions made by an Insured Employee. Instead, employee contributions are deemed to be received over their estimated remaining life, regardless of the actual receipt date. This benefit becomes payable upon either early or normal retirement or disability. If a disability occurs, the payment may reduce the benefit that would have been received at the normal retirement age under the plan, but only if it results in a lower benefit amount.
<EOS>
This section from Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf defines a Retirement Plan as a benefit or contribution plan that provides benefits to employees and is not solely funded by their contributions. It excludes 401(k), profit-sharing or thrift plans, informal salary continuance plans, IRAs, TSAs, stock ownership plans, or non-qualified deferred compensation plans. An Employer's Retirement Plan includes any plan that is part of a federal, state, county, municipal, or association retirement system, or for which the insured employee is eligible due to employment with the employer.
<EOS>
This section from Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf describes a Sick Leave or Salary Continuance Plan, a benefit plan provided by the Employer for employees. The plan continues to pay a portion of an Insured Employee's Pre-disability Income for a specific period following Disability. However, this does not include payment for work performed during Disability. It is essential to note that this plan does not involve compensation paid directly for work done while disabled. This information can be found on pages [9] rows [36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42].
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, row 47 on page 9, the term 'Total Covered Payroll' refers to the aggregate of each insured employee's Basic Monthly Earnings under this policy. This total amount serves as a crucial factor determining benefits payable. It is essential that the employer accurately calculates and reports these earnings to ensure prompt and fair claim settlement in case of an unfortunate event.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, during the Elimination Period and Own Occupation Period, Total Disability or being Totally Disabled is defined as an insured employee's inability to perform each of the main duties of their own occupation due to an injury or sickness. After the Own Occupation Period, Total Disability arises when the employee is unable to perform any occupation for which their training, education, or experience allows. Loss of a professional, occupational license, certification, or driver's license alone does not constitute Total Disability. This definition applies to rows [50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59] on page 9 of the document.
<EOS>
According to the policy in Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, there is a waiting period for an employee to become eligible for coverage. This waiting period must be completed continuously, except as explained under Prior Service Credit Towards Waiting Period. The employee should serve before becoming eligible, and this service period applies from the document. No coverage can begin before fulfilling the waiting period requirements specified in the policy dated 02/01/12 (GL3002-CERT-5).
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf pages 10 (rows 4-18), the contract encompasses the insurance policy and its amendments, the Policyholder's application, Participating Employers' applications or Participation Agreements, and individual applications of Insured Employees. Statements from both the Policyholder and Insured Employees are representations, not warranties. An Insured Employee's statement, to challenge policy coverage, must be in a written form signed by the employee and a copy provided to them. In the absence of fraud, these statements are considered non-contestable for coverage.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, the insurance policy's validity is uncontestable after two years from its issue date for all parties, including Insured Employees, provided their coverage has been active for at least two years throughout their lifetime. However, this does not restrict the assertion of defenses based on the policy's eligibility requirements, exclusions, and limitations, or other provisions unrelated to coverage validity. This clause does not affect the ability to contest the policy due to non-payment of premiums or fraud.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939762 policy document allows the company to rescind insurance coverage during the first two years if an Insured Employee makes a Material Misrepresentation on their application and subsequently incurs a claim. A Material Misrepresentation is any incomplete or untrue statement that would have led to coverage rejection had the truth been known. The policy can be canceled back to its effective date, with premiums refunded minus any benefits paid for the Insured Employee's claims. The company also reserves the right to recover excess claim payments over and above the premiums paid.
<EOS>
According to the specified sections in Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, any misstatements of facts about an insured employee may necessitate a revision of the premium and determine the validity of insurance benefits. If an age has been misstated, the corresponding benefits will be equivalent to what the paid premium would secure at the correct age. The truth shall decide whether and in what amount insurance is applicable under the Policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf at pages 10, row 51, the Policyholder is clarified as either acting independently or on behalf of the policyholder themselves, never serving as the Company's agent. It is crucial to note that under no circumstances will the Policyholder be regarded as the Company's representative in any aspect of the Policy.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, all Predisability Income and premium/benefit amounts under this policy are expressed and must be paid in U.S. dollars. This currency requirement is outlined on pages 10, rows 54-57.
<EOS>
This insurance policy outlined in Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf provides benefits mandated by Workers' Compensation laws or any state disability insurance plan regulations. The coverage extends to compensate for lost wages and medical expenses resulting from work-related injuries or illnesses. The benefit amount varies depending on the state's guidelines, typically ranging between 60% to 70% of the employee's average weekly wage.

<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, if an Insured Employee experiences a Disability and fails to receive claim forms within 15 days, they may provide written proof of the disability's onset date, cause, and degree in a letter to the Company.

The proof should include: completed statements by the Insured Employee and Employer; a statement by the attending Physician describing any job limitations; evidence of other income; details of benefits from other sources affecting policy benefits; a signed authorization for additional information; and any other items required by the Company. Proof of continued disability, regular physician care, and other income impacting the claim should be provided within 45 days after requested. Failure to do so may result in benefit suspension. All proof must be submitted within 180 days following the period for which the company is liable.
<EOS>
According to the section in Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, failure to provide notice or proof of claim within a reasonable time frame may reduce the claim, but not invalidate it entirely. The claimant must act as soon as possible and in no event more than one year after the claim was required. However, these time limits do not apply while the claimant lacks legal capacity. This information is found on pages 11, rows 40 to 45.
<EOS>
Under the terms of Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, the insurance company has the right to examine the insured employee, chosen from a pool of physicians, specialists, or vocational rehabilitation experts. These examinations may occur multiple times while a claim or appeal is being processed, all at the company's expense. If the insured employee fails to cooperate with an examiner, declines a scheduled examination, or postpones it more than twice, benefits may be temporarily denied or suspended until the required examination is completed.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 11 and 12, any claims under the policy will be paid once the company has received complete proof of claim and confirmed liability. Benefits will either be paid monthly for the duration of the company's liability, or on a pro rata basis if benefits are due for less than a month (equaling 1/30 of the Monthly Benefit per day). Any remaining unpaid balance will be settled immediately following confirmation of liability and receipt of complete proof.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, benefits are payable to the Insured Employee while alive. Upon death, a Survivor Benefit follows the specified guidelines. Other benefits will be paid to the Insured Employee's estate. If the benefit is payable to the Insured Employee's estate, their legal incompetent heirs, or a minor, up to $3,000 may be given to an entitled relative by the Company without requiring subsequent payment. This provision applies if payment is made in good faith to such a relative.

Under the Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, if a claim is denied partially, the Insured Employee will receive a written notice detailing the denial reason based on the Policy terms and internal guidelines within 15 days after the claim resolution or 45 days following the first proof of claim submission, provided it's reasonably possible. The notice will also explain how to request a review of the decision and whether additional information is required for claim support.
<EOS>
Under the Delay Notice of Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, if the Company requires more than 15 days to process a claim, a written delay notice will be sent to the Insured Employee by the 15th day after receiving the first proof of claim, followed by one every 30 days thereafter until resolution. The notice details what additional information is needed to determine liability and when a decision can be expected. If no decision is made within 105 days after the Company receives the initial claim, an immediate review ensues as if the claim was denied.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, section on page 12, rows 48 and 49, the company reserves the right to request additional information from the insured employee to process a claim. This information must be supplied within 45 days after such a request. Any delay in supplying this information will not impact the standard time limits for claim processing.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, within 180 days of a claim denial, the Insured Employee can request a review by submitting a written request along with any supporting documents. The Company will evaluate the claim and communicate its decision in writing, detailing reasons based on the Policy terms and internal guidelines. If the denial is upheld, the notice includes details on further appeal procedures, access to relevant claim information, and the right to seek state insurance department review or legal action. This notice must be sent within 45 days post-review request, or 90 days if special circumstances apply (GL3002-CERT-6 04 NC 12 02/01/12).
<EOS>
In the case of an appeal requiring more than 45 days for processing as per Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, a delay notice will be sent to the Insured Employee within 30 days after receiving the request. This written notice details the specific circumstances causing the delay, any additional information required to review the claim, and an estimated decision timeline. If extended beyond the initial processing period, a maximum of 45 more days is allowed.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 13 and the relevant rows 20-21, if additional information is required from the Insured Employee during an appeal process, it must be supplied within 45 days after the Company requests it. Notably, this delay does not count towards the overall time limits for the appeal processing.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, if a claim undergoes an adverse decision in this employee benefit plan subject to ERISA (1974), the participant or beneficiary must pursue two administrative reviews first, as per this section's guidelines. After exhausting these remedies, they may file a legal action under Section 502(a) of ERISA. It is essential to note that such actions must adhere strictly to ERISA's procedures and timelines.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 13, rows 31 to 33 outlines that the Company waives any right to claim failure in exhausting administrative remedies, should a claimant encounter such an issue. The waiver applies if the Company receives notice of potential legal action within 180 days after the plan administrator's benefit denial, and the claimant has complied with all reasonable requests for additional information regarding their claim during the administrative review process. This clause operates only in cases where the claim involves an Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) governed plan.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, if overpayments occur on any short-term or long-term disability benefits, the policy holder must reimburse the company within 60 days. Failure to do so allows the company to either reduce future benefits, suspend payment of the Minimum Monthly Benefit, reduce benefits under other group insurance policies, or recover the overpayment from the policy holder's estate. Reimbursement is required regardless of whether the overpayment was due to a processing error, Other Income Benefits received, fraud, misrepresentation, omission of relevant facts, or any other reason.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, any legal action to recover benefits must wait for a minimum of 60 days after the necessary written proof of claim is submitted. Moreover, this legal action can only be initiated within three years from the date the written proof of claim should have been provided. It's essential to note that failure to adhere to these timeframes may result in the inability to pursue a claim for benefits.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf section, found on pages [13, 14], grants the company discretionary authority over the policy. This includes managing the policy, interpreting provisions, handling claims, and resolving disputes. The company may establish administrative procedures, decide eligibility, and determine what information is required for decisions. They also retain the right to resolve internal claim reviews. Any decision made by the company in this regard is conclusive and binding, but the insured employee has the option to request a state insurance department review or bring legal action, excluding California residents. This provision does not affect GL3002-CERT-7 04 13 02/01/12.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, eligibility for insurance is determined by the schedule on pages 14, rows 4 and 5. The company reserves the right to assess and potentially terminate any or all eligible classes under the policy if a class falls outside of the policy's coverage at any given time.
<EOS>
According to the eligibility section in Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, an employee can obtain coverage under the policy on either the date of its issuance or the completion of the waiting period. Notably, the waiting period may range between 30 days and one year, with a standard duration of 180 days. During this period, the employee is not covered by the policy, but once it ends, they become eligible for full coverage as stipulated in the document.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, prior service credit can be applied towards the Waiting Period under specific conditions:

1. If a former Employee is rehired within one year after their employment termination, their previous service counts towards the Waiting Period.
2. If an Employee takes an approved Family or Medical Leave as required by federal law (12 weeks) or a similar state law, their service before leave can be credited during this period.
3. Similarly, if an Employee is on Military Leave in accordance with USERRA law, their prior service will apply towards the Waiting Period within the mandated timeframe.

It is essential to note that these conditions may vary based on the specific laws applicable in each case. The detailed schedule for the Waiting Period can be found in the Schedule of Benefits within the document.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages [14] rows [30-57], an employee's coverage becomes effective at 12:01 a.m. on the latest of their eligibility date, resumption of active work (if not already working actively), or the dates they submit application and required documents for coverage or evidence of insurability approval, if applicable. Increased or additional coverage takes effect on the first insurance month following their eligibility date or resumption of active work, while any decrease in coverage occurs on the day of change, regardless of employment status. Premiums can be deducted from payroll or flexible benefits plan accounts as per employee's preference.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, evidence of insurability is mandatory for the company when an employee applies for coverage or increased coverage more than 31 days after becoming eligible, or requests to cancel, halt payroll deductions, or stop premium payments from the Flexible Benefits Plan account. This requirement also applies if coverage lapses due to non-payment of premiums, or optional, supplemental, or voluntary coverage is elected in excess of any Guaranteed Issue Amounts shown in the Schedule of Benefits. This rule is effective on various pages and rows [14, 15] and [60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 1, 4, 5].
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 15, rows 5-10, an insured employee can transition to a different Eligible Class. The coverage under the new Eligible Class takes effect starting from the first day of the following or coinciding Insurance Month, with the exception that changes in Eligible Class due to increases or decreases may have a different effective date as specified in the Effective Date provision.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939762 document outlines reinstatement rights for an Insured Employee whose coverage terminates due to a break in service, family or medical leave, military leave, or other approved leaves. The reinstatement allows the employee to re-enroll for Policy coverage without satisfying a new waiting period or providing evidence of insurability.

Reinstatement is available within specific timeframes:
1. Upon returning from an approved Family or Medical Leave within 12 weeks (federal law) or any longer state law period, Military Leave within the federal USERRA law period, or any other approved leave within six months after it begins.
2. Within 12 months following a layoff or termination of employment for any other reason.

To reinstate coverage, the employee must apply for coverage or be re-enrolled within 31 days after resuming Active Work in an Eligible Class. The reinstated insurance amount may not exceed the amount that terminated, and it will take effect on the date the Insured Employee returns to Active Work.

The months of leave will count towards any unmet Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion period, and a new Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion will not apply to the reinstated insurance amount. However, a new Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion will apply to any increased amount of insurance.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, an Insured Employee's coverage terminates at midnight on the earliest of:

1. The policy or employer's participation termination date, with claims incurred prior given validity.
2. The date the employee's class is no longer eligible for insurance or when they cease to be a member of an Eligible Class.
3. The last day of the Insurance Month in which they request termination, or that for which premium payment is made on their behalf.
4. The end of the period for which the last required premium has been paid or with respect to a particular insurance benefit, the date the portion of the policy providing that benefit terminates.
5. The employee's employment termination date with the employer, unless continued as provided below, or the date they enter active duty in the armed services of any state or country (except for duty of 30 days or less for training in the Reserves or National Guard). Premium refund is given if proof of military service is sent.
<EOS>
As per Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 16 and rows 31, 33, should an Insured Employee cease active work, their insurance coverage terminates. However, continuation rights enable the coverage to be maintained under specific conditions:

   - If the employee retires, they can continue the insurance by paying the full premium themselves during retirement.
   - If the employee becomes disabled, a reduced level of coverage may be continued without payment from the employee but with a 25% reduction in benefits.
   - If the employee's death occurs within 180 days of ceasing active work due to retirement or disability, their coverage remains effective for the full benefit amount.

These provisions are subject to the terms and conditions of the policy.
<EOS>
This policy from Lincoln Cert 4939762 details disability coverage. If an insured employee is totally disabled and absent, the coverage can be continued during the Elimination Period, given the employer pays the required premium. Post the Elimination Period, benefits are payable without premium payments until they end. Afterward, premiums must be resumed if continuation is desired. The premium is waived from the Elimination Period completion until the benefits' cessation. If coverage continues after a premium waiver period, the premium payments recommence as due. This scheme applies to rows [35-45] on page 16 of the document.
<EOS>
According to the Family or Medical Leave details in Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, if an Insured Employee takes approved Family or Medical leave and is not eligible for more extended disability coverage, insurance can be continued until the earliest of: a) the end of the leave period approved by the employer; b) the end of the 12-week federal law-mandated leave, or any more generous state-law-required duration; c) the date the Insured Employee informs the employer they will not return; or d) when the Insured Employee starts working for a new employer. Throughout this period, required premium payments must be made by the employer. The policy also indicates that if an employee does not return after leave, coverage ceases.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, if an Insured Employee goes on Military Leave, coverage can be continued for the same duration permitted during an approved Family or Medical Leave. The Employer must ensure that premium payments are made consistently throughout this period of extended coverage. Notably, these provisions apply to rows 64, 65, and 67 on page 16.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 16 and 17, if an insured employee experiences a temporary lay-off or takes an approved leave of absence (excluding Family or Medical Leave, Military Leave), coverage can be maintained for three insurance months following the start of the lay-off or leave. The employer is required to make premium payments throughout this period of continued coverage. This arrangement applies to GL3002 policy.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939762 document specifies that the employer must not discriminate unfairly among similar employees in administering the continuation coverage. The insurance may not be continued if an insured employee ceases active work due to a labor dispute, strike, work slowdown, or lockout. This rule applies regardless of the situation.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, during a Disability, an Insured Employee's coverage termination will not impact benefits payable for the duration of that disability. Benefits remain active and payable until the end of the specified period or until the employee returns to work, whichever occurs first. The policy defines Disability as incapacity due to sickness or injury preventing the employee from performing their regular duties for more than 90 consecutive days or more than 180 days in any 365-day period. The policy also mentions that if an Insured Employee's employment terminates, they may continue coverage under certain conditions, such as electing COBRA continuation coverage within the specified time frame.
<EOS>
According to the Conversion Privilege section of Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, you are granted the ability to convert your policy into another policy under certain conditions. This option is available from February 1, 2012 onwards. The conversion must be exercised before the policy anniversary following the insured's attainment of age 75. The new policy's death benefit shall not exceed the original policy's death benefit plus any additional amounts that meet the requirements for tax-free exchanges as stipulated in IRS Section 1035. The conversion ratio is determined based on the lesser of the account value or net level premium basis, and the new policy must be issued within one year from the date the election to convert was made.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, the Policy terminates when an Insured Employee quits, is fired, takes a layoff or leave of absence, or remains on such status beyond the specified continuation period. Eligible Insured Employees can convert their insurance coverage into long-term disability insurance without providing medical evidence. To qualify, they must have been insured under the employer's group plan for 12 consecutive months immediately prior to the Policy termination. This 12-month requirement may include periods covered by the Policy and any preceding group long-term disability plans that this Policy replaced.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, within 31 days after insurance under the policy, application for conversion must be made. Upon conversion, benefits and the amount of insurance may vary from those stated in the original policy. The converted plan might differ substantially from the existing one.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, the conversion privilege is unavailable for an Insured Employee whose insurance ends due to Policy termination by the Employer or Company, amendments excluding their class, no longer being eligible, retirement/death, unpaid premiums, or Disability under the terms of the Policy. This privilege also does not apply if they become insured for long-term disability benefits under another group plan, unless the other coverage starts more than 31 days after their insurance under this Policy ends. If an Insured Employee converts and later resumes eligible employment, their conversion coverage terminates the day before they are re-enrolled under the Policy. Benefits will not be provided concurrently for the same Disability period under both the Policy and conversion coverage. This policy follows GL3002-CERT-9 10 NC Any Occ, Standard Integ. 18 (effective from 02/01/12).
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf document outlines the Total Disability Monthly Benefit conditions. To qualify, an Insured Employee must be Totally Disabled, become disabled while insured, receive Regular Care from a Physician, and provide proof of continued disability and care to the Company upon request. The benefit ceases on the earliest of the Insured's death or Total Disability end date, Maximum Benefit Period expiration, or ability to engage in Partial Disability Employment (either in Own Occupation during the Own Occupation Period or any occupation after this period). Proportional benefits are given for partial months of disability. The Company may deny or suspend payments if the Insured fails a required medical exam without good cause, fails to cooperate with the examiner, postpones a required exam more than twice, does not provide proof within 45 days of request for additional information, or does not provide proof of application for Other Income Benefits within 45 days of request.
<EOS>
This insurance policy from Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf specifies the Total Disability Monthly Benefit, calculated as the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings multiplied by the Benefit Percentage, capped at the Maximum Monthly Benefit. However, this benefit will not be less than the Minimum Monthly Benefit unless the sum of the Minimum Monthly Benefit, Other Income Benefits, and the latter exceed 100% of the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings. The Benefit Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period are detailed in the Schedule of Benefits. It is essential to note that these parameters are subject to change as per GL3002-CERT-10 05 NC Any Occ Def. Res 19 02/01/12.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf detail (rows 4-58 on page 20) outlines the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit for an Insured Employee. The employee qualifies if they're disabled or become disabled while insured, engage in partial disability employment, earn at least 20% of Predisability Income upon starting, are under a physician's regular care (if needed), and submit proof of continued partial disability, physician's care, and reduced earnings. Partial disability benefits can be paid without total disability preceding.

The Elimination Period may consist of days of total or partial disability, or both. The benefit ceases upon the earliest instance of: the employee ceasing to be partially disabled or death; end of the Maximum Benefit Period; earning more than 99% of Predisability Income for 24 months or 85% after 24 months; choosing not to work full-time in own occupation during the Own Occupation Period, or any occupation after this period. Proportional benefits are paid for a partial month.

Partial Disability Monthly Benefit payments may be denied/suspended if the employee fails a required medical exam, doesn't cooperate with the examiner, postpones a required exam more than twice, fails to provide additional proof within 45 days of request, or fails to apply for other income benefits within 45 days of request.
<EOS>
According to the Progressive Calculation section on page 21 of Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, policyholder's GL3002 insurance requires a 20% premium increase effective from February 1, 2012. The new annual premium amount will be calculated using the original sum insured and adjusted for the increase in cost of living. It is essential to submit any required documentation before this date to avoid potential coverage lapses. Furthermore, this policy update applies only to specific lines of coverage as outlined in the document.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 21, rows 5, 6, 8, and 10, the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit is designed to replace lost income of an Insured Employee. This benefit does not surpass the Total Disability Monthly Benefit that would be paid during complete disability in the absence of partial disability employment. The Partial Disability Monthly Benefit amount equals the lesser of two options: A or B. Option A is the difference between the Earnings Before Disability (EBD) and Post-Disability Earnings (PDE). If the PDE exceeds 80% of the EBD, then no Partial Disability Monthly Benefit will be payable. This policy applies only when the Insured Employee's disability results in a reduction of earnings by more than 20%.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf section on page 21, rows 12 and 14 outlines the Lost Income benefits. These benefits encompass the Insured Employee's Predisability Income, excluding any other income they may receive. Crucially, this includes earnings from Partial Disability Employment. The benefits will continue until the employee recovers or reaches retirement age. Additionally, it is essential to note that the benefit amount will be determined based on a percentage of the predisability income, although no specific percentage is provided in this section.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 21 and 22 details the Total Disability Monthly Benefit. The benefit is calculated by multiplying the Insured Employee's Predisability Income with the stated Benefit Percentage, limited to the Maximum Monthly Benefit, while subtracting other income benefits apart from earnings from Partial Disability Employment. Notably, the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit will never fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit. The Benefit Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period are shown in the Schedule of Benefits (GL3002-CERT-11-INT 10 NC Prim & Fam SS Integ). These critical parameters were set on February 1st, 2012.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, any additional income benefits, including awards, settlements, or earnings (excluding Retirement Benefits and ordinary Earnings), will reduce the Insured Employee's Monthly Benefit. Importantly, these benefits must stem from the same Disability for which a Monthly Benefit is payable under the Policy. The offset applies to these specified sources of income, detailed on pages 22 rows 4, 5, and 6 of the document.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf section on pages 22 (rows 9-21) outlines the Workers' Compensation benefits, encompassing job-related injuries or sicknesses under various legal structures such as workers' compensation laws, the Jones Act, Longshoreman's and Harbor Worker's Act, Maritime Doctrine of Maintenance, Wages or Cure, or any alternative plans. These benefits extend to both partial or total disability, whether temporary or permanent, and cover vocational rehabilitation. This policy includes any benefits for either category of disability.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, the insured employee's eligibility for disability income benefits is subject to any other compulsory benefit acts or laws. This encompasses state temporary disability income benefit statutes and additional compulsory benefit laws. The specific benefits and eligibility criteria are contingent upon these compulsory acts or laws, which may require the employee to fulfill certain conditions or meet specific requirements for entitlement. The percentage of benefits and duration may vary depending on the applicable law. Crucially, it is essential to adhere to these regulations concurrently with the disability income policy provisions.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, any group insurance plan (excluding credit or mortgage insurance) that the Insured Employee may be eligible for is subject to the terms and conditions of this policy. The amount of disability income benefits from these other plans will be offset by the benefits received under this specific policy, up to 60% of the employee's pre-disability earnings. This adjustment will take effect if the total disability income benefits exceed 80% of the employee's pre-disability earnings. The insured employee must provide written notice of any other group insurance plan and its benefit amounts as soon as they become aware of them. Failure to do so may result in a reduction or loss of benefits under this policy.
<EOS>
Under the Employee Benefit Plans in Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, disability income benefits eligibility for the insured employee is not impacted by the employer's sick leave or salary continuance plan. Excluded from these benefits are vacation pay, severance pay, and wages earned during a Disability. The employer's arrangements for such leaves or compensations do not affect the disability insurance coverage provided in this policy.
<EOS>
This document, Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf at pages 22 and row 38, outlines the impact of an insured employee's Disability Benefits or Retirement Benefits under their Employer's Retirement Plan. Specifically, if an employee receives either of these benefits, they may be subject to a reduction in their group life insurance coverage by up to 100%. This reduction is contingent on the amount received from the retirement plan. The effective date for this reduction is the later of the disability start date or the retirement date. It's important to note that this provision applies only if the employee's disability or retirement commences after January 1, 2017.
<EOS>
According to the Social Security and other Government Retirement Plans section in Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf (page 22, rows 41-42), any benefits received from Social Security or other government retirement plans will be subject to an offset in this insurance policy. The offset percentage is determined based on the lesser of either the monthly benefit amount under the plan or two-thirds of the monthly benefit amount under the insurance policy. This reduction will commence when the insured begins receiving payments from the government retirement plan. The offset does not apply if the government retirement plan payment is a result of disability, survivorship, or certain other specific circumstances as outlined in the policy document.
<EOS>
According to the Disability Benefits section on pages 22, rows 44-45 of Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, if the Insured Employee becomes disabled, their child is also eligible for benefits. The child's eligibility is contingent upon meeting specific requirements, such as being under age 18 (or up to age 22 if a full-time student) or incapable of self-support due to mental or physical disability. The benefit percentage for the child matches the parent's active monthly salary amount, subject to maximum and minimum limits. The duration of benefits is until the child turns 19 (or 23 if a full-time student), unless the disability continues beyond that point, in which case the child may continue to receive benefits as long as the parent remains disabled and eligible.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 22, rows 47-49, unreduced retirement benefits for the Insured Employee may be eligible and extend to a spouse or child if the employee meets certain conditions. Specifically, these benefits become available when the employee retires under the normal retirement age without reduction in benefit amounts. The defined benefit is calculated based on a percentage of the employee's final average salary multiplied by their years of service. The specific percentage varies depending on the employee's age at retirement and years of service. For example, if an employee retires at age 65 with 30 years of service, they would receive 100% of the defined benefit amount. However, if an employee chooses to retire early, their benefits may be reduced based on the number of months before reaching the normal retirement age. The reduction in benefits varies depending on the number of months early retirement occurs, ranging from a 2/3 reduction for retiring 1 year early to no reduction for retiring just a few months prior to the normal retirement age.
<EOS>
This document, Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, outlines the impact of a reduced retirement benefit received by the Insured Employee, affecting potential benefits for their child. The term "Government Retirement Plans" encompasses disability and retirement benefits under various acts: the federal Social Security Act, Jones Act or Railroad Retirement Act; the Canada Pension Plan or Quebec Pension Plan; any similar plans from countries, states, provinces, or other political units; and any substitute plans. This policy applies to GL3002-CERT-11-INT 10 NC Prim & Fam SS Integ. 22, effective from 02/01/12.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, 'Earnings' refers to any income received or earned by the insured employee from various occupations, as declared for federal tax purposes. These earnings encompass gross salaried or hourly wages, tips, commissions, bonuses, overtime pay, pre-tax contributions towards Section 125 plans, flexible spending accounts, or qualified deferred compensation plans. Additionally, self-employed individuals' net profits are considered as reported on Form 1040, Schedule C. Similarly, this applies to proprietors, professional corporation shareholders, partners with self-employment net earnings shown on Schedule K-1, and Subchapter S Corporation shareholders' net earnings from trade or business activities, all as detailed on the corresponding schedules.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, the following sources will not be considered Other Income Benefits for offset purposes:

1. Cost-of-living increases in any Other Income Benefit (except Earnings) that occur after the first offset during a disability period.
2. Reimbursements for hospital, medical, or surgical expenses and attorney fees/costs associated with claiming Other Income Benefits.
3. Group credit or mortgage disability insurance benefits, early retirement benefits not elected or received under the federal Social Security Act or other Government Retirement Plan, and amounts from Employer’s Retirement Plans (except for those representing employer contributions or received upon termination without disability/retirement).
4. Benefits from 401(k), profit-sharing, thrift plans, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), tax sheltered annuities (TSAs), stock ownership plans, or non-qualified deferred compensation plans.
5. Vacation pay, holiday pay, severance pay, and disability income benefits under any individual policy, association group plan, franchise plan, auto liability insurance policy.

<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, pages 24 rows 5, outlines rules for income benefits that may impact policy benefits. If an insured employee receives other income during the total disability period, these benefits will be offset by a specified percentage (up to 100%) depending on the nature and source of the other income. For instance, workers' compensation or public disability benefits could result in full offset, while earned income may trigger a partial offset up to a maximum amount. Additionally, if the insured employee returns to work with modified duties, they may still receive policy benefits, but these will be reduced by 25% of their earned income. These rules apply during the total disability period and any subsequent periods of partial disability or return to work. It's crucial to note that offsets can affect both short-term and long-term disability benefits.
<EOS>
As per Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, an Insured Employee entitled to Other Income Benefits must actively pursue them. This includes timely application for Social Security Act benefits, requesting reconsideration upon denial, and a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge if denied again (unless the company waives this in writing). Cooperation is also required from employers when their Insured Employee may claim Workers' Compensation or similar benefits. If an Insured Employee delays pursuing Other Income Benefits, the company has the option to either deny/suspend Monthly Benefits or reduce them by an estimated amount.
<EOS>
In accordance with the Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 24, specifically rows 27, 28, and 30, an Insured Employee making a claim for Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits must decide on one of two options in writing. If no election is made, Monthly Benefits will be reduced accordingly, adopting Option 1. There are two available options:

Option 1: The offset begins immediately, and the policy's Monthly Benefits will be reduced by 2/3rds (66 2/3%) of any Social Security or Government Retirement Plan benefits received.

Option 2: The offset delay allows for the deferral of the policy's Monthly Benefits until the Insured Employee reaches their full retirement age, at which point the offset will commence. The reduction in Monthly Benefits under Option 2 will be 50% (50%) of any Social Security or Government Retirement Plan benefits received. No election is made by default, resulting in an immediate offset with a 66 2/3% reduction.

As outlined in the Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, if the Insured Employee's estimated Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits are received, the Policy benefits will be adjusted accordingly. The Company reserves the right to refund any underpayment in a lump sum upon receiving evidence of either the actual awarded amount or the claim denial following completion of any required appeals process. This adjustment and refund occur based on the details provided on pages 24 (rows 32-40).
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 24 (rows 42-48), the insured employee can receive unreduced monthly benefits while a claim is pending. However, it's mandatory to agree in writing to promptly refund any overpayment if Social Security or other government retirement plan benefits are received later. An overpayment that isn't repaid promptly will lead to either the reduction or elimination of future payments, and the Minimum Monthly Benefit won't apply until the amount is settled. Failure to return an overpayment could result in forfeiture of the minimum monthly benefit altogether.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, lump-sum payments of other income benefits are pro-rated over the stated time period or, if none is given, through an estimated monthly offset until full compensation is made. If no estimated offset was in place, the lump sum will be spread over a reasonable duration (not exceeding 60 months or the Maximum Benefit Period) on a monthly basis. The pro-rated method ensures that the policyholder continues to receive payments based on the regular schedule of the benefit.
<EOS>
In the specified sections of Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf (pages 24-25, rows 62, 63, 1, 4, 5), it is stated that once a deduction has been made for Other Income Benefits (all except Earnings), the amount of these benefits will be frozen. No further reduction due to cost-of-living increases under these Other Income Benefits will apply to the Monthly Benefit. This policy modification is effective as of GL3002-CERT-12 04 24 02/01/12.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, a Recurrent Disability refers to a condition causing disability that is linked to or identical to a prior disability for which Monthly Benefits were paid. Key aspects include:

- A Recurrent Disability will be evaluated based on the original disability's definition and elimination period.
- The new disability must not improve within 180 days following the end of the elimination period, or it should continue beyond that period without improvement if there was no elimination period for the initial disability.
- If a Recurrent Disability occurs during the Benefit Period, Monthly Benefits will be reinstated from the first day of disability and continue through the remaining Benefit Period.
- If a Recurrent Disability happens after the Benefit Period has ended but before the end of the Maximum Period of Coverage, a new Benefit Period will commence from the date of disability, and Monthly Benefits will be paid for the remaining duration of the Maximum Period of Coverage.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, a Recurrent Disability is considered a new Disability if the Insured Employee returns to their Own Occupation with the Employer for six consecutive months or more following the end of prior Disability benefits, working at least the Minimum Number of Hours Per Week specified in the Schedule of Benefits. A new Elimination Period must be completed before further Monthly Benefits are payable. A new Maximum Benefit Period will apply. This means that if the same disability recurs and the conditions are met, a new period for benefit eligibility begins with fresh duration limits.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf detail (pages 25-26, rows 22 to 64, 4, 7, and 8) outlines the Recurrent Disability provision. If an Insured Employee returns to their Own Occupation with the employer on a full-time basis for less than six months after prior Disability benefits end, another Disability is considered recurrent. The same Maximum Benefit Period, Exclusions, and Limitations apply. No new Elimination Period is required before further Monthly Benefits are paid.

If the Insured Employee can't return to work with the employer due to lack of a job opening or policy termination, they might be eligible for reinstated benefits if they meet specific conditions: working full-time at another employer following the minimum hours per week in the Schedule of Benefits, not receiving benefits under any other group long-term disability plan, and having a recurrent Disability.

The Predisability Income used to determine prior Disability benefits applies for Recurrent Disabilities as well. To qualify for Monthly Benefits, an Insured Employee or former Employee must earn less than the specified percentage of Predisability Income stated in the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit section. All other Policy terms and conditions that applied to the prior Disability also apply to reinstated benefits. This provision no longer applies if an Insured Employee becomes eligible for coverage under any other group long-term disability plan.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf (page 26, rows 4-7), the effective date for an insured employee to receive Long Term Disability Benefits under this policy is subject to two scenarios:

Firstly, if the employee becomes eligible on the date specified in the Policy. This initial coverage commences, marking the start of their long term disability insurance.

Secondly, if the Progressive Income Benefit provision is added later via a Policy amendment, the effective date for this additional benefit will also be defined at that time. The specifics will depend on the amendment's terms and conditions.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, an Insured Employee's effective date for the benefit is delayed if they are unable to perform all Activities of Daily Living or suffer from a Cognitive Impairment on that date. The employee becomes insured once they can safely and independently perform these activities without active assistance, or when their cognitive impairment ceases.
<EOS>
Under the Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf policy, after fulfilling the Elimination Period outlined in the insurance schedule, the company will pay an extra monthly benefit to an Insured Employee who is already receiving Total Disability or Partial Disability Monthly Benefits, and can provide evidence of suffering from either Loss of Activities of Daily Living or a Cognitive Impairment (as defined within the policy). The proof must be submitted at the employee's own expense. This additional benefit applies only if such evidence is provided.
<EOS>
In the Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf document, the Progressive Income Benefit is outlined. This benefit equals 10% of the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings, but it will not surpass the Maximum Monthly Benefit for Long Term Disability Benefits or $5,000 per month (whichever is less). The Schedule of Insurance specifies the Maximum Monthly Benefit for Long Term Disability Benefits. This benefit is not affected by any Other Income Benefits nor earnings from any employment form.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, the Progressive Income Benefit will cease upon the earliest occurrence of any of the following events: the Insured Employee's recovery from Loss of Activities of Daily Living or Cognitive Impairment (as defined), termination of Total Disability or Partial Disability Monthly Benefits under the Policy, expiration of the Maximum Benefit Period, or the Insured Employee's death. Notably, if the policy includes a Family Income Benefit, the Eligible Surviving Spouse or Children will not receive increased payments due to the Insured Employee's receipt of this Progressive Income Benefit.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, a Loss of Activities of Daily Living claim arises when an insured employee experiences an injury or sickness leading to the inability to safely and completely perform at least two out of six essential daily tasks without significant assistance. These activities include bathing, continence, dressing, eating, toileting, and transferring (from a bed or chair) without help from another person for most of the activity. This loss must be permanent or expected to last more than 90 days. The policy applies to the specified employee as per their coverage.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, bathing encompasses washing oneself in a tub, shower, or via sponge bath, with or without equipment, as outlined on page 26 row 60.

According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, under the 'Cognitive Impairment' term, an Insured Employee must have experienced a permanent deterioration or loss of cognitive or intellectual capacity due to injury or sickness. This impairment necessitates another person's active, hands-on help or verbal cues to prevent self or others from harm. The diagnosis is based on clinical evidence and reliable standardized tests for short/long-term memory, orientation, and deductive reasoning. The impairment may stem from moderate to severe head trauma, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, or other irreversible dementia. Diagnosis requires a Physician's assessment.

The Company has the discretion to determine eligibility and the amount of any payable benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, an eligible employee must have a disability preventing regular occupation performance, followed by an inability to adapt to any other profitable occupation due to a lack of necessary skills or experience. The candidate must also be physically and mentally capable of completing the program, with a reasonable expectation of post-program return to work based on motivation and labor market demand for the proposed occupation. Lastly, the cost of the proposed services should be less than the Company's anticipated claim liability.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, page 30, row 37, if an insured employee receives Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit but fails to complete the program without good cause, this policy will not cover any disability during that period.

The Company determines what constitutes reasonable accommodations.
<EOS>
To receive the Benefit under Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf, the Employer must have an Insured Employee whose Disability prevents regular performance at the worksite, but with potential to perform the job or another with proposed accommodation. The employee should also be reasonably expected to return to work with said accommodation.

According to Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf on pages 34 and the subsequent rows, during the first 12 months following an insured employee's effective date, any disability that is either caused or worsened by a pre-existing condition (as defined within this provision) will not be covered under the Total Disability or Partial Disability benefits.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939762.pdf section on Prior Insurance Credit (rows 19-21, page 34) outlines a limitation under the Medical Premium Benefit provision.

Residents of North Carolina purchasing life, annuity, or health insurance should be aware that these companies are members of the North Carolina Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association (NC LHIGA).
