The Elimination Period: a. begins on the first day of Disability; and b. is satisfied when the required number of days is accumulated within a period which does not exceed two times the Elimination Period. During a period of Disability, the Insured Employee may return to full-time work, at his or her own or any other occupation, for an accumulated number of days not to exceed the Elimination Period. 2.

        "content": "GENERAL PROVISIONS ENTIRE CONTRACT .  The entire contract between the parties shall consist of: 1. the Policy and any amendments to it; 2. the Policyholder's application (a copy of which is attached to the Policy); 3. any Participating Employers' applications or Participation Agreements; and 4. any individual applications of the Insured Employees. In the absence of fraud, all statements made by the Policyholder and by Insured Employees are representations and not warranties.  No statement made by an Insured Employee will be used to contest the coverage provided by the Policy, unless: 1. it is contained in a written statement signed by that Insured Employee; and 2. a copy of the statement has been furnished to that Insured Employee. INCONTESTABILITY.   Except for the non-payment of premiums or fraud, the Company may not contest the validity of the Policy after it has been in force for two years from its date of issue; and as to any Insured Employee, after his or her coverage has been in force for two years during his or her lifetime.  This clause does not preclude, at any time, the assertion of defenses based upon: 1. the Policy's eligibility requirements, exclusions and limitations; and 2. other Policy provisions unrelated to the validity of coverage. RESCISSION .  The Company has the right to rescind any insurance for which Evidence of Insurability was required, if: 1. an Insured Employee incurs a claim during the first two years of coverage; and 2. the Company discovers that the Insured Employee made a Material Misrepresentation on his or her application. A  \"Material Misrepresentation\"  is an incomplete or untrue statement that caused the Company to issue coverage that it would have disapproved, had it known the truth.   \"To rescind\"  means to cancel insurance back to its effective date.  In that event, the Company will refund all premium paid for the rescinded insurance, less any benefits paid for the Insured Employee's claims.  The Company reserves the right to recover any claims paid in excess of such premiums. MISSTATEMENTS OF FACTS .  If relevant facts about any person were misstated: 1. a fair adjustment of the premium will be made; and 2. the true facts will decide if and in what amount insurance is valid under the Policy. If an Insured Employee's age has been misstated, any benefits shall be in the amount the paid premium would have purchased at the correct age. POLICYHOLDER'S AGENCY .  For all purposes of the Policy, the Policyholder acts on its own behalf or as the Employee's agent.  Under no circumstances will the Policyholder be deemed the Company's agent. CURRENCY .  In administering the Policy: 1. all Predisability Income will be expressed in U.S. dollars; and 2. all premium and benefit amounts must be paid in U.S. dollars. WORKERS' COMPENSATION OR STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE .  The Policy does not replace or provide benefits required by: 1. Workers' Compensation laws; or 2. any state disability insurance plan laws. ASSIGNMENT .  The rights and benefits under this Certificate may not be assigned.",

        "content": "DEFINITIONS (continued) RETIREMENT BENEFIT , when used with the term Retirement Plan, means a benefit that: 1. is payable under a Retirement Plan either in a lump sum or in the form of periodic payments; 2. does not represent contributions made by an Insured Employee (Payments representing Employee contributions are deemed to be received over the Insured Employee's expected remaining life, regardless of when they are actually received.); and 3. is payable upon: a. early or normal retirement; or b. disability (if the payment does reduce the benefit which would have been paid at the normal retirement age under the plan, if disability had not occurred). RETIREMENT PLAN  means a defined benefit or defined contribution plan that: 1. provides Retirement Benefits to Employees; and 2. is not funded wholly by Employee contributions. The term shall  not  include any 401(k), profit-sharing or thrift plan; informal salary continuance plan; individual retirement account (IRA); tax sheltered annuity (TSA); stock ownership plan; or a non-qualified plan of deferred compensation. An Employer's Retirement Plan is deemed to include any Retirement Plan: 1. which is part of any federal, state, county, municipal or association retirement system; and 2. for which the Insured Employee is eligible as a result of employment with the Employer. SICK LEAVE  or  SALARY CONTINUANCE PLAN  means a plan that: 1. is established and maintained by the Employer for the benefit of Employees; and 2. continues payment of all or part of an Insured Employee's Predisability Income for a specified period after he or she becomes Disabled. It does  not  include compensation the Employer pays an Insured Employee for work actually performed during a Disability. SICKNESS  means illness, pregnancy or disease. TOTAL COVERED PAYROLL  means the total amount of Basic Monthly Earnings for all Employees insured under the Policy. TOTAL DISABILITY or TOTALLY DISABLED  will be defined as follows. 1. During the Elimination Period and Own Occupation Period, it means that due to an Injury or Sickness the Insured Employee is unable to perform each of the Main Duties of his or her Own Occupation. 2. After the Own Occupation Period, it means that due to an Injury or Sickness the Insured Employee is unable to perform each of the Main Duties of any occupation which his or her training, education or experience will reasonably allow. The loss of a professional license, an occupational license or certification, or a driver's license for any reason does  not , by itself, constitute Total Disability. WAITING PERIOD  means the period of time an Employee must be employed in an eligible class with the Employer, before he or she becomes eligible to enroll for coverage under the Policy.  The period of service must be continuous, except as explained in the Eligibility provision captioned Prior Service Credit Towards Waiting Period.",
