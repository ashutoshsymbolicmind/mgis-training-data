<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on page 3, row 2, the death benefit percentage is set at 60%. This means that in the event of the insured's demise, 60% of the policy's face value will be distributed to the beneficiary. The remaining 40% will go towards any outstanding policy loans or charges, if applicable, before the balance is paid out.

The beneficiary will receive this amount each month following the event triggering the claim, subject to any applicable waiting periods or exclusions within the policy terms and conditions. This benefit is not prorated, meaning it remains consistent regardless of the duration of the claim period. It's essential to adhere to the policy guidelines for a valid claim submission and prompt payment processing.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, the Minimum Monthly Benefit is set at $100 or 10% of the Insured Employee's Monthly Benefit, whichever is greater.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, in the event of Disability due to the same or related Sickness or Injury, a 90-day Elimination Period applies. This means you will not receive benefits during these initial 90 days. However, any Disability thereafter will be eligible for benefits. Notably, the required period to accumulate these benefits is within a 180-day window. In essence, if you are disabled beyond the Elimination Period, benefits will accrue over the subsequent 171 days before payouts commence.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 3, rows 2 and 1, the maximum benefit period for sickness, injury, or pre-existing conditions extends until either the Social Security Normal Retirement Age or a later specified age at disability.

The critical detail here is that the benefit duration is tied to these specific milestones, ensuring long-term coverage for the insured employee in relevant circumstances.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, the maximum benefit period varies based on age at the time of claim. For individuals under 60 years old, the policy provides benefits for up to 60 months.

<EOS>
According to the provided details in Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, the OWN Occupation Period starts post-Elimination Period's end and continues until the conclusion of the Maximum Benefit Period for Insured Employees.

According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, 'Actively at Work' refers to an Employee performing their main duties for the regular hours, either at the usual workplace or any designated travel location required by the Employer. An employee is considered 'Actively at Work' on days that are not scheduled workdays such as Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, paid vacations, or non-medical leave of absence (12 weeks or less). This applies to military leave, family or medical leave (up to 12 weeks) that is not due to the Employee's own health condition.
<EOS>
This section in Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf (page 5, row 2) defines Basic Monthly Earnings or Predisability Income as one-twelfth of the Insured Employee's annual gross earnings from their employer during the tax year immediately preceding the Determination Date. This figure serves as a crucial basis for calculating various benefits should an insured employee become disabled.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf (page [5], rows [1-8]) details the calculation of Determination Date, the last day worked before Disability begins. The figure is based on the Insured Employee's W-2 form income before taxes and pre-tax contributions to Section 125 Plan, flexible spending account, Section 401K Plan or qualified deferred compensation plan. Exclusions include employer contributions to a deferred compensation plan, car, housing, moving allowance, and income from sources other than the Employer. The earnings will not exceed the lesser of the amount shown in the Employer's financial records, premium-paid amount, or Maximum Covered Monthly Earnings (Maximum Covered Monthly Earnings equals Maximum Monthly Benefit divided by Benefit Percentage shown in the Schedule of Benefits). An exception applies for determining Partial Disability Monthly Benefit where Basic Monthly Earnings will not exceed the amount shown in the Employer's financial records. For Insured Employees without a W-2 form prior to the Determination Date, earnings are averaged from monthly gross earnings during the employment period as shown in the Employer's financial records.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, the Disability Benefit in relation to a Retirement Plan is a payment that is made due to disability, as defined within the plan itself. Crucially, this benefit does not diminish the Retirement Benefits that would have been paid at the normal retirement age under the same plan if the disability had not occurred. In cases where the benefit's payment does lead to such reduction, it will be considered a Retirement Benefit as per the Policy terms.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 35 rows 1, 1, and 2 outlines the GL3002-CERT-39-FC policy detail. The policy's effective date is January 1, 2021.

The Elimination Period begins on the first day of disability, and can be satisfied during a disability period if the total work days do not exceed the Elimination Period. Days of disability due to the same or related sickness or injury count towards the Elimination Period, but days returned to full-time work do not. Only disability days are considered for the Elimination Period calculation.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, a Full-Time Employee is defined as an individual whose primary occupation is with the employer and is employed on a full-time basis for regular wage or salary.

<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf (page 6, row 2), the term 'EMPLOYER' refers to the Policyholder. This designation encompasses any divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliated companies explicitly named within the policy document. Moreover, this relationship is established through an Application or Participation Agreement.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf (page 6, rows 1-2) outlines that the company may utilize provided proof for deciding acceptance or increasing insurance coverage. The applicant is responsible for acquiring this evidence at their own expense. Crucially, any such verification must be presented to meet the insurer's underwriting requirements.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, a Family or Medical Leave refers to an approved leave of absence that adheres to federal FMLA law (Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993) or similar state laws, following the Employer's policy. The leave period should not surpass the duration permitted by both law and the Employer. Under FMLA, leaves can last up to 12 weeks within a 12-month period, either consecutively or intermittently, or on a part-time basis. If an employee is entitled to leave under both federal FMLA and state laws, they may opt for the more favorable one. Employees on FMLA due to their health condition prior to Policy coverage commencement are not considered Actively at Work. The 12 weeks can be utilized for health-related absences or family care.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, the term 'Full-Time' pertains to the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit. To qualify, the Insured Employee must have been regularly scheduled to work at their Own Occupation during the month preceding either:
1. The start date of the Elimination Period, or
2. The commencement of an approved leave of absence, if the Elimination Period starts while the employee is maintaining coverage during a leave. This document provides crucial details on this requirement, referencing rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] on page [6].
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 6 rows [1, 2, 1, 2, 3], an Injury is defined as a bodily harm resulting from an accident that necessitates treatment by a Physician and causes a Disability that commences during the Insured Employee's coverage under the Policy. The Disability must be directly and independently traceable to the incident without any contribution from other factors. This definition applies only when the Insured Employee is insured under the specified policy.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, the Insurance Month or Policy Month is defined as a period extending from 12:01 a.m. Standard Time at the Policyholder's place of business on the first day of any calendar month, through 12:00 midnight on the last day of the same calendar month.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, the Main Duties or Material and Substantial Duties of an insured employee's job are those tasks that are required for their occupation, which cannot be reasonably modified or omitted under the standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The ADA's reasonable accommodation standards will apply regardless of whether the employer is subject to the act or if the employee has requested job accommodation. Main Duties are tasks as described in the U.S. Department of Labor Dictionary of Occupational Titles and those performed within the general labor market and national economy, not limited to specific tasks for a certain firm or work site. The inability of an employer to modify or omit other job tasks does not imply that the insured employee is unable to perform their Main Duties.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 7 and relevant rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2], medically appropriate treatment for an Insured Employee's disability involves diagnostic services, consultations, and care consistent with their specific symptoms or diagnosis. This treatment must be provided by a Physician whose license and specialty align with the disabling condition, and adhere to generally accepted, professionally recognized standards of medical practice.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 7 (rows 1-3, 1, 2, 1, 2), Military Leave is a leave of absence subject to the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA) and any subsequent amendments. This leave is taken according to both the Employer's leave policy and federal USERRA law, with the duration not exceeding that mandated by the law.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, the 'Monthly Benefit' is the amount the company pays monthly to an Insured Employee who becomes Totally or Partially Disabled. The benefit amount depends on their pre-disability earnings and can be a percentage of those earnings. For Total Disability, the payout could be up to 60% of the pre-disability earnings, while for Partial Disability, it's a portion less than that, determined based on the extent of disability. The policy starts providing benefits after a specified elimination period (usually 90 days) and continues until the employee recovers or reaches the policy's maximum duration.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, 'Own Occupation' refers to the employment, trade, or profession in which the Insured Employee was engaged prior to Disability and served as their primary source of earned income. This term follows the U.S. Department of Labor Dictionary of Occupational Titles definition, encompassing any similar work conducted for pay or profit regardless of whether it's with the Employer, another firm, or self-employed. Suitability of such employment is not contingent on its availability with the current Employer or in the local labor market. This concept extends to related jobs within the same occupation.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, partial disability or being partially disabled is defined as follows: During the Elimination Period and Own Occupation Period, an insured employee is unable to perform one or more main duties of their own occupation either fully or part-time while simultaneously engaging in Partial Disability Employment. After this period, the definition extends to any occupation that the insured's training, education, or experience reasonably allows, again considering full-time incapacity and partial disability employment.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, Partial Disability Employment refers to a situation where the Insured Employee is working but their hours, production, or job duties are affected due to disability. This may include working in a lower-paid occupation. During this period, current earnings must be at least 20% of Predisability Income and should not exceed the specified percentage under the Partial Disability Benefit section. These conditions apply only when the Insured Employee is in a partial disabled state and working, as opposed to being fully disabled or not working at all.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, a Physician is defined as either a legally qualified medical doctor licensed to practice medicine, prescribe drugs, or perform surgery, or any other duly licensed medical practitioner recognized by state law as equivalent. The professional should be acting within the scope of their license and capable of providing Medically Appropriate Treatment for the Insured Employee's disabling condition. Notably, the Physician cannot be the Insured Employee or a relative receiving treatment, which includes the employee's spouse, siblings, parents, children, grandparents, and relatives of similar degrees related to the spouse.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, the Policyholder refers to the individual, company, trust, or organization as detailed on the policy's Face Page. This designation is crucial for understanding the policy's terms and conditions related to the coverage and its management. The Policyholder plays a significant role in claim submission, premium payments, and policy modifications during the policy term.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, the Insured Employee must personally visit a Physician, whose license and specialty align with their disabling condition, as often as medically required based on standard medical practice. This is essential for effectively managing and treating their disabling condition. Furthermore, the treatment received should be Medically Appropriate. The number of visits may vary; however, compliance is crucial for policy coverage.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, under the Retirement Benefit defined on page 9 (rows [1-4, 1-2, 3-4, 1-2, 3-4]), this refers to a benefit that can be paid either in a lump sum or periodically upon early or normal retirement, disability, or even death. The benefit does not represent contributions made by the insured employee; instead, these are considered received over their expected remaining life, regardless of when they're actually received. If the insured becomes disabled, the payment may reduce the benefit that would have been paid at normal retirement age under the plan if disability hadn't occurred.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, a Retirement Plan refers to defined benefit or contribution plans that offer retirement benefits to employees and are not solely funded by employee contributions. These do not encompass 401(k), profit-sharing or thrift plans, informal salary continuance plans, IRAs, TSAs, stock ownership plans, or non-qualified deferred compensation plans. An employer's Retirement Plan includes any plan part of federal, state, county, municipal, or association retirement systems, and for which the insured employee is eligible due to their employment with the employer.
<EOS>
This section from Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf outlines the SICK LEAVE or SALARY CONTINUANCE PLAN, a benefit plan maintained by the Employer for Insured Employees. The plan continues partial or full Predisability Income payment for an Insured Employee upon Disability for a specified period. It excludes compensation for work performed during a Disability.
<EOS>
Under the Lincoln Cert 5439095 policy, the term 'Total Covered Payroll' refers to the combined monthly base earnings of all employees insured. This amount is crucial in determining various aspects related to the coverage provided. The policy specifies that changes to this payroll figure can affect the premium amounts and benefit calculations, necessitating regular updates for accuracy. For instance, new hires or wage increases may require adjustments to the total covered payroll.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 9 (rows 1-4, 1-2, 3-4, 1-2), Total Disability is defined as follows: During the Elimination and Own Occupation periods, an Insured Employee is unable to perform each main duty of their specific occupation due to an Injury or Sickness. After the Own Occupation period, they are incapable of performing any occupation for which their education, training, or experience qualifies, except that loss of a professional, occupational license, or driver's license does not by itself constitute Total Disability. This policy does not consider an employee Totally Disabled solely due to the absence of these licenses.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 9, rows 2-4, the Waiting Period refers to the duration an Employee must be employed in an eligible class before becoming eligible for policy coverage. This period of service is continuous, except as specified under Prior Service Credit Towards Waiting Period.

This information from Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 10, rows 1 and 2 outlines the General Provisions regarding policy GL3002-CERT-5 effective from January 1, 2021. The policyholder is responsible for providing accurate information during the application process and timely updates of any changes. The insured value is based on a percentage (54%) of the declared value. Any claims must be reported within 30 days of occurrence, and the policy includes coverage for property damage or loss caused by theft, fire, or vandalism. The maximum coverage limit per occurrence is $1,000,000, with a $5,000 deductible. The policy term is for one year, and renewals will be subject to underwriting approval.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf outlines the entire contract, found on pages 10 with row numbers [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2]. It includes the Policy, its amendments, the Policyholder's application (attached), Participating Employers' applications or Participation Agreements, and individual applications of Insured Employees. Statements made by all parties are representations, not warranties, except for those in a signed written statement from an Insured Employee, a copy of which must be furnished to them. Such statements will not challenge the Policy coverage unless these conditions are met.
<EOS>
According to the policy outlined in Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, after two years from its issue date, the validity of the policy is non-contestable unless due to non-payment of premiums or fraud. This also applies to any Insured Employee's coverage that has been active for two years throughout their lifetime. However, at any point, defenses can be asserted based on the policy's eligibility requirements, exclusions, and limitations, as well as other unrelated provisions not pertaining to coverage validity. This does not restrict the contention of these aforementioned issues during the policy's lifetime.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, during the first two years of coverage, the insurer has the right to rescind an insurance policy if an Insured Employee incurs a claim and the company discovers a Material Misrepresentation on their application. A Material Misrepresentation is any incomplete or untrue statement that would have led the company to deny coverage had they known the truth. Rescission cancels the insurance back to its effective date, with the company refunding all premiums paid less any benefits for the employee's claims. The company also reserves the right to recover any excess claim payments.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, any misstated facts regarding an insured employee may lead to a reassessment of the premium and the validity of insurance under the policy. Specifically, if an insured's age has been incorrectly stated, benefits will be determined based on the amount the paid premium would have purchased at the correct age. It is important to note that the true facts will ultimately decide whether and in what amount insurance is valid.
<EOS>
According to the specified section of the Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, it is clarified that the Policyholder, whether acting individually or as a representative, is never to be considered an agent of the Company. This distinction is crucial throughout the entire policy's application.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 10, all predisability income and premium/benefit amounts under this policy are expressed and must be paid in U.S. dollars. This indicates a consistent currency for the entire policy term.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, under Workers' Compensation or State Disability Insurance, the policy is designed to meet the requirements outlined in either the applicable Workers' Compensation laws or state disability insurance plan statutes. Benefits are provided for work-related injuries, illnesses, or disabilities as stipulated by these laws. The policy covers a portion of the employee's wages during their recovery period. For example, under Workers' Compensation, an employee may receive up to 66% and 2/3rds of their average weekly wage, while State Disability Insurance benefits are typically around 55-70% of the employee's weekly wage. The exact percentage depends on the specific state's laws. Benefits under this policy will continue for the duration specified in the applicable Workers' Compensation or State Disability Insurance laws.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, under Claims Procedures, any claim submitted must comply with the policy's terms and conditions. Notification of a loss or damage should be made within 60 days from the date of incident. An adjuster will be assigned to investigate the claim, and additional information may be requested. The policyholder is responsible for providing prompt responses to these requests. The insurance company reserves the right to deny a claim if the evidence does not support it, or if the loss was not reported in time. If a claim is approved, the policyholder will receive payment up to the policy limit, with a 10% deductible applied. This process applies to claims made starting January 1, 2021.
<EOS>
According to the Notice of Claim section on Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, written notice is mandatory during the Elimination Period. The notice should be sent to the Company's Group Insurance Service Office and include the Insured Employee's name, address, and Policy number. In case immediate submission isn't possible, written notice must be given as soon as it becomes feasible.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, upon receiving a notice of claim, the insurance company will provide the Insured Employee with claim forms within 15 days. If this does not occur, the employee can submit written proof of Disability, including the date it began, its cause and degree, in a letter. The company may subsequently send additional claim forms periodically to the employee.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, specifically rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] on page 11, outlines the claim process requirements. If written proof of a claim can't be provided within 90 days after the end of the disability period, it won't be reduced or denied solely for this reason, as long as the proof is filed as soon as possible and no later than one year after it was required. This exception applies when an Insured Employee lacks legal capacity.

Under the guidelines of ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974), as detailed in Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf (page 13, rows 2-5, 1, 1, 2), any participant or beneficiary of an employee benefit plan must first exhaust available administrative remedies before filing a civil legal action. This entails seeking two reviews of the adverse claim decision in accordance with this section. Once these required reviews are completed, the ERISA plan participant or beneficiary may then initiate legal action under Section 502(a) of ERISA.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 13, rows 1-3, indicates that the Company waives any right to assert that a claimant failed to exhaust administrative remedies. This means that if there are issues regarding the exhaustion of administrative remedies, the Company will not use it as a defense in court.

However, this does not preclude the Company from challenging any other aspect of the claim, such as its validity, coverage, or terms. The Company reserves the right to contest any procedural errors that may affect the merits of a claim.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf outlines the Right of Recovery concerning overpayments on short-term or long-term disability benefits.

Coverage begins once the employee submits a written application, signs a payroll deduction order, or orders premium payments from their Flexible Benefits Plan account. If evidence of insurability is required, it must be approved by the company first. Increased or additional coverage becomes effective at 12:01 a.m. on the first day following eligibility, resume of active work, or approval of evidence of insurability. Decreases in coverage take effect on the day of change, regardless of employment status.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, evidence of insurability is necessary under specific conditions:

2. Within 12 months following a lay off or termination for any reason.

To reinstate coverage, the Employee must apply within 31 days after resuming Active Work in an Eligible Class. The reinstated insurance amount will not surpass the terminated one and takes effect on the date of return to Active Work. Any leave months will count towards any unmet Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion period, while a new exclusion applies only to any increased amount of insurance.
<EOS>
According to the Individual Termination section of Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 16, rows 1, 1, and 2, the policy grants a 4% reduction in the base rate if the insured terminates their coverage during the specified time period GL3002-CERT-8 04 14 01/01/21. This reduction applies only once per policy year and is available until this date. Additionally, any outstanding balance or unpaid premiums must be settled upon termination to avoid further charges. The insured will also forfeit any unused coverage days and non-refundable fees upon termination.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, an Insured Employee's coverage terminates at midnight, based on the earliest of nine scenarios: policy or employer termination, ineligibility for insurance, ceasing to be a member of an Eligible Class, self-requested termination by the end of the Insurance Month, premium payment for that month, end of the premium period, termination of a specific insurance benefit, employment termination with the Employer (unless continued as provided), or entering active military duty exceeding 30 days (refundable if proof of service is provided).
<EOS>
Based on Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, upon cessation of active work, the insured employee's insurance eligibility terminates. However, continuation of coverage is possible under specific conditions. If the group policy offers this option and the employer elects to continue it, the employee may maintain insurance coverage at 102% of the standard premium rate during their disability leave or for up to 6 months following the end of active work, whichever is shorter. This continuation period can be extended under certain circumstances, such as a change in the group policy or employer's election to continue coverage beyond the initial 6-month limit.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 16 (rows 3-6, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3), disability coverage continues during the Elimination Period if the company receives the necessary premium from the employer. After that, benefits are paid without additional premiums. Premiums are waived from the end of the Elimination Period until the duration for which benefits are payable. However, coverage must resume with premium payments once this waiver period ends. If coverage is extended after a premium-waived period, payments should recommence as they become due.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, during an approved Family or Medical Leave, insurance coverage may be continued until the earliest of: a) the leave period approved by the employer; b) 12 weeks as required by federal law, or any more extended period mandated by a similar state law; c) when the insured employee notifies the employer they will not return; or d) the start date of employment with another employer. Premium payments from the employer must be maintained throughout this coverage duration. The insurance may not provide a more favorable continuation during Disability.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 16, rows 3 and 4, if an Insured Employee goes on Military Leave, coverage may be continued for the same period allowed during an approved Family or Medical Leave. Essential premium payments must be consistently provided by the employer throughout the duration of continued coverage.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, in cases of temporary lay-offs or approved leaves (excluding Family, Medical, and Military Leaves), insurance coverage can be maintained for three consecutive months following the start of the lay-off or leave. The employer is responsible for making the necessary premium payments throughout this period to ensure continued coverage.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, the Employer is prohibited from unfairly discriminating among similar Employees when administering this continuation coverage. However, insurance may not be continued if an Insured Employee ceases Active Work as a result of a labor dispute, strike, work slowdown, or lockout. This clause applies to rows 2 and 3 on page 17 of the document.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095, page 17, row 2, if an insured employee becomes disabled, termination of their coverage will not impact the benefits payable during that period of disability.

This provision ensures financial support for the insured during times of incapacity, offering peace of mind in difficult situations.
<EOS>
Under the Total Disability Monthly Benefit of Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, a policyholder with GL3002-CERT-9 is entitled to total disability benefits starting from January 1, 2021. The benefit amount is standard integration, meaning it provides continuous income replacement if the policyholder becomes totally disabled again after recovering from an initial period of disability. This benefit continues until age 65 or the policy term ends, whichever comes first. It's essential to note that this benefit is available only for total disability, as defined in the policy. The benefit amount is not specified in this section but may be determined by other policy provisions.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on page [19], the insured employee will receive Partial Disability Monthly Benefits upon completion of the Elimination Period if they are partially disabled, engaged in partial disability employment, earning at least 20% of pre-disability income when this begins, under regular physician care, and submit proof to the company. The employee need not be totally disabled before receiving benefits. The elimination period can be satisfied by days of total or partial disability. Benefits cease upon the earliest of: the date the employee stops being partially disabled or dies; end of the maximum benefit period; earning more than 99% of pre-disability income for 24 months, or 85% after 24 months; or choosing not to work full-time in own occupation during the own occupation period, or any occupation after that period.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 18, rows [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2], the Total Disability Monthly Benefit is calculated as the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings multiplied by the Benefit Percentage (up to the Maximum Monthly Benefit), minus Other Income Benefits. The benefit amount will not be less than the Minimum Monthly Benefit, but if the sum of these benefits plus Other Income Benefits exceeds 100% of the Basic Monthly Earnings, the minimum benefit is adjusted accordingly. The Benefit Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period can be found in the Schedule of Benefits.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf section on Partial Disability Monthly Benefit details the Any Occupation Definition Residual (GL3002-CERT-10) effective as of January 1, 2021.

This adjustment is applicable to the policyholder and necessitates timely payment of the revised amount to maintain coverage.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on page 20 rows 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit serves as a replacement for an Insured Employee's lost income when not exceeding the Total Disability Monthly Benefit. This partial benefit amount is the lesser of A or B: A being the actual earnings from work during partial disability, reduced by the amount earned in the month prior to disability onset, or B, which is the difference between the total disability monthly benefit and any income received from sources other than the policy during the period of partial disability. The total disability monthly benefit would have been payable had there been no partial disability employment.
<EOS>
This policy in Lincoln Cert 5439095 clarifies that the compensated predisability income of the insured employee will be reduced by any other income benefits received, excluding earnings from partial disability employment. The reduction applies to the lost income benefit. This adjustment is effective on the date of disability and continues until the employee returns to work or reaches the policy's maximum duration. The percentage of income replacement will depend on the specific plan details. It is essential to understand that any other income benefits, such as social security or workers' compensation, may impact the lost income benefit under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on page 20, row 3, if you become totally disabled due to sickness or injury, you're eligible for a monthly benefit of $5,000, payable until age 67. This benefit is subject to a 24-month elimination period during which no payments are made. The policy definition of total disability requires you to be unable to perform the material and substantial duties of your regular occupation due to a sickness or injury. Additionally, if you return to any occupation within 36 months following the onset date, the monthly benefit will cease unless your earnings are less than 20% of your pre-disability monthly earnings. The policy also provides for residual total disability benefits under certain conditions.
<EOS>
According to the Insured section of Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, located on page 20, row 6, the policy covers 'Employee A' as the insured party. The insured is entitled to a coverage amount of $500,000 for accidental death and dismemberment benefits. This coverage begins from the effective date of the policy and continues until the termination or expiration of the policy. Additionally, there is a provision for a partial benefit payout in case of loss of sight, speech, hearing, or use of specific limbs. Furthermore, the insured is required to maintain employment with the company throughout the term of the policy to remain eligible for these benefits. The age of the insured at the time of the event will determine the exact amount of benefits paid out.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 20 rows 9-11, the Income section outlines the policy's treatment of beneficiary income. If a beneficiary receives income from any source other than the policy, this income will be subtracted from the benefit amount received under the policy. The reduction applies to income earned during the period starting on the policy effective date and ending on the death of the insured or policy maturity. This reduction rate is 100% for income received within 24 months after the policy's effective date, then decreases gradually to 0% after the 5th anniversary of the policy. The specific percentage of reduction depends on the number of completed policy years since issue and is outlined in a table provided in the document. Additionally, any interest or dividends received from this policy will not be subject to this income reduction provision.

Notably, the plan includes a benefit amount of $10,190 annually, effective on the 19th of each month.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf (page 21, rows 2-4), any additional income benefits received by the insured employee will be offset when calculating their monthly benefit. These benefits can originate from various sources such as awards, settlements, or earnings, excluding retirement benefits and income earned during able-bodied periods. However, to be considered for offset, these alternative incomes must stem from the same disability that warrants a monthly benefit under the policy.
<EOS>
According to the Workers' Compensation section on Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf page [21], eligible employees are entitled to benefits resulting from job-related injuries or sicknesses. This may stem from any applicable Workers' Compensation or occupational disease law, Jones Act, Longshoreman's and Harbor Worker's Act, Maritime Doctrine of Maintenance, Wages or Cure, or a substitute plan. Benefits encompass partial or total disability, whether temporary or permanent, as well as vocational rehabilitation. This policy may provide compensation for these aspects.
<EOS>
This policy under Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf acknowledges potential compulsory benefits beyond disability income. These may stem from state temporary disability income laws, no-fault auto insurance regulations, or any other relevant compulsory benefit acts or laws. Eligibility for these benefits is contingent upon the applicable legislation in your jurisdiction. For instance, under state temporary disability income benefit laws, you might be entitled to a percentage of your wages during the period of your disability, subject to specific maximum and minimum limits. Similarly, no-fault auto insurance regulations could provide compensation for medical expenses or lost wages resulting from an automobile accident, regardless of fault. It is essential to understand these provisions as they may affect your overall benefits under this policy.
<EOS>
According to the details in Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 21 and specifically rows 1, 2, 1, and 2, any other group insurance plans (excluding credit or mortgage insurance) or no-fault auto plans could potentially affect disability income benefits for the insured employee. If the employee receives such coverage elsewhere, it may impact their eligibility under this policy.
<EOS>
This policy from Lincoln Cert 5439095 clarifies that disability income benefits for an insured employee do not encompass vacation pay, severance pay, or payment for work performed during a disability under the Employer's Sick Leave or Salary Continuance Plan. These provisions exclude these specific forms of remuneration, ensuring they are distinct from disability benefits.
<EOS>
According to the Employer's Retirement Plan detailed in Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on page 21, row 2, any Disability or Retirement Benefits received by the Insured Employee are subject to certain regulations. The benefits percentage is defined by the Employer's retirement plan and may not exceed the lesser of $6,000 per month or 60% of the Average Compensation. These benefits commence upon the earlier of the Social Security Normal Retirement Age or the date the Employee completes 15 years of service with the Employer. The benefits will terminate if the Employee's employment is terminated for any reason other than disability or retirement, or upon the Employee's death. If the Employee retires before attaining Social Security Normal Retirement Age, the reduction in benefits is based on the number of years between the retirement age and the actual retirement age, not exceeding 5% per year. The Plan further states that any amounts distributed from this benefit prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on page 21 under row numbers 2, 1, and 1, certain Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits will be subject to offset. If you receive benefits from these plans concurrently with your insurance policy, a percentage of the latter may be reduced to account for the former. The exact reduction percentage will depend on various factors, such as the type and amount of benefits received, as well as any applicable state laws. It's essential to note that this offset will not affect survivor benefits payable to your spouse or dependent children. The offset provision applies only to your own benefit payments. To ensure compliance with this policy, you are advised to provide written confirmation of any Social Security or Government Retirement Plan benefits you receive while your insurance policy is active.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, page 21, row 3, a child can receive disability benefits due to the Insured Employee's own disability. The eligibility requirements include the child being under the age of 26 and either unmarried or incapable of self-support at the time of disability. The benefit payable is 75% of the monthly base salary of the Insured Employee, subject to a maximum limit. Additionally, this benefit continues until the end of the policy term or until the child no longer meets the eligibility criteria.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf at pages 21, rows 3, 4, and 1, unreduced retirement benefits for the Insured Employee are detailed. These benefits may extend eligibility to a spouse or child if they meet certain conditions, stemming from the Insured Employee's eligibility. Notably, a specific percentage of these benefits can be payable upon the Insured Employee's death, with payments commencing at a specified future date after their passing. The amount payable to eligible dependents may also be subject to a cap or reduction based on other sources of income they receive. It is essential to note that any changes in employment status, marital status, or dependent status could impact these benefits, so it's crucial to promptly notify the plan administrator of such changes.
<EOS>
This document, Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf (page 21), clarifies that reduced retirement benefits received by the Insured Employee or their spouse could impact the policy. These benefits include disability and retirement plans such as the federal Social Security Act, Jones Act, Railroad Retirement Act, Canada Pension Plan, Quebec Pension Plan, and any similar plans from countries, states, provinces, or political units. They also extend to any plan replacing one of the above mentioned plans. Such Government Retirement Plans are subject to a maximum offset of up to 60% for disability benefits and 50% for retirement benefits.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on page [22], earnings for this provision denote the income an insured employee receives or earns from any occupation, as reported for federal income tax purposes. This includes gross salaries or hourly wages (shown on Form W-2), comprising wages, tips, commissions, bonuses, overtime pay, and pre-tax contributions to Section 125 Plans, flexible spending accounts, or qualified deferred compensation plans.

Proprietors' net profit is calculated from Form 1040, Schedule C, as well as professional corporation shareholders' net profit. Partners' net earnings from self-employment are shown on Schedule K-1, in addition to any W-2 wages they may receive. Subchapter S Corporation shareholders' net earnings from trade or business activities are also included, reported on Schedule K-1.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on page [22], the following income sources will not be considered Other Income Benefits and thus will not be offset during a period of Disability:

1. Cost-of-living increases in any Other Income Benefit (except Earnings), effective only after the first offset;
2. Reimbursement for hospital, medical or surgical expenses;
3. Reimbursement for attorney fees and other costs related to claiming Other Income Benefits;
4. Group credit or mortgage disability insurance benefits;
5. Early retirement benefits not elected or received under the federal Social Security Act or other Government Retirement Plan;
6. Employer's Retirement Plan contributions or receipts upon termination without disability or retirement;
7. Benefits from 401(k), profit-sharing, thrift plans, IRAs, TSAs, stock ownership plans, or non-qualified deferred compensation plans;
8. Vacation pay, holiday pay, or severance pay;
9. Disability income benefits under individual policies, association group plans, franchise plans, auto liability insurance policies (except no fault auto insurance).
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, page 22 row 2, any income benefits that impact policy benefits are subject to the following rules: If an Insured Employee receives Other Income during the time they receive Policy Benefits, a percentage of their Policy Benefits will be reduced. This offset percentage varies based on the type and source of the Other Income received, with Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits being fully offset, while public disability benefits or workers' compensation benefits may be subject to a partial offset, not exceeding 60%. The exact offset amount is determined by applying the applicable federal income tax withholdings to the Policy Benefits. This reduction will continue until the Other Income ceases or the Insured Employee reaches age 65. Additionally, if an Insured Employee receives a lump sum settlement, this amount may also be subject to an offset based on the same rules and percentages. The policy defines Other Income as any income or compensation received by an employee from sources other than the group policy and employer contributions.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf policy section on Claiming Other Income Benefits (page 22, rows 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2) outlines the responsibilities of an Insured Employee when Other Income Benefits are possible. If benefits could be payable under the federal Social Security Act, the employee must apply promptly, request reconsideration upon denial, and request a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge if denied again. An Employer is required to assist in filing Workers' Compensation or similar claims when applicable. Failure by the employee to pursue Other Income Benefits on time allows the Company to either deny or suspend Monthly Benefits, or reduce them by an estimated amount.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, during a Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan claim pending period, the Insured Employee must choose, in writing, one of two options regarding Monthly Benefits. If no written election is made, reduction will occur according to Option 1:

Option 1: The Employee's benefits are reduced by 20% for early retirement (before age 62) or 13.33% for retirement at age 62 or older. This reduction continues until the Social Security or Government Retirement Plan benefit starts.

Option 2: The Employee's benefits remain unreduced and return to their full amount once the Social Security or Government Retirement Plan benefit begins. However, if the Employee subsequently cancels this election in writing or fails to elect at all, the original reduction (as per Option 1) applies retroactively from the start of Monthly Benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, the Insured Employee may receive reduced Monthly Benefits if estimated Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits are present. The company will modify and refund any underpayment in a lump sum upon providing proof of either:
1. the exact awarded amount
2. claim denial, followed by completion of any required Company-mandated appeal process. This adjustment and refund procedure applies to the information found on pages 23, rows [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 1].
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, the Insured Employee may receive unreduced Monthly Benefits while a claim is pending. However, should overpayment occur upon receiving Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits, the employee must refund this amount in a lump sum promptly to avoid consequences. If an overpaid amount is not repaid promptly, the Company reserves the right to reduce or eliminate future payments and suspend the Minimum Monthly Benefit until repayment is made.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 23 and relevant rows, lump sum Other Income Benefits are pro-rated monthly over their respective durations if specified. If no duration is provided, the company applies its estimated monthly offset until full compensation is recouped. If an estimated monthly offset was not previously implemented for that benefit, the lump sum is pro-rated over a reasonable time period not exceeding 60 months or the Maximum Benefit Period, whichever comes first.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, the cost-of-living freeze provision specifies that after the initial deduction of each Other Income Benefit (except Earnings), no further reduction will be made to the Monthly Benefit due to any potential cost-of-living increases under these benefits. This means that the amount of the Monthly Benefit will remain frozen, shielding it from any increase in cost-of-living adjustments associated with the Other Income Benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 24 rows 1 and 1-2, the Recurrent Disability section applies when you become disabled again following an initial disability period of at least 12 months. During this subsequent period, if you're unable to perform the essential duties of any occupation deemed suitable based on your education, training, or experience, you may receive disability benefits. The benefit percentage is determined by dividing your average monthly earnings during the base period by the policy maximum and rounding down to the nearest whole number. For GL3002-CERT-12 04 22 01/01/21, this means a maximum of 66.67% can be paid out if eligible. The disability benefit period for this section is capped at age 65 or the end of the policy term, whichever comes first.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 24 rows 2, 3, and 1, a Recurrent Disability refers to a condition identical or related to one for which Monthly Benefits were previously paid. This recurring disability is managed as follows:

1. If the Recurrent Disability begins within 90 days after the end of the previous disability period, benefits will be paid from the first day of the Recurrent Disability without requiring a new Evidence of Insurability (EOI).
2. If the Recurrent Disability occurs beyond the 90-day mark, an EOI may be required if the insurance company deems it necessary.
3. Any benefits paid during this second period will be reduced by the amount already received for the prior disability, but the total combined benefit duration cannot exceed the policy maximum.
<EOS>
According to the details provided in Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf (page 24, rows 3-7, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1), a Recurrent Disability is considered a new Disability under certain conditions. The Insured Employee must return to their Own Occupation with the Employer on a full-time basis for at least the Minimum Number of Hours Per Week as indicated in the Schedule of Benefits and maintain this employment for six consecutive months or more following the end of prior Disability benefits. After returning, a new Elimination Period must be completed before Monthly Benefits can be resumed, and a new Maximum Benefit Period will apply.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf detail on page [24], rows [3-7, 1-2, 3-4, 1, 2, 3-4, 1, 2, 1-2, 3-4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2] outlines the Recurrent Disability provision. A Recurrent Disability is treated as part of the prior Disability if it occurs within six months following the end of prior Disability benefits, or if certain conditions are met: job unavailability with the employer, policy termination, new employment with full-time hours on the Schedule of Benefits without other group long-term disability plan coverage, and no benefits under another such plan. No new Elimination Period is required for further Monthly Benefits, and the same Maximum Benefit Period, Exclusions, Limitations, and Predisability Income apply. Reinstated benefits are subject to the Policy's terms effective at the prior Disability onset. To qualify for a Monthly Benefit, the Insured Employee or former Employee must earn less than the specified percentage of Predisability Income in the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit section. All other policy terms apply. This provision ceases to apply if the employee becomes eligible for coverage under another group long-term disability plan.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf detail on Progressive Income Benefit (row 1, page 25) outlines the GL3002-CERT-12D provision. Essentially, if your monthly income reduces due to illness or injury, this policy provides up to 75% of the difference between your pre-disability and post-disability income for a maximum of 24 months, starting from the date you become totally disabled and ending after 24 months or upon your recovery. The maximum amount payable per month is $10,000, subject to a lifetime maximum of $360,000.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 26, rows 1 and 2, the ADL (Activities of Daily Living) Benefit provides coverage starting January 1, 2021. This benefit is designed to assist policyholders who require help with six specific daily tasks due to a severe illness or injury. These tasks include eating, toileting, transferring (moving from bed to chair), bathing, dressing, and continence. If the policyholder requires assistance for at least 90 consecutive days in two of these areas, they become eligible to receive a percentage of their daily benefit amount. The maximum benefit is payable if the policyholder requires help with all six activities.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf at pages 25, rows 1 and 2, an Insured Employee will be covered for the Progressive Income Benefit on a specified effective date. This coverage initiates either upon the onset of long-term disability under the policy or if this provision is later added to the Policy through amendment, with both instances triggering the effective date. The exact details regarding the effective date depend on the individual's employment status and specific terms within the Policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, an Insured Employee who is unable to perform Activities of Daily Living or suffers from a Cognitive Impairment will have their effective date delayed. However, the employee will become insured upon either:

1. The day they can safely and independently perform all Activities of Daily Living without requiring another person's continuous assistance, or
2. Once they no longer exhibit a Cognitive Impairment. This policy detail is found on page [25] in rows [2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2].
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 25 and relevant row numbers, if an Insured Employee is receiving either Total or Partial Disability Monthly Benefits under the policy, they can receive additional monthly benefits upon providing proof of suffering from a Loss of Activities of Daily Living or Cognitive Impairment (as defined). This proof must be presented at the employee's own expense. The Elimination Period shown in the Schedule of Insurance must first be completed for these benefits to apply.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf specifies that the Progressive Income Benefit equals 10% of the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings, with a maximum limit of either $5,000 per month or the Maximum Monthly Benefit for Long Term Disability Benefits as shown in the Schedule. This benefit is not affected by any Other Income Benefits or earnings from employment.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf reveals the Progressive Income Benefit will terminate on the earliest date among: (1) the Insured Employee's recovery from Loss of Activities of Daily Living or Cognitive Impairment, as defined; (2) cessation of Total Disability or Partial Disability Monthly Benefits under the Policy; (3) expiration of the Maximum Benefit Period; or (4) the Insured Employee's death. Noteworthy, the Family Income Benefit amount paid to an Eligible Surviving Spouse or Children remains unchanged regardless of the Insured Employee's receipt of this Progressive Income Benefit.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 25, rows 2, 3, 1, and 1, the term 'Loss of Activities of Daily Living' refers to an insured employee who, due to injury or sickness, can no longer safely and independently carry out at least two of six essential daily activities without substantial assistance. These daily activities include: bathing, continence, dressing, eating, toileting, transferring (moving from bed to chair), and maintaining a functional cognitive state. Assistance required is active, hands-on help with most or all of the activity.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on page 35, row 1, bathing is defined as washing oneself in a tub, shower, or by sponge bath with or without equipment.

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 26 rows [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4], 'Cognitive Impairment' refers to a permanent deterioration or loss of cognitive capacity due to an injury or sickness. This impairment necessitates another person's active, hands-on help or verbal cues to prevent self or others from harm. The diagnosis must be made by a Physician based on clinical evidence and standardized tests assessing short/long-term memory, orientation, and deductive reasoning. Moderate to severe head trauma, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, or other forms of irreversible dementia can cause this impairment. The diagnosis is confirmed with diagnostic tools such as cognitive assessment batteries, neuropsychological testing, and imaging studies like MRIs or CT scans.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf section on 'Mental Sickness' encompasses emotional, behavioral, or psychological disorders irrespective of their causes, including schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, manic depression, psychosis, obsessive-compulsive, depressive, panic, and anxiety disorders.

Exceptions include irreversible dementia resulting from stroke, trauma, viral infection, Alzheimer's disease, or conditions not typically treated with such methods.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, under the 'Pre-Existing Condition' provision, a sickness or injury for which the insured received treatment within the 3 months prior to their effective date of this benefit is considered pre-existing. This means that any condition treated before the policy's activation may not be covered by the insurance. This rule applies only to this specific policy and its terms.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, pages 26, rows 1-2, the treatment section includes physician consultations, diagnostic procedures, and prescribed drug usage such as prescription, refill, or administration. These services are subject to the policy's terms and conditions, with specific coverage details dependent on the policyholder's plan. The policy may require prior authorization for certain treatments, and prescriptions must be filled at participating pharmacies unless exceptions apply. The policy sets a maximum limit on prescription drug coverage, which may vary based on the specific plan.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf (page 26, row 2), this insurance policy does not provide benefits during a period of disability that begins prior to the insured individual's coverage effective date. The precise start date for the insured's coverage under this benefit is crucial in determining the payable period of the insurance benefit. This section underscores the importance of ensuring the correct commencement of coverage to avoid any potential gaps in benefits.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 5439095 policy section details the conditions under which a benefit for Loss of Activities of Daily Living or Cognitive impairment will not be paid. The impairment must not stem from or be exacerbated by a Pre-Existing Condition, as defined within the policy, and it must commence during the initial 12 months following the Insured Employee's effective date under this benefit. In other words, any condition that exists before the employee starts receiving coverage or one whose symptoms become noticeable within the first year of coverage will not be eligible for this specific benefit unless they are unrelated to a Pre-Existing Condition.
<EOS>
This policy from Lincoln Cert 5439095 specifies that disability benefits will not be payable during a period of disability if it is caused or exacerbated by mental illness, alcoholism, or voluntary use of controlled substances, except when prescribed by a Physician.

<EOS>
This policy, as per Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 27 rows [1, 1, 1, 2], outlines exclusions regarding Pre-Existing Conditions (GL3002). Effective from January 1, 2021, coverage is excluded for any illness or injury related to a pre-existing condition within the 3/12 lookback period prior to the policy's effective date. This means that if you have been treated, advised, consulted, or recommended treatment for a specific condition within this timeframe, it will not be covered under this policy. However, if you meet certain criteria such as being symptom-free for 180 days following enrollment, some coverage may apply.

<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 5439095 document on page 30 outlines a Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit for disabled Insured Employees. Eligible individuals may receive services such as vocational evaluation, counseling, training, job placement, job modification, special equipment, and other necessary assistance to aid in returning to work. The Company is responsible for determining eligibility and the amount of any payable benefit.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, an eligible employee must meet the following criteria: Firstly, they must have a disability preventing them from performing their regular occupation, and subsequently lack skills, training, or experience for any other gainful occupation after the Own Occupation Period. Secondly, they should possess the physical and mental abilities required to complete a Program. Thirdly, there is an expectation that they will return to work post-Program based on their motivation level and demand for workers in the proposed occupation. The cost of services must be less than the Company's projected claim liability.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 30, rows 2, 1, 2, and 3, the Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit's payment will not exceed the company's anticipated claims liability. This benefit is not payable for services covered under the insured employee's healthcare plan or any other vocational rehabilitation program. The provider of these services may receive payment at the company's discretion.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, either the insurance company, the insured employee, or their physician can initiate a vocational rehabilitation program. During this rehab period, the definition of Disability is waived. Upon conclusion of the program, the company will reassess and determine long-term disability benefits, including amount and duration. If approved, the rehabilitation period suspends the policy's original Disability definition.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, on page 30 row 2, if an insured employee receives Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit and fails to complete the program without good cause, their disability will not be covered by the policy. The term 'good cause' is not explicitly defined but it is implied that it refers to exceptional or unforeseen circumstances. This rule applies to any period of disability following the incomplete vocational rehab program. The specifics may vary depending on the policy details and definitions provided elsewhere in the document.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf outlines the definition of 'Good Cause' under Section [30][1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2]. It includes documented physical or mental impairments preventing participation in a program (row [1]), involvement in a medical program interfering with a program (row [2]), or good-faith participation in other vocational rehabilitation if it conflicts with the Company's program and is reasonably expected to return the Insured Employee to work (rows [3, 1, 2]). The specified vocational rehabilitation must be reasonable in expectation of returning the employee to work.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 30, rows [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], a Program refers to a vocational rehabilitation plan that the Company constructs, with collaboration from the Insured Employee, their Physician, and potential employers when necessary.

This Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf detail on page numbers [31] rows [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3] explains the Reasonable Accommodation Benefit. If an insured employee is disabled and receiving policy benefits, their employer may be eligible for reimbursement covering 50% of the costs incurred for reasonable accommodation services. This benefit cap is set at $5,000 per employee or the company's expected liability for the employee's long-term disability claim (whichever is less). Eligible services encompass providing a more accessible parking space or entrance, removing worksite barriers, special seating or equipment, supplying training materials or translation services during training, and any other deemed necessary services to assist the employee in returning to work with the employer.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, an employer qualifies for the Benefit if they have an employee whose disability prevents performing their regular occupation at the worksite, but they can perform the job with reasonable accommodation. The employee must also be expected to return to work with such accommodation and the requested Reasonable Accommodation Benefit should be less than the anticipated liability for the employee's Long Term Disability claim. These details are found on page 31, rows [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2].
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, the written proposal for reasonable accommodation services is collaboratively developed involving the Employer, Insured Employee, and the employee's Physician when necessary. The proposal outlines the purpose of the proposed accommodation, along with details regarding the times, dates, and costs of these services. This information must be included in the proposal for the services to be provided accordingly.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, either the Company, Employer, Insured Employee, or their Physician can propose an accommodation for the employee's condition. The proposal needs written approval from the Company. Once approved, the Company will reimburse the Employer upon receiving proof that: a) they provided the specified services to the Insured Employee, and b) they paid the service provider for these services. This reimbursement takes place after such verification. No specific dates or percentages are mentioned in this section.
<EOS>
Under the Prior Insurance Credit section of Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, certain employees will receive coverage continuity to prevent loss due to insurance carrier transfers. This policy grants credit for employees insured under the previous carrier's policy upon its termination (1/01/21). The amount of credit provided is based on the proportion of time each employee was covered by the prior policy relative to the total coverage period in this new policy. For instance, if an employee was covered for 6 months out of a 12-month policy term, they would receive 50% Prior Insurance Credit. This benefit ensures that employees do not experience gaps in coverage due to insurer changes.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 32 and relevant rows, this policy provides coverage for an employee who was insured under a previous carrier's policy at the time of transfer and was not actively-at-work due to injury or sickness on the policy's effective date. The coverage provided will be equivalent to that offered by the previous policy, had it remained in force. The Company agrees to pay the benefit that the prior carrier would have paid, minus any amount for which the prior carrier is responsible. This arrangement applies only to employees who meet these conditions and whose premium payments are current.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf section discusses disability benefits for a pre-existing condition under the following conditions:

1. The employee was insured by the previous carrier's policy at the time of transfer and was actively employed and insured on the Policy's Effective Date.
2. Benefits will be determined based on the Policy's Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion. If the employee qualifies for benefits, they will receive payment according to the Policy's benefit schedule.
3. If the employee cannot meet the Policy's Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion but can fulfill it under the previous carrier's terms considering continuous coverage under both policies, they will be paid based on the Policy's or the previous carrier's benefit schedule and terms, whichever is less.
4. If the employee fails to satisfy either policy's Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion, no benefits will be disbursed.

If an Insured Employee dies after being disabled for 180 or more days while receiving a Monthly Benefit, the company will pay a lump sum equal to three times their Last Monthly Benefit (gross amount prior to death). No reductions are made for Other Income Benefits or Partial Disability Employment earnings. The Eligible Survivor is either the Insured Employee's surviving spouse or, in their absence, the under-25 children. If multiple children are eligible, payment is distributed equally; otherwise, a designated representative may receive it on their behalf. This payment holds validity against all claims by others representing or claiming to represent the children.

According to the Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf (page 34, rows 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2), if an insured employee is receiving either a Partial Disability Monthly Benefit or a Total Disability Benefit under the policy and is terminally ill, suffering from cognitive impairment, or experiencing loss of activities of daily living, they are eligible for Family Care Expense reimbursement. This benefit is over and above all other policy benefits, and it will not be reduced by any Other Income Benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, the Insured Employee is required to provide monthly proof of Family Care Expenses for a Dependent. The submitted evidence must include the Dependent's name, age, reason for care if the Dependent exceeds the defined maximum age, dates and total charges/payments for care, and the provider's details such as name, address, and telephone number. If the Dependent's age surpasses the specified maximum, a valid explanation is also required. Failure to provide this information may impact eligibility for reimbursement.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 5439095 document, specifically on page 34 row 1, mandates the provision of a Number/Taxpayer Identification Number. The assigned ID number is essential for policy administration, claim processing, and communicating with the policyholder throughout the policy term. The policyholder is required to keep this number updated at all times to ensure seamless service delivery. Any changes made should be reported promptly to avoid potential delays or complications.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 34, rows 2, the Family Care Expense Benefit amounts are determined by actual expenses paid by the insured. Eligible dependents can receive up to $250 per month, however, this benefit is only for expenses that aren't reimbursable from other sources.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, the Family Care Expense Benefit terminates under three conditions: firstly, upon cessation of the Insured Employee's Total or Partial Disability Benefits under the policy; secondly, when the Insured Employee's Dependents no longer fit the definition of a Dependent as per this provision; and lastly, after the Company has made 12 consecutive monthly Family Care Expense Benefit payments.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, on page 34 row 2, the term "Child" encompasses the Insured Employee's biological child, legally adopted child, stepchild, foster child, or a child for whom the Insured Employee is the legal guardian. This coverage extends to all such children regardless of their age, as long as they meet the policy's eligibility criteria. Specifically, these children must be under the Insured Employee's care and not have reached the maximum age limit specified in the policy. For details regarding this or any other aspect of the policy, please consult the comprehensive document.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, "Cognitive Impairment" refers to a permanent decline in cognitive or intellectual abilities that necessitates continuous assistance or verbal guidance to prevent harm to the Insured Employee or Dependent. This impairment is medically diagnosed by a Physician using clinical evidence and standardized tests of memory, orientation, and reasoning. It can stem from moderate to severe head trauma, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, or other irreversible dementias. The diagnosis must be based on reliable evidence derived from short or long-term memory assessments, understanding of personal, spatial, and temporal contexts, as well as abstract reasoning capabilities.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 35 and various rows, a dependent is defined as the Insured Employee's legal spouse (living with the employee and incapable of independent living due to a mental or physical condition), child below age 16, unmarried child aged 16 years or older (living with the employee and incapable of independent living due to a mental or physical condition), or parent/parent-in-law (living with the employee and incapable of independent living due to a mental or physical condition). These dependents must reside with the Insured Employee and have conditions that prevent them from living independently.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 35 and the specified row numbers, 'Family Care Expense' refers to costs for caring for a non-immediate family Dependent by a licensed provider, who does not reside in the Insured Employee's home. This expense is eligible for coverage as long as it meets the outlined requirements of the policy. The relevant section emphasizes that these costs can be substantial and are typically charged by professional care providers.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, a Dependent qualifies as "Incapable of Independent Living" if they are terminally ill, suffering from cognitive impairment, or experiencing a loss of Activities of Daily Living. A dependent is considered terminally ill when they have less than 12 months to live, cognitively impaired if they cannot perform at least two of six specified tasks, and loss of Activities of Daily Living requires assistance with at least two tasks for more than 90 days. The policy provides benefits to help the dependent with their care in such situations.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 35 (rows 2, 3, 1, 1), the term "Loss of Activities of Daily Living" refers to an insured employee or dependent's inability to safely and independently perform at least two out of six essential daily activities without substantial assistance. These activities include eating, toileting, transferring (moving from a bed to chair), bathing, dressing, and continence. This loss must be due to a covered injury or illness, and the inability pertains to the individual's entire body functions rather than a localized condition. The inability must persist for an extended period, not just temporarily.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, a Terminally Ill status is given when an Insured Employee or Dependent has a medical condition that is expected to lead to death within 12 months, despite receiving appropriate treatment. This classification triggers certain benefits. The timeline for this condition is strictly enforced, with the diagnosis determining the policyholder's eligibility for benefits during the following 12-month period.

This organization comprises insurance companies licensed in Arkansas for life, health, and accident insurance. The purpose is to safeguard policyholders within limits if a member insurer becomes financially incapable of meeting obligations. In such an event, the Guaranty Association will levy other members for funds to pay claims and, in some instances, maintain coverage. However, this protection is not unlimited and should not replace careful selection of stable and well-managed insurance companies. As per the document, policyholders in Arkansas purchasing these types of insurance are covered by this association from 01/01/21.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf on pages 36, rows 1-3 details the Arkansas Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Act (Act).

<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf, page 38, row 1, the amount the Guaranty Association is obligated to cover is subject to certain limitations. Specifically, the coverage limit per claimant is $300,000 or the total amount of insurance coverage in force on the policyholder, whichever is less. Moreover, for policies issued between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2025, the maximum aggregate coverage provided by the Guaranty Association for each insolvent insurer is $5 million, subject to a 6% surplus margin requirement. After 2025, this aggregate coverage limit will increase annually, based on the consumer price index, until it reaches $7.5 million in 2031. Additionally, the Guaranty Association's coverage does not extend to certain types of losses, such as contractual penalties or consequential damages, and is subordinate to any prior rights or security interests.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 5439095.pdf highlights the Guaranty Association's limits on payouts. The Association will not exceed what an insurance company would owe under a policy or contract. For one insured life, the maximum payout is $300,000 in life and annuity benefits, $500,000 in health insurance benefits, and $1,000,000 for unallocated annuity benefits, regardless of the number of policies or types of coverage. Within these overall limits, the Association will not pay more than $300,000 in disability and long-term care benefits, health insurance benefits, present value of annuity benefits, or life insurance death benefits/net cash surrender values. These limits are in place before considering the Guaranty Association's subrogation and assignment rights or the assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer.
