According to Unum Policy 4739187 on page [27], you are deemed disabled when the insurer determines that you cannot perform the significant duties of your regular occupation due to illness or injury, and have lost at least 20% in indexed monthly earnings from the same cause. After 24 months of payments, disability is defined as an inability to work any gainful occupation for which you are qualified by education, training, or experience. You must be under a physician's care to be considered disabled. A loss of professional or occupational license does not equate to disability. Unum may request examinations from their chosen physicians, medical practitioners, and vocational experts, covering costs. They can require examinations as needed and interviews with authorized Unum representatives.

In accordance with Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, if you potentially qualify for benefits under items 1, 2, and 3 in the deductible sources of income section, we'll estimate your entitlement. Your Long Term Disability payment may be reduced by these estimated amounts if the benefits: a) haven't been awarded; b) haven't been denied; or c) have been denied but are being appealed. However, reduction will not occur if you apply for and appeal denials at all administrative levels Unum deems necessary, sign their payment option form, and promise to repay any overpayment caused by an award.

Your payment will be adjusted upon receipt of proof of the awarded amount or completion of all necessary appeals. If an adjustment reduces your payment, a lump sum refund of the estimated amount will follow. Lump sum payments from deductible sources are pro-rated monthly over the specified time period, with a reasonable one applied when no time is stated.

Under Unum Policy 4739187, if you are disabled while working, the days you are unable to perform your regular work duties will contribute towards fulfilling your elimination period. This means that should you become disabled and continue working, your disability period would still count towards meeting the time requirement necessary before disability benefits can be activated. The elimination period, as defined in this policy, is generally 7 days for an Own Occupation benefit or 14 days for Any Occupation benefit. However, if you are receiving partial disability benefits during this period, the elimination period will end.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187, payments will commence upon approval of a validated claim, post the elimination period and if you're deemed disabled. The policy provides monthly payments for any eligible duration. This policy was updated on February 1st, 2008. To receive these benefits, both the elimination period must elapse and your disability status needs to be confirmed.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4739187, your disability benefits will be determined through a process that considers your monthly earnings prior to the disability and your total disability benefit amount. The policy pays a percentage of your pre-disability earnings; the exact percentage depends on your occupation. If you're engaged in sedentary work, 50% of your earnings are covered; for light work, 70%; for medium work, 80%; and for heavy or very heavy work, 90%. The total disability benefit amount cannot exceed $10,000 per month. These calculations are subject to a maximum of 60 times the basic monthly benefit. Any disability that lasts beyond 24 months will be evaluated annually, and payments may be adjusted based on your ability to perform work or changes in your earnings.

Under Unum Policy 4739187, your weekly disability payment is determined by comparing two amounts: the maximum weekly benefit and the answer derived from item 1 (gross income). The lesser of these two figures will serve as your gross disability payment. This calculation is outlined on page 20, row 4 of the policy document.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 4739187.pdf (page 28, row 9), your monthly disability payment (Item 4) is calculated. However, this amount will be reduced by any deductible sources of income you may have. It's crucial to note that these reductions are applied to ensure you receive the difference between your disability payment and your earned income. This policy applies throughout the duration of your disability benefit period.
<EOS>
In Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, the "Monthly Earnings" are crucial for determining disability benefits. For partners, this figure is their average monthly income from the year before disability, based on either the "net earnings (loss) from self-employment" line of the Schedule K-1 or the actual employment period if not a partner during that year. Exclusively from the Employer are these earnings considered. For employees, it's their average gross monthly income from the calendar year preceding disability, as indicated on the W-2 form or during the employment tenure if no W-2 was issued prior to disability. Gross income before taxes is what this average represents, excluding pre-tax contributions and certain allowances. Excluded are also non-Employer sources of income. This policy was updated on 2/1/2008 (LTD-BEN-3).
<EOS>
During a covered layoff or leave of absence as per Unum Policy 4739187, if you become disabled, the monthly earnings from your employer prior to the start of your absence will be used to calculate disability benefits. This means that your current salary just before your absence begins serves as the basis for determining your benefit amount.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, if you become disabled due to the same sickness or injury, and your monthly disability earnings are less than 20% of your indexed monthly earnings, Unum will send a monthly payment. If your monthly disability earnings range from 20% to 80%, Unum calculates the payment such that for the first 12 months while you're working, the monthly payment remains unchanged as long as the sum of your disability earnings and the gross disability payment does not exceed 100% of your indexed monthly earnings.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 4739187.pdf at page 21, row 8, your weekly lost earnings will be calculated and divided by your overall weekly earnings to determine the percentage of your wages you'll receive as benefits under this policy. This percentage will serve as the basis for the payment amount, ensuring fair compensation during your period of disability. The specific duration of these payments is contingent on the terms of your individual policy, including any qualifying conditions and maximum benefit periods stated therein.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, the weekly payment you receive is multiplied by the value in Item 2 (page 21, rows 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18). Unum reserves the right to demand proof of your disability earnings each week, adjusting your payment accordingly. As part of this verification process, you may be required to submit appropriate financial records, deemed necessary for substantiating your income by Unum.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4739187, if your disability earnings fluctuate significantly month-to-month, the policy averages your earnings over the previous 3 months to decide whether your claim should continue. Your claim will not be terminated unless the average of your disability earnings from these three months exceeds 80% of indexed monthly earnings. During any month when your disability earnings exceed 80% of indexed monthly earnings, you will not receive payment under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf on pages 30, rows 1 & 2, your disability payment will be reduced by certain deductible income sources. These include any wages you earn from working for another employer, any worker's compensation benefits, and any disability insurance payments from other policies that are payable for the same period of disability as this policy. Additionally, if you're a public safety officer, military reserve or National Guard member, or government employee under certain retirement systems, your pension contributions may also be considered deductible income. The specific reduction amount will be 85% of these earnings unless otherwise specified in your policy. Exclusions and limitations apply; consult your policy for details.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187, disability income payments may not be received concurrently with state compulsory benefit act or law benefits or any other group insurance plan. The policy specifies that the total amount of such combined benefits cannot exceed 85% of pre-disability earnings. Any discrepancies in this limit will result in a reduction from one of the benefits. This provision is effective on the start date of your disability income benefit and continues throughout the duration of your claim unless otherwise noted.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, your benefits may originate from three primary sources: under the mandatory portion of any "no fault" motor vehicle plan; under Title 46, United States Code Section 688 (The Jones Act); or from a third party following settlement or judgment, after deducting attorney's fees. The amount you receive could vary depending on these sources and may be subject to certain conditions. Benefits derived from the "no fault" motor vehicle plan will adhere to specific rules outlined in the policy, while benefits under The Jones Act might have unique eligibility criteria defined by Section 688 of Title 46. Any third-party compensation received after attorney's fees are deducted may impact your overall benefit amount.
<EOS>
This information from Unum Policy 4739187.pdf on pages [21, 22] outlines disability and retirement benefits derived from your employer's STD-BEN-4 (2/1/2008) retirement plan. Disability payments are benefits paid due to disability that do not decrease the retirement benefit if they occur. Retirement benefits stem from your employer's contributions to the plan.

Disability benefits that reduce retirement benefits are also considered as retirement benefits. Simultaneous distribution of retirement funds from the plan throughout your lifetime is assumed by Unum. Rolled-over or transferred amounts are not included.

The Internal Revenue Code Section 402 definition for an eligible retirement plan applies, including future amendments. Deductible sources of income resulting from the same disability are the only ones deducted.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, several income sources will not be deducted from your disability payment. These include but are not limited to: 401(k), profit sharing, thrift plans, tax-sheltered annuities, stock ownership plans, non-qualified deferred compensation plans, pension plans for partners, military pensions and disability income, credit disability insurance, franchise disability income, retirement plans from other employers, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), individual disability income plans, no-fault motor vehicle plans, salary continuation or accumulated sick leave plans. These sources of income are not considered when calculating your disability payment.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, the minimum monthly payment under the LTD benefit is either $100 or 10% of your gross disability payment. Whichever figure is greater will apply. Notably, Unum may utilize this amount towards settling any outstanding overpayments. This regulation is outlined on pages [31, 32] in rows [1, 2, 2, 3, 5].
<EOS>
This information from Unum Policy 4739187.pdf on pages [32, 33] outlines the maximum period of disability payments. The duration depends on your age at disability: less than 62 years old follows Social Security Normal Retirement Age; 62 years receives 60 months (LTD-BEN-7); 63 and 64 receive 48 and 42 months respectively; 65, 36 months; 66, 30 months; 67, 24 months; 68, 18 months; and 69 or older, 12 months. Age of Social Security Normal Retirement for various years ranges from 65 to 67 depending on birth year (e.g., born before 1937, 65 years; born in 1955, 66 years 2 months). The policy also states that the maximum payment period is based on your disability age and not the Social Security retirement age.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, payments will cease under the following circumstances:

- Within the first 24 months, if you can work part-time in your regular occupation but opt not to;
- After 24 months, if you can engage in any part-time gainful occupation but choose not to;
- If your disability earnings exceed 80% of indexed monthly earnings, from the date they surpass 80%;
- At the end of the maximum payment period;
- If you are no longer disabled according to plan terms (unless eligible for Unum's Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program);
- If you fail to submit proof of continuing disability;
- After 12 months of payments if residing outside the United States or Canada, defined as spending more than half of any 12 consecutive months abroad;
- Upon your death.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, the following disabilities are not covered: self-inflicted injuries, participation in a riot, loss of professional or occupational license/certification due to criminal conviction, pre-existing conditions, or any disability resulting from war, declared or undeclared. The plan does not provide coverage during incarceration periods. This information can be found on pages 34 and 35, rows [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 2].
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf (page 24, rows 2, 4-10), if your current disability is related to the same cause(s) as a prior claim for which Unum made a payment, you will not need to complete another elimination period while working full time for 14 consecutive days or less. However, should you return to work on the 15th day, your current disability would be treated as a new claim subject to all provisions and requiring a new elimination period.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, if your current disability is unrelated to your prior claim, you will not need to complete another elimination period when working full-time for less than a day. However, your new disability will be subject to the same terms as your previous one unless you don't meet conditions 1 or 2 specified above, in which case it becomes a new claim and all policy provisions apply. If eligible for payments under another group short-term disability plan, you are ineligible for Unum benefits (STD-OTR-1 from 2/1/2008).
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, the program offered helps individuals return to work by providing vocational rehabilitation and assistance. Eligibility is determined by Unum at their discretion, requiring medical ability for return-to-work programs. A review of your claim file will analyze both medical and vocational information to determine an appropriate return-to-work program.

The program may include various services such as coordinating with employers, providing adaptive equipment or job accommodations, vocational evaluations, job placement, resume preparation, job skills training, and education/retraining expenses for a new occupation. Unum makes the final decision on your participation and will provide a written rehabilitation plan tailored to your needs.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4739187, a supplementary disability benefit of 10% up to $1,000 per month is provided, exempt from policy provisions increasing or decreasing the amount, except for the Total Benefit Cap. This extra payment is given for three months after your disability ends, if you're participating in their Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program and are unable to find employment. The benefit may be paid in a lump sum. This arrangement is subject to termination if you find employment during the benefit period.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4739187, the Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program benefits will terminate on the earliest of these dates:

1. When Unum determines your ineligibility for continued participation in this program.
2. If monthly payments would cease according to the plan at any other specified date.

These benefits are governed by LTD-OTR-3 (issued 2/1/2008).
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187, page 28 row 6, your monthly disability payment will be determined by comparing the answer from Item 1 (your pre-disability earnings) with the maximum monthly benefit. The lesser of these two amounts is what you will receive as your gross disability payment. It's essential to note that this policy applies only if your disability prevents you from performing the material duties of any occupation for which you are reasonably suited by education, training, or experience. This payment is subject to applicable taxes and begins upon the date specified in the policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187, the total monthly benefit provided under this plan will not surpass 100% of your earnings. Participation in Unum's Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program allows for a slightly higher benefit, up to 110% of your monthly earnings. This information can be found on page 28, rows 1-5 of the policy document.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, if the result from Item 1 is equal to or less than 100% of your indexed monthly earnings, no further reductions will be made to your monthly payment. Conversely, if it exceeds 100%, Unum will deduct the excess from your monthly payment. After 12 months of payments while working, you'll receive subsequent payments based on the percentage of income loss due to disability.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4739187, the percentage of lost earnings is determined by dividing your disability benefit by your indexed monthly earnings at the time the claim was filed. This policy offers a replacement of up to 60% of your pre-disability earnings during the initial period of disability and up to 55% during the extended period of disability. The benefits will continue until you return to work or reach age 65, provided the disability continues.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187, the monthly payment amount you receive is determined by multiplying the figure stated in Item 2. Unum may request proof of your disability earnings at least every quarter, and they will adjust your payment based on these earnings. Appropriate financial records may be required for this purpose. After the elimination period, if your disability lasts less than a month, you'll receive 1/30 of your monthly payment for each day of disability. This policy was updated on 2/1/2008.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf on pages 30 rows 6, 7, and 8, the benefits you receive are contingent upon three key factors: a workers' compensation law, an occupational disease law, or any other legislation with similar intent. Eligibility is determined by the presence of these laws in the state where the disability occurred. The policy will pay up to 24 months of your monthly salary, subject to specific maximum and minimum limits. Any benefits from these sources must be reported to Unum, as they may impact the amount you receive under this policy. Additionally, any changes to these sources during the benefit period should also be communicated promptly.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187, page 30 rows 11-15, the disability income you receive is not affected by state compulsory benefit acts or laws, other group insurance plans, or governmental retirement systems related to your employer. This applies only if these benefits are received independently of your disability income from Unum. Additionally, should you receive a lump sum payment from a third-party settlement for workers' compensation claims, such funds may be offset against your disability benefit payments under certain conditions. The offset percentage depends on the nature and timing of the settlement.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, under the disability benefits section on pages 30 row numbers 18, 20, 21, 22, and 23, if you become disabled, your disability payments may be reduced by any disability income received from other sources, such as the United States Social Security Act, Canada Pension Plan, Quebec Pension Plan, or any similar plan or act. The reduction is proportional to the amount you receive or are entitled to from these sources, and it does not affect retirement benefits. This provision applies equally to you, your spouse, and your children. The exact reduction percentage varies based on your specific circumstances, as detailed in the policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, if you receive retirement payments from the United States Social Security Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the Quebec Pension Plan, or any comparable plan or legislation, your retirement benefits will be reduced proportionately. The reduction percentage is based on the amount of your spouse's or children's retirement payments received. For instance, if 50% of your benefit goes to your spouse or child, your retirement payment from this policy will be reduced by 50%. This reduction applies only when you and your dependent(s) are all receiving retirement payments simultaneously. The effective date for these reductions is the later of the dates on which both your retirement payments and their payments begin.
<EOS>
This information from Unum Policy 4739187.pdf (pages 30-31, rows 36 to 18) details the nature of disability and retirement payments under an employer's retirement plan. Disability payments are those benefits paid due to disability that do not reduce the retirement benefit (if not for the disability). These payments are considered based on the employer's contribution to the retirement plan, with disability benefits reducing the retirement benefit also being considered as a retirement benefit.

The policy specifies that any retirement funds from the retirement plan will be distributed simultaneously throughout your lifetime, considering both yours and your employer's contributions. Retirement payments begin when you reach either age 62 or the normal LTD-BEN-5 (2/1/2008) retirement age as defined in your employer's retirement plan.

The definition of an eligible retirement plan is according to Section 402 of the Internal Revenue Code, including any future amendments that may affect the definition. Amounts received do not include amounts rolled over or transferred to any eligible retirement plan.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, for disability benefits under the Jones Act, only non-retirement income sources linked to the same disability will be deducted from your payments. Exclusions apply for Social Security retirement income if your disability onset occurs after age 65 and you were already receiving such payments prior.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf on pages 32 rows 1-3, any deductible income subtracted from your gross disability payment will not be subject to further reductions due to cost-of-living increases from that source. The policy ensures that even with such increases, your disability payment remains unaffected. It is essential to note that the initial reduction of your payment by the deductible income serves as the sole adjustment, and no further reductions will be made due to subsequent cost-of-living increases stemming from that source.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Policy 4739187, disabilities primarily based on self-reported symptoms or resulting from mental illness have a lifetime cumulative maximum benefit period of 24 months. Payments for any combination of such disabilities will not exceed this limit, regardless if they are unrelated or non-continuous. However, payments may continue beyond the 24-month period if you meet certain conditions, as specified in LTD-BEN-8 (2/1/2008). This policy is found on pages [33, 34] of the document, with relevant information in rows [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 1, 3, 4].
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, if you are confined to a hospital or institution at the end of the 24-month period, they will continue sending payments during your confinement. If you remain disabled upon discharge, they will provide additional payments for a recovery period up to 90 days. If reconfined during this recovery period for at least 14 consecutive days, they will send more payments during that extra confinement and another recovery period of up to 90 days.
<EOS>
This Unum Policy 4739187 outlines that if you receive payments after the initial 24-month period due to disability, and then are hospitalized or institutionalized for at least 14 consecutive days, subsequent payments will be made during your confinement duration. However, payments will cease either at the end of the specified limited pay period or upon reaching the maximum payment period, whichever comes first. The policy does not apply the mental illness limitation to dementia resulting from stroke, trauma, viral infection, Alzheimer's disease, or other conditions not typically treated by a mental health provider.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, a pre-existing condition is identified if medical treatment, consultation, care, services, or diagnostic measures were received, prescribed drugs or medicines were taken within the three months preceding your policy's effective date. The disability must also begin during the first 12 months after the effective date of coverage to be considered a pre-existing condition.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, if a policyholder experiences a recurrent disability within six months following the end of their prior claim and has remained continuously insured under the plan during this period, the recurrent disability will be considered an extension of the original claim. No additional elimination period is required. However, any disability occurring after six months from the end of the prior claim will be treated as a new claim, subject to all policy provisions including the elimination period. Simultaneous payments under any other group long-term disability plan make a holder ineligible for Unum payments. This information pertains to claims filed on or after February 1, 2008.
<EOS>
This information from Unum Policy 4739187.pdf (page numbers [36], rows [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 30, 32, 33]) outlines the Survivor Benefit provisions. If eligible and terminally ill with a life expectancy less than 12 months, you can receive a lump sum equivalent to 3 months of your gross disability payment. Eligibility is contingent on receiving a physician's written certification confirming a terminal illness and reduced life expectancy.

If you die while still disabled and meeting the plan's conditions, your survivor will receive a lump sum equal to 3 months of your gross disability payment. If no eligible survivors are found, payment goes to your estate, unless none exists. Prior to death, if diagnosed terminally ill, you may receive the benefit, but any overpayment will be applied first, and no subsequent survivor benefit is payable upon death. This benefit can only be claimed once on a voluntary basis.

<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, a Dependent is defined as your child(ren) under the age of 15 or any family member who requires personal care assistance, regardless of their age. The policy extends coverage for children above 15 years old as well. This definition applies on pages [42] rows [23, 24, 25]. Importantly, it's noted that a Dependent may require personal care assistance, suggesting such individuals have specific needs for long-term support.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf, Disability Earnings refer to the income you receive while disabled, encompassing your current earnings and potential income if working at maximum capacity during the period of disability. To qualify for benefits, you must have been continuously employed for at least one year prior to the disability onset and meet the policy's definition of total disability. Benefits are calculated based on a percentage of your pre-disability earnings, which may vary depending on your specific plan details. The benefit period can extend up to age 65 or the end date specified in your policy, whichever comes first.

<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187.pdf on pages 42 and specific rows 45, 47, and 48, Gainful Occupation refers to a job that generates an income within one year of your return to work. This income must meet certain thresholds: if you're employed, it should be at least 80% of your indexed monthly earnings; if not, it should be a minimum of 60%. These percentages are determined based on the policyholder's pre-disability earnings and are subject to indexing.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187, page 42 row 51, a grace period is granted for late premium payments. During this time, the overdue payment can be made without causing policy termination. The duration of the grace period varies based on the policy type but typically ranges from 30 to 60 days. If the payment isn't received within this period, the policy may be terminated. It is essential to note that any interest or fees due will still accrue during the grace period.

Under Unum Policy 4739187, the Gross Disability Payment refers to the total benefit amount before deductions for any income sources or disability earnings. If you are deemed disabled, your payment will be calculated based on this definition. The policy excludes certain conditions and earnings, but it's essential to note that specific details about these exclusions can be found elsewhere in the document. In calculating your Gross Disability Payment, Unum considers your pre-disability earnings up to a maximum monthly benefit of $15,000 or 66 2/3% of your pre-disability earnings, whichever is less. This payment will continue for the duration of your disability, as long as you remain disabled and meet the policy's continued participation requirements.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187, Page 43, Row 3, Hospital or Institution refers to a licensed and accredited facility that provides care for the condition leading to your disability. For your claim to be valid, this care must occur within the policy term. It is essential to ensure that the facility you choose is appropriately licensed and accredited. The policy does not specify any particular type of institution, but it should be equipped to treat the specific disabling condition.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4739187, the Indexed Monthly Earnings refer to your earnings' adjustment annually by the lesser of 10% or the current annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U), published by the U.S. Department of Labor. This adjustment ensures your indexed monthly earnings can only increase or remain the same, but never decrease. Unum reserves the right to use an alternative similar measurement if the Department of Labor alters or ceases publishing the CPI-U. The indexing is applicable for determining the percentage of lost earnings while you're disabled and working, as well as the determination of gainful occupation.
<EOS>
