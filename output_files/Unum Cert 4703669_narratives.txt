According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, under the B@G-LTD-1 provision (effective as of 6/27/2012), a specific term life insurance policy is outlined. This policy stipulates that death benefits will be paid out if the insured dies during the specified term. The death benefit amount is typically equal to the coverage limit selected at the time of purchase. Any outstanding policy loans or interest are subtracted from the death benefit amount before distribution. Additionally, a provision for waiver of premium exists in case of disability, allowing the policyholder to continue coverage without making payments if they become disabled during the policy term.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, this long-term disability plan offers financial support by paying a percentage of your pre-disability income during periods of disability. The exact amount is determined based on your earnings prior to the onset of disability. In specific circumstances, you may receive disability payments concurrently with employment.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, page 4, row 11, the effective date of this policy is June 1, 1998. This means that benefits under this policy will commence from this date.

The policy duration is for a period of five years, or until age 65 if earlier. Partial disability benefits are applicable under certain conditions, with a benefit percentage of 60% for own occupation and 40% for any occupation. If total disability persists beyond the initial 24-month period, the policy provides residual (partial) benefits based on the extent of incapacity. A maximum of 24 months is allowed for receiving benefits under the defined 'own occupation' clause, after which the policy switches to the 'any occupation' definition.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, physicians actively employed by the stated employer in the United States are eligible for coverage. This group includes all medical professionals working within the country under the employ of the specified entity. The eligibility is not limited to any specific medical specialties or years of experience. However, any changes in employment status must be reported promptly to maintain coverage validity. Eligible individuals can access benefits in accordance with the outlined policy terms and conditions.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, a minimum of 30 hours per week must be worked by employees to be eligible for coverage. This requirement applies universally to all employees in the policy's scope. The weekly threshold ensures that every employee receives adequate benefits under this plan.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on page 4, there are different waiting periods for eligible employees based on their employment start date. For those employed prior to June 1, 1998, there is no specific waiting period. However, for employees joining an eligible group after this date, a 30-day continuous active employment requirement applies before disability benefits can be claimed.
<EOS>
According to the REHIRE section in Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 4, row numbers 33 and 34, if your employment terminates and you are rehired within a year, any previous work undertaken while being part of an eligible group can be counted towards the waiting period. All other policy provisions shall apply in this case. This benefit is subject to the standard terms and conditions outlined in the insurance policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 4, row 38, your employer is responsible for covering the policy costs under this insurance plan. This coverage extends to you as long as you remain employed with the company providing the coverage. No additional premiums are required from you. The details of this arrangement may be subject to change if there are alterations in your employment status or the terms of the group insurance contract.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, the elimination period for Short Term Disability benefits is either 180 days or the date when your Short Term Disability payments conclude, if applicable. Benefits commence following the completion of this period, starting on the day after.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 4, rows 51, 53, and 54, this policy provides a monthly benefit equating to 60% of your earnings, capped at $15,000 per month.

According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, the Maximum Period of Payment varies based on your age at disability. If you're under 62 years old, payments will continue until age 67, for a total of 60 months. For ages 63-65, the duration reduces, from 48 to 36 months. At age 66, payments last 30 months, and for ages 67-69, they extend up to 24 and 18 months, respectively. After age 69, payments continue for 12 months. Notably, no premium payments are required while receiving benefits under this plan. This plan was amended on B@G-LTD-2 (6/27/2012).
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, under the Other Features section (row 10 on page 5), Continuity of Coverage is a significant aspect. In case of death or disability, coverage continues without interruption, ensuring financial stability for policyholders and their families. The policy provides continuation benefits up to the age of 65, with the premiums being converted into guaranteed issue whole life insurance. The premiums are subject to change annually, as outlined in the Policy Provisions section. Additionally, the policy requires that premiums be paid on a monthly basis and, in case of missed payments, there may be temporary suspension of coverage or possible termination. It's crucial to keep up with premium payments to maintain uninterrupted coverage.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, under the Minimum Benefit section (page 5, row 16), pre-existing conditions are subject to a 3/12 rule. This means that if you have a medical condition diagnosed or treated within 12 months before your policy effective date, it will be considered a pre-existing condition. However, the waiting period for this condition's benefits is reduced to 3 months instead of the standard elimination period, provided the claimant has been symptom-free for at least 6 consecutive months before the effective date. This rule applies only to eligible policyholders who have purchased their coverage within specified guidelines.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, pages 5 and 6, under the Survivor Benefit section (rows 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 2), this insurance plan offers a survivor benefit as part of your Employer's Benefit Program. While enrollment, risk management, and other support services are included, a full description can be found in the certificate of coverage section. Upon request, either an electronic or paper copy will be provided free of charge. This plan was updated on 6/27/2012 under LTD-CLM-1.

Written notice should be submitted within 30 days after the disability starts, and proof of the claim must be provided no later than 90 days after the elimination period. If providing proof within 90 days is impossible, it should be given no later than one year, except in the absence of legal capacity. The claim form can be obtained from your employer or directly requested from Unum. If you do not receive the form within 15 days of your request, submit written proof of the claim without waiting for the form. Notify Unum immediately if you return to work in any capacity.
<EOS>
To file a claim at Unum (Cert 4703669), you and your employer are required to complete the respective sections of the provided claim form. After that, submit the filled-out document to your attending physician for them to fill in their section. The completed form should then be sent directly to Unum. This process is crucial for the initiation of your claim procedure.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, to prove your disability claim, you must submit:

1. Proof of regular physician care.
2. Documentation of monthly earnings.
3. The start date and cause of the disability.
4. Details on the extent of disability, including work-related restrictions and limitations.
5. Information about any hospitals or institutions where treatment was received, along with attending physicians' names and addresses.

7. In certain cases, additional medical information and non-medical data might be required.
8. Authorization for Unum to obtain extra medical details and provide non-medical info may also be necessary as part of the proof process.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 6 and 7, row numbers 1 and 2, the policy states that payments will be made directly to you under LTD-CLM-2 as of June 27, 2012. This indicates that if you are eligible for benefits under this plan, payments will be issued to you personally. It's essential to adhere to all terms and conditions specified in the policy to ensure continued receipt of these payments.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, if overpayments occur on your claim due to fraud, errors in processing, or receipt of deductible income sources, you are required to reimburse the full amount. The repayment method will be determined by Unum. They will not recover more than the amount initially paid to you.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on page 8, the certificate of coverage is a statement detailing your potential benefits, payable recipients, and conditions within the plan. The document outlines your coverage, specifies who receives payments from Unum, and lists any applicable limitations, exclusions, and requirements under the policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, eligibility for coverage is determined when you are employed by your group's employer, provided the group is eligible. The eligibility date falls on the later of two instances: either the plan's effective date or the day following the completion of your waiting period.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, your coverage begins as follows: If your employer pays the full cost of the policy, you're covered at 12:01 a.m. on the eligibility date. When you or your employer share the cost or pay individually, you are covered at 12:01 a.m., either on the eligibility date if you apply beforehand, within 31 days after eligibility, or upon Unum's approval of your application (if evidence of insurability is required due to late application or reapplying after voluntary cancellation). Evidence of insurability can be obtained from your employer.
<EOS>
According to the policy in Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, your coverage will commence once you return to active employment following an absence due to injury, sickness, temporary layoff, or leave of absence. The effective date for your coverage is established upon your return to work, and this stipulation applies regardless of the reason for your absence from work.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669 on pages 8, rows 1-3, if you experience a temporary layoff and consistently pay the premium, your coverage will be maintained through the month directly following the one in which your temporary layoff commences. This ensures that you remain protected during this transitional period.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, during a leave of absence, coverage is provided up until the month immediately following the one in which your leave commences, provided premiums are being paid. This means that if your leave begins in October, for instance, you'll remain covered until the end of November. It's important to note that this applies only when premium payments continue during your absence.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, any increases or additional coverage under your policy will take immediate effect if you are actively employed, on a covered layoff, or leave of absence. If absent due to injury or illness, coverage begins upon your return to work. Decreases in coverage apply immediately but do not affect claims made prior to the decrease.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, your coverage under the policy or plan will end on the earliest of the following:

- Cancellation of the policy or plan.
- Your exclusion from an eligible group.
- The cessation of coverage for your eligible group.
- The final day for which you made required contributions.
- The last day you remain in active employment, except as provided under the covered layoff or leave of absence provision. Notably, Unum will cover a payable claim that occurs while you are insured under the policy or plan.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, you have 60 days following proof of claim submission to initiate legal action regarding your claim. The statute of limitations for such actions is 3 years from the required proof of claim date, unless federal law provides otherwise. This timeframe may vary based on specific circumstances or legislation.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, any statements provided in your or your employer's signed application for coverage are considered representations rather than warranties. If these statements are found to be incomplete or untrue at the time of submission, Unum retains the right to either reduce or deny any claim, or cancel the policy effective from its original start date. Statements made in a signed application will be used as grounds for such actions. However, after two years of coverage, these statements cannot be utilized to reduce or deny claims. In cases where the employer provides incorrect information about you, Unum will use it to determine your coverage under the plan, in accordance with the policy provisions and amounts specified.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, page 10, row 1, the policy includes a provision for adjusting premiums fairly. This adjustment may be necessary due to changes in the employee's salary or other factors. The adjustment is expected to be made as per the policy guidelines, and it is crucial that any such adjustments are communicated promptly. The policy does not specify a particular timeframe for making these adjustments, but it emphasizes their importance and fairness. The percentage of adjustment will depend on the specific circumstances of each case. It's essential to note that this provision applies only to Employee-3, effective from 6/27/2012.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on page 10, Unum is committed to preventing insurance fraud that might lead to unnecessary costs for you and your employer. They vow to employ all necessary means for detecting, investigating, and prosecuting fraud cases. It's considered a crime to intentionally provide false, incomplete, or misleading information to Unum with the aim of defrauding or deceiving them. Actions that contain materially false information may lead to claim denial, prosecution, and punishment under state and/or federal law. If insurance fraud occurs, Unum will take appropriate legal action.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 10 (rows 1-2), this policy does not replace or supersede the compulsory coverage under workers' compensation and state disability insurance. In other words, your entitlements from this insurance are contingent upon qualifying for those programs as well.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf (page 10 and 11, rows 1, 2, 2, 3), your employer serves as either its own representative or an agent for you, but never on behalf of Unum. This policy stipulation was established on June 27, 2012 (LTD-BEN-1).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on page 11, disability is defined as a determination by Unum that you are unable to perform the material and substantial duties of your regular occupation due to sickness or injury, coupled with a loss of 20% or more in indexed monthly earnings caused by the same condition. Examinations by physicians, other medical practitioners, or vocational experts may be required at Unum's discretion, and they will cover costs. Interviews by authorized Unum representatives are also possible. A professional or occupational license loss does not automatically equate to disability status.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, if you qualify for benefits under items 1, 2, and 3 in the deductible sources of income section and these benefits have not been awarded, denied, or are being appealed, your Long Term Disability payment may be reduced by an estimated amount. However, this reduction will not occur if you apply for these benefits and appeal any denial to all administrative levels deemed necessary by Unum, while signing their payment option form. An overpayment adjustment is made when proof of awarded amounts or completed appeals is provided; a lump sum refund will be issued in such cases. If a lump sum is received from any deductible sources, it will be prorated monthly over a reasonable time period if no specific duration is stated. This information can be found on pages [15, 16] of the document, rows [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 2, 3].
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on page 11, row 1, if you meet the policy's definition of disability, you can still satisfy your elimination period while working. However, any earnings during this period will be reduced proportionately, with a maximum reduction of 85% of the weekly benefit amount. The elimination period lasts for 30 days from the start date of your disability. It's essential to understand that continuing work may impact the duration of your disability benefits. This information is subject to the terms and conditions outlined in your policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 11, rows 1-3, benefit payments will commence once your claim is approved, assuming the elimination period has been fulfilled and you are deemed disabled. Regular monthly payments will be sent for any qualifying duration. The payment frequency is monthly, and the coverage is valid as long as Unum assumes liability.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, your disability benefit payment will be determined as follows: if you're unable to perform the duties of your own occupation for a consecutive 24 months (or up to your Normal Retirement Age, whichever is earlier), we'll pay you 60% of your pre-disability monthly earnings. If your disability continues beyond that point and prevents you from performing any suitable occupation, we will continue to provide benefits, with the payment amount based on 45% of your pre-disability earnings. Any future increases in benefits due to cost-of-living adjustments are subject to Unum's discretion. This policy is effective upon receipt of the first premium payment.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, the monthly disability payment you receive is determined by comparing two amounts: your gross monthly benefit and the lesser of these two figures becomes your disability payment. This comparison can be found on page 11, row 6. It's essential to remember that this determination adheres to the policy outlined in Unum Cert 4703669.pdf.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Cert 4703669.pdf (page 12, rows 2, 3, 1), the monthly payment figure detailed in Item 4 represents your Long-Term Disability (LTD) benefit amount under LTD-BEN-2 policy issued on June 27, 2012. Notably, any deductible sources of income must be subtracted from this monthly disability payment.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Cert 4703669.pdf (page 12, rows 1-6), your "Monthly Earnings" are defined as the gross income from your employer before disability onset. This figure encompasses all earnings before taxes but excludes contributions to deferred compensation plans, Section 125 plans, or flexible spending accounts. Notably, it does not incorporate income derived from commissions, bonuses, overtime pay, additional compensations, or sources other than your employer.
<EOS>
During a covered layoff or leave of absence as outlined in Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, if you become disabled, your monthly earnings from your employer effective just prior to the commencement of your absence will be used for disability benefits calculation. This means that the income you had before taking the leave or going on layoff will serve as a basis for determining your disability benefits.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669 on page 12 rows [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11], if you become disabled due to the same sickness or injury, and your monthly disability earnings are less than 20% of your indexed monthly earnings, Unum will send you a monthly payment. If your monthly disability earnings range between 20% and 80% of your indexed monthly earnings, Unum will calculate your payment such that for the first 12 months while working, there will be no reduction as long as the combined disability earnings plus gross disability payment do not surpass 100% of your indexed monthly earnings.
<EOS>
In Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, if the response from Item 1 does not exceed or equal 100% of your indexed monthly earnings (page 12, rows 16-17, 19-20, 22-23), no further reduction in your monthly payment will occur. However, if it surpasses 100%, Unum will deduct the excess percentage from your payment. After 12 months of payments while working, you'll receive a payment proportionate to the disability-related income loss percentage (page 12).
<EOS>
In accordance with the Unum Cert 4703669 policy on page 12, row 27, your benefit is calculated as a percentage of your lost earnings. To determine this, your monthly benefits will be divided by your indexed monthly earnings. This calculation may affect the amount you receive and could impact the coverage duration. Please note that specific details regarding the exact percentage may vary based on your individual circumstances.
<EOS>
This Unum policy (Cert 4703669) states that the monthly payment amount will be multiplied by the figure in Item 2. If required, provide quarterly proof of disability earnings. The payments will be adjusted accordingly based on these earnings. During the elimination period, Unum may request appropriate financial records to substantiate your income. After this period, if you are disabled for less than a month, you will receive 1/30 of your payment for each day of disability. After the first month of disability, payments continue indefinitely at the calculated amount.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, if your disability earnings fluctuate significantly from month to month, they may average your earnings over the previous 3 months to decide whether to continue your claim. Your claim will not be terminated unless the average of the last three months' disability earnings surpasses 80% of indexed monthly earnings. However, no payments will be made for any month where disability earnings exceed this percentage limit.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf (page 13, rows 1-2), any disability payment received under this policy may be reduced by certain deductible sources of income. These include:

1. Short-term or long-term disability benefits from your employer or another insurance company, if these payments are payable due to the same disability for which you are receiving Unum's benefit.
2. Workers' compensation benefits or settlements related to work injuries or illnesses.
3. State disability benefits, such as Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and state temporary disability benefits.
4. Retirement plan payments or pensions that begin before age 65 due to your own retirement or disability.
5. Unemployment compensation, including extended unemployment benefits.
6. Military retirement pay, if you retired on disability.
7. Any other income received as a result of your sickness or injury.

The reduction will be made according to the lesser of the amount you receive from these sources or 80% of your Unum disability payment. This percentage may vary depending on the type of policy you hold with Unum.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf (pages 13, rows 6-8), your benefits are affected by various laws such as workers' compensation and occupational disease laws, as well as any other acts or legislation with similar intent. These laws determine the amount you receive or are entitled to receive. The percentage of your salary that can be paid out varies based on these specific laws, but it is subject to a maximum benefit limit stated in the policy. Additionally, any payments from these laws will reduce the benefits you receive under this policy. The duration of your benefits may also be influenced by these laws, with some potentially extending or shortening your payment period. It's essential to understand that any changes in these related laws can impact your benefits.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 13 (rows 11, 13, 14, 15), the disability income amount you receive or are eligible to receive excludes benefits derived from:

* State compulsory benefit acts or laws.
* Other group insurance plans unrelated to your employment with the Employer.
* Governmental retirement systems associated with your job with the Employer.

It's essential to note that any payments from these sources will not affect your disability income benefits under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 13 and relevant row numbers 18, 20, 21, 22, and 23, the benefits you, your spouse, or children may receive are contingent upon disability payments derived from multiple sources. These include but are not limited to:

- The United States Social Security Act
- The Canada Pension Plan
- The Quebec Pension Plan
- Any similar plan or act of comparable nature

The receipt of these benefits may impact the amount you receive under this policy, as they are considered supplementary income sources. It is essential to note that any modifications to these plans could potentially affect your benefit entitlement under this policy. Please consult the relevant authorities or legal advisors for updated information on these plans.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 13 and 14, if you receive retirement payments under the United States Social Security Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the Quebec Pension Plan, or any similar plan or act, your dependents' benefits may be affected due to these retirements. This policy was updated on LTD-BEN-4 (6/27/2012). The exact impact of these retirement payments on your dependents' benefits depends on the specific plan or act involved.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, disability payments under your employer's retirement plan are defined benefits paid due to disability and do not affect the retirement benefit if no disability occurred. These payments are based on your employer's contribution to the retirement plan, with disability benefits reducing the retirement benefit also considered as a retirement benefit.

The retirement funds from the retirement plan will be distributed simultaneously throughout your lifetime, considering both yours and your employer's contributions. The definition of an eligible retirement plan follows Section 402 of the Internal Revenue Code, including any future amendments. Amounts received do not include rolled-over or transferred amounts to any eligible retirement plan.

Lastly, you have the option to voluntarily elect to receive these payments when reaching the later of age 62 or the normal retirement age as defined in your employer's retirement plan.
<EOS>
Under Unum's policy as outlined in Cert 4703669.pdf, only post-disability income sources, excluding retirement payments, will be deducted from your payout, subject to the Jones Act. Subtractions will not be made for your Social Security retirement income if your disability onset occurs after age 65 and you were already receiving these benefits priorly. This policy is applicable to rows [29, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36] of the specified document page [14].
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 14 and 15, various income sources are not deductible from your gross disability payment. These include 401(k) plans, profit sharing plans, thrift plans, tax-sheltered annuities, stock ownership plans, non-qualified deferred compensation plans, pension plans for partners, military pensions and disability income, credit disability insurance, franchise disability income plans, retirement plans from another Employer, Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA), individual disability income plans, no fault motor vehicle plans, salary continuation or accumulated sick leave plans. Additionally, it mentions other unspecified sources not listed here. (6/27/2012)
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on page 15, the minimum monthly benefit payment is either $100 or 10% of your gross disability payment. If there's an outstanding overpayment, Unum may apply this amount to settle it. Keep in mind that this figure could be subject to adjustment as your situation evolves.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 15, rows 1-3, if a deductible income source is subtracted from your gross disability payment, Unum will not reduce your payment further due to any cost of living increase stemming from that particular income source. This means that the cost of living adjustments from these specific sources do not affect the disability benefits you receive. The deduction of the income source serves as a one-time reduction in your payments, preventing double reductions from both the original payment and potential cost of living increases.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, the length of payments for disability benefits is determined by your age at the time of disability. For individuals under 62 years old, payments continue up to age 67. If you're aged 62, you'll receive benefits for 60 months; if 63, 48 months; 64, 42 months; 65, 36 months; 66, 30 months; 67, 24 months; 68, 18 months; and over 69, 12 months. After these periods, payments cease. The maximum period of payment decreases as you age.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, your payments will cease and the claim will conclude on one of the following events:

1. If you're capable of working part-time in your usual occupation despite remaining disabled but opt not to do so.
2. At the end of the maximum payment period.
3. Upon determination that you no longer meet the plan's disability criteria.
4. If proof of continuing disability is not provided.
5. When your earnings from work exceed the allowable amount under the plan.
6. Upon your death.

According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, disabilities stemming from self-reported symptoms or mental illnesses have a maximum payout period of up to 24 months. However, payments may continue past the 24-month mark if either one or both conditions are met: either the disability significantly limits your ability to perform essential job functions with or without reasonable accommodations, or you undergo an organ transplant. It is essential to note that disabilities based on self-reported symptoms and mental illnesses are subject to this 24-month limitation.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, if you are confined in a hospital or institution at the end of the 24-month period, payments will continue. If you remain disabled upon discharge, additional payments are sent for up to 90 days recovery period. If you get reconfined during this recovery period and stay confined for at least 14 consecutive days, payments resume for that prolonged confinement and an extra recovery period of 90 days.
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 4703669.pdf policy section on pages 16 and 17 indicates that if you continue to be disabled after receiving payments for 24 months, and are hospitalized or institutionalized for at least 14 consecutive days, Unum will provide additional payments throughout your reconfinement period. However, payments will not extend beyond the limited pay period or maximum payment period, whichever comes first. The mental illness limitation will not apply to dementia if it results from stroke, trauma, viral infection, Alzheimer's disease, or other conditions not typically treated by a mental health provider using psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or similar methods. This policy was updated on 6/27/2012 (LTD-BEN-7).

According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, a pre-existing condition is defined as any medical issue for which you sought treatment, consultation, care, services, or prescribed medication within the three months preceding your coverage's effective date, or for which an ordinarily prudent person would have consulted a healthcare provider during the same period. The disability must also start within the first 12 months after your coverage begins to be considered a pre-existing condition.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, if a disability recurs within 6 months of ending a prior claim and the policyholder has been continuously insured, their recurrent disability will not require another elimination period and will be subject to the same plan terms as the prior claim (page [17]). Any disability that occurs after 6 months from the end of the prior claim will be considered a new claim, subject to all policy provisions (page [18]). Note that if the policyholder becomes entitled to payments under any other group long term disability plan, they will not receive payments under the Unum plan.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, upon receiving proof of death, a lump sum benefit equivalent to three months of your gross disability payment will be provided to your eligible survivor, if your disability had continued for at least 180 consecutive days and you were receiving or entitled to receive payments under the plan at the time of your death. If there are no eligible survivors, payment will be made to your estate (except in cases where no estate exists). The policy also states that any overpayment on your claim will first be deducted from the survivor benefit before it is disbursed.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 19 rows [1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10], when a policy becomes effective, coverage is provided by Unum for individuals not employed actively due to sickness or injury, who were previously insured under another policy (continuity of coverage). The coverage is contingent upon premium payment, limited to the amount that would have been paid by the prior carrier. Unum will adjust your payment to account for any liability of the previous carrier.
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 4703669.pdf section on pages [19, 20, 21], rows [14, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 2, 3], outlines conditions for receiving payments if disability results from a pre-existing condition after your employer changes insurance carriers to Unum. To be eligible, you must have been in active employment and insured under the plan on its effective date and also insured by the prior policy at the time of change.

If you meet these conditions, Unum will determine payments according to their plan provisions, but your payment will be the lesser of: a) the monthly benefit that would have been payable under the terms of the prior plan if it had remained in force; or b) the monthly payment under the Unum plan.

Your benefits will end on the earlier of two dates: 1) the end of the maximum benefit period under the plan, or 2) the date benefits would have ended under the prior plan if it had remained in force.

If you do not meet these conditions, Unum will not make any payments (LTD-OTR-2, 6/27/2012). If you only satisfy Item 2, your claim will be administered according to the Unum plan provisions (LTD-OTR-3, 6/27/2012).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 21, rows 1-3, to be eligible for the additional disability coverage (referred to as Disability Plus), you must already be insured under the Unum Long Term Disability (LTD) plan. The coverage is subject to all policy definitions and specific provisions detailed in this Rider. Essentially, if you meet the criteria of your existing LTD plan, you may also qualify for this supplementary disability benefit, with all its terms and conditions applying concurrently.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, Disability Plus coverage will commence on the later of either the effective date of this rider or your effective date under the LTD plan. The duration of Disability Plus coverage is contingent upon the rider remaining active and your continuous insurance coverage under the LTD plan. This policy does not specify an end date for Disability Plus coverage.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 21, rows [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12], Disability Plus benefits will be paid if you provide proof of disability under this rider and receive monthly payments from the LTD plan. The disability criteria involve loss of ability to safely perform two activities of daily living without assistance or verbal cues, or a deterioration in intellectual capacity requiring assistance or verbal cues for protection. These benefits start after the elimination period shown in the LTD plan, and they continue so long as you remain disabled under these terms.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, the Disability Plus benefit is calculated as 20% of your monthly earnings, with a maximum monthly payment of either the LTD plan's maximum monthly benefit or $5,000. Notably, this benefit amount is not influenced by policy provisions that would otherwise adjust it, such as Deductible Sources of Income. These terms apply only to the specified section on page 21, rows 1, 2, 4, and 5.
<EOS>
According to the Disability Plus Rider in Unum Cert 4703669.pdf (page numbers 21, 22 rows [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 2, 3]), coverage exclusions and limitations apply. The rider does not provide benefits for a loss resulting from:

2. Deterioration or loss in intellectual capacity requiring assistance or verbal cues for protection, either yours or others'.

These exclusions were updated on June 27, 2012 (LTD-OTR-4).

Notably, no survivor benefits are offered for this Disability Plus coverage.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 4703669 document on pages 22, rows 1 and 2, the Disability Plus coverage premium is waived while you are receiving monthly payments under the Long-Term Disability (LTD) plan.

<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, on row 3 of page 23, there is a provision (STATE REQ-1 dated 6/27/2012) stating that if an insured's disability continues after 24 months and they reach the age of 65, the policy will continue with 50% benefit payable up to the age of 67, following which it will terminate. This implies that upon reaching the age of 67, the insured will receive no further benefits under this policy.

This policy does not cover any difference between your pre-disability and post-disability earnings, regardless of whether you are working or not. The policy also states that benefits will be reduced by any other income received, such as workers' compensation, social security disability benefits, or other insurance payments for the same condition. This reduction is done on a dollar-for-dollar basis and will apply to the total disability benefits payable under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, a continuous disability period, referred to as the Elimination Period, must be satisfied before benefits can be received. This waiting phase varies and is determined based on the individual's elected option. For example, if an individual chooses a 30-day elimination period, they will not receive benefits for the first 30 days of disability. The total disability length is calculated from the date of disabling event until Unum determines the claim eligible for benefits. This phase ensures that individuals are still able to recover and return to work before benefits kick in.

According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 28, rows 42-44, Recurrent Disability refers to a condition worsening from a prior one for which Unum made Long Term Disability payments. The disability is considered recurrent if it is due to the same causes as the initial disability, implying that the original cause of the disability has returned or persisted in such a way that it results in a new period of disability. This definition applies only when the disability is not a continuation of the prior one but rather a distinct event with similar causative factors.

The initial MEPD determination is typically made using a combination of medical information, functional capacity assessments, job analysis, and other relevant data. Benefits are payable for the duration of the MEPD, unless the disability ends earlier due to recovery, death, or return to work.
<EOS>
In the Unum Cert 4703669.pdf document, it is clarified that 'Regular Occupation' refers to the job you were regularly performing before disability, as defined differently for physicians and other employees. For physicians, this includes their general or sub-specialty at the time of disability, certified by the American Board of Medical Specialties.

According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf, section ADDLSUM-1 (6/27/2012), under long-term disability benefits, if an employee is eligible for a regular retirement benefit from the City of New York Retirement System or another retirement system in the U.S., their monthly disability benefit will be reduced by 50%. This reduction applies if the employee's combined ages and years of creditable service equal or exceed 80 points, calculated using their age and years of creditable service as of the month preceding the one in which their disability begins. For example, if an employee is 60 years old with 20 years of creditable service, they would have 100 points (60 + 20 = 80). However, if they have less than 80 points, no reduction applies. This reduction is effective only for long-term disability benefits and does not affect other aspects of the policy.

According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf on pages 30 (rows 28-31), the disability benefit administration is shared between the Plan Administrator and the insurer. The insurer handles benefits provision in accordance with the issued insurance policy for the Plan. This policy outlines that total disability benefits, up to 60% of pre-disability earnings, are paid monthly during the duration of the disability. However, if an individual's disability is caused by a mental or nervous condition, the maximum payable benefit percentage decreases to 45%. The definition of disability for the first 24 months following the start date of disability is based on the claimant being unable to perform their own occupation; thereafter, it transitions to any gainful occupation.
