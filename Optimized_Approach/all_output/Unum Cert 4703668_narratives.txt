This Disability Plus Rider, as detailed in Unum Cert 4703668.pdf across pages 2, 4, 8, 9, 18, 19, and 21, is applicable to those receiving monthly payments under the Long-Term Disability (LTD) plan who are deemed disabled by Unum. Eligibility for this rider commences at the end of the elimination period specified in the LTD plan. The rider's applicability hinges on being disabled due to sickness, as determined by Unum.

   Exclusions or limitations under the policy will apply to this Disability Plus Rider. Benefits will not be granted for losses attributable to conditions where there is a loss of ability to safely and completely perform daily activities without assistance or verbal cues on the effective date of coverage, or where there's a deterioration or loss in intellectual capacity requiring assistance or verbal cues for protection.

   It is essential that all policy provisions which restrict or exclude coverage apply equally to this Disability Plus Rider. The benefit will not be paid if the loss results from the conditions mentioned earlier.

The employer covers the cost of coverage, and benefits begin after an elimination period (either 180 days or the end of short-term disability payments). Monthly benefits amount to 60% of earnings, capped at $15,000, with potential reductions for other income sources.

This Unum Cert 4703668.pdf details a Long Term Disability Plan (LTD), effective June 1, 1998, with Policy Number 24519 011, available to all employees excluding physicians in active employment in the United States under the Employer, provided they work at least 30 hours per week. The plan offers financial protection, paying a portion of an employee's income during disability. The amount received is based on pre-disability earnings and can sometimes be paid even when working during disability.

The waiting period varies depending on the hire date: new employees wait six months; those hired before June 1997 wait one month. Coverage begins upon meeting the eligibility requirements, such as being in an eligible group for a specified period (shown in each plan).

The LTD plan provides coverage up to age 65 or retirement, whichever comes first, and pays benefits for total disability (unable to perform one's own occupation) or partial disability (ability to perform some work but not the same occupation as before). The monthly benefit is typically 60% of the pre-disability earnings, with a minimum of $50 per month and a maximum of $14,000 per month.

Disability must begin while covered under the plan, and it includes conditions such as fatigue, stiffness, soreness, ringing in ears, dizziness, numbness, and loss of energy due to sickness (illness or disease). A survivor (spouse if living; otherwise children under age 25) may also receive benefits.

Unum Life Insurance Company of America administers the plan, and an employee is considered eligible for coverage if they meet the specified requirements under the plan.

According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, mental illness payments will be extended beyond the initial 24 months under two conditions. First, if you are confined to a hospital or institution at the end of the 24-month period and remain so, Unum will provide ongoing payments throughout your stay, with an additional recovery period of up to 90 days following discharge. If subsequent reconfinement occurs within this period and lasts for at least 14 days straight, further payments are granted during that time and for another potential 90-day recovery period. Secondly, if you continue to be disabled after the 24-month payment period and subsequently get hospitalized for at least 14 consecutive days, Unum will provide payments throughout the duration of your reconfinement. However, payments will not exceed the limited pay period or the maximum payment term, whichever comes first. Furthermore, the mental illness limitation will not apply to dementia caused by stroke, trauma, viral infection, Alzheimer's disease, or other conditions not typically treated with psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or similar methods if they are managed by a different healthcare provider. Your plan does not cover disabilities resulting from, contributed to by, or caused by any conditions not listed in the document.

This Unum Cert 4703668.pdf policy outlines exclusions and conditions for disability coverage. Coverage does not extend to intentionally self-inflicted injuries, active participation in riots, loss of a professional license, commission of crimes, pre-existing conditions, or disabilities due to war or while incarcerated. A pre-existing condition is defined as receiving medical treatment, consultation, care or services, taking prescribed drugs, or having symptoms that warrant a healthcare provider's consultation within 3 months before the effective date of coverage, which can cause a disability within the first 12 months after coverage.

If an employee returns to work full-time and experiences another disability, it will be considered part of their prior disability. Upon changing insurance carriers to Unum, if an employee was in active employment and insured under the plan on its effective date, while also being insured by the prior policy at the time of change, they may receive payment for a disability due to a pre-existing condition as long as they satisfy the pre-existing condition provision either under the Unum or the prior carrier's plan.

The maximum period of payment is the longest duration Unum will make payments for any one disability. Mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety are covered, treated by mental health providers, and usually managed using psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or other similar methods. The monthly benefit indicates the total amount an employee is insured under this plan, subject to a maximum benefit. The monthly payment is calculated after deducting any sources of income. Working 20% or more of one's indexed monthly earnings on a part-time basis is considered working on a part-time basis. A payable claim is one for which Unum is liable under the terms of the policy. Lastly, a physician includes those licensed to practice medicine, with a doctoral degree in Psychology, or legally qualified medical practitioners according to the governing jurisdiction's laws and regulations.

According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, upon proof of death, a lump sum benefit is paid to eligible survivors if the insured's disability persisted for 180 days or more and they were receiving disability payments under the plan at the time of death. The benefit equals 3 months of the gross disability payment. If there are no eligible survivors, payment goes to the estate; otherwise, any overpayment will be deducted first.

If an insured is not in active employment when their employer switches insurance carriers to Unum, continuity of coverage applies if they were covered by the prior policy and are unable to work due to sickness or injury. The payment under this situation will match what the prior carrier would have paid, subject to premium payment and reduction for any liabilities of the prior carrier.

Similarly, if a disability results from a pre-existing condition upon switching insurance carriers to Unum, coverage is provided under specific conditions: the insured must have been in active employment and covered by the plan on its effective date and insured by the prior policy at the time of change. The payment will match what the prior carrier would have paid, subject to premium payment and reduction for any liabilities of the prior carrier. To receive a payment, the insured must satisfy the pre-existing condition provision under either the Unum plan or the prior carrier's plan. If not, no payments are made.

This Unum Cert 4703668 document, located on page [22], reveals that disability benefit payments will cease upon the earliest occurrence of four events: your recovery from disability, ineligibility for monthly benefits under the LTD plan, reaching the maximum period of payment as shown in the LTD plan, or your death. No survivor benefits are offered for Disability Plus coverage. The Waiver of Premium for Disability Plus entails that no premiums are required while you receive monthly payments under the LTD plan. Critical dates and periods to be mindful of include disability cessation, eligibility changes in the LTD plan, maximum payment duration, and your mortality.
