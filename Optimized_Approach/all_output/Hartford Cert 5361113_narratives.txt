If you remain disabled after the elimination period and earn 20% or less of your indexed pre-disability earnings, we will calculate your monthly disability benefit as follows: multiply your pre-disability earnings by the benefit percentage (40%), compare this result with the maximum benefit, deduct any other income benefits, and the remaining amount is your monthly benefit.

If you earn more than 20% of your indexed pre-disability earnings, we will calculate your disability benefit for up to 12 consecutive months by multiplying your pre-disability earnings by the benefit percentage (40%), comparing this result with the maximum benefit, and using the lesser amount as your monthly benefit.

The day care benefit provides an annual amount equal to the lesser of: the product of your principal sum and the Day Care Benefit Percentage; or the maximum amount for this benefit. Upon your death, if there is no surviving spouse, we will pay the minimum amount for this benefit in accordance with the Claims to be Paid provision.

The Spouse Education Benefit is the least of: expense incurred for occupational training; the product of your principal sum and the Spouse Education Benefit Percentage; or the maximum amount for this benefit. If a principal sum is payable because of your death and there is no surviving spouse, we will pay the minimum amount for this benefit in accordance with the Claims to be Paid provision.

Benefit payments cease on the earliest of specified conditions, including the date you are no longer disabled, failure to provide proof of loss, refusal to submit to an examination, death, or reaching the maximum duration limit based on a table in the policy.

A Progressive Illness benefit is also included if diagnosed after coverage under this policy, subject to providing satisfactory proof from your physician. If you are eligible for this benefit and meet these conditions, payments will continue until one of the earlier termination criteria is met or the maximum duration limit is reached.

The cost of the long-term disability insurance is primarily paid by your employer, who may allocate part of this cost to you. You might also pay the entire premium based on the employer's decision. The insurance company determines the cost according to the rate structure reflected in the Policy of Incorporation, and any amounts paid by employees can be used to pay benefits or expenses under the plan (pages 62, 64).

In accordance with Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, your Disability benefits are calculated based on your Pre-disability Earnings and a Benefit Percentage. If you remain disabled beyond the Elimination Period and earn 20% or less of these Earnings, your Monthly Benefit will be determined by multiplying your Pre-disability Earnings with the Benefit Percentage. The resulting amount is compared to the Maximum Benefit; from this comparison, deduct Other Income Benefits to get your monthly benefit.

However, if you earn more than 20% of your Pre-disability Earnings, your Monthly Benefit will be calculated for up to 12 consecutive months by multiplying the Pre-disability Earnings with the Benefit Percentage. The resulting amount is again compared with the Maximum Benefit. To calculate this benefit, subtract your Current Monthly Earnings from your Pre-disability Earnings; the remaining sum after comparing it to the Maximum Benefit payable under the policy is your Monthly Benefit.

There's also a Return to Work Incentive provision that allows you to receive these benefits for up to 12 months if your earnings fall between 20% and 80% of your Pre-disability Earnings during this period. Lastly, the Infectious and Contagious Disease Benefit can be paid for an undefined duration but specific details on this matter are not provided in the document excerpt.
