All other benefits will be paid to the deceased employee's estate. If payment needs to be made to the estate, a minor, or an incompetent person who cannot provide a valid receipt, up to $2,000 may be given to any suitable relative as per the Company's determination. Any such payment made in good faith will exempt the Company from further obligation to pay that specific benefit again.
<EOS>
According to the Notice of Claim Decision in Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, if the Company denies any part of a claim, a written notice will be sent to the Insured Employee within 15 days after the claim is resolved or, if reasonably possible, within 45 days after receiving the first proof of claim. The notice explains the reason for denial based on the Policy terms and internal guidelines, outlines how the employee can request a review of the decision, and specifies whether additional information is required to support the claim.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on pages 11 and relevant rows, the company may require more than 15 days to process a claim due to unforeseen circumstances, with extensions allowed if necessary. A written delay notice will be sent to the Insured Employee by the 15th day after receiving the first proof of claim, followed by notifications every 30 days until resolution. This notice details what additional information is needed to establish liability and provides a timeframe for making a decision. If no decision is issued within 105 days from the initial claim submission, an immediate review is granted as if it were denied.
<EOS>
This document from Lincoln Cert 4939979 specifies an exceptional circumstance: the company may require additional information from the insured employee to process a claim. Such data should be provided within 45 days after their request, and any delay in submission will not affect the given timeframe for claim processing.
<EOS>
Per Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, within 180 days after receiving a denial notice, the Insured Employee can submit a written review request accompanied by supporting materials. The Company will review this claim and respond with a decision notice detailing reasons based on the Policy and internal guidelines. If the claim denial is upheld, the notice will also describe available appeal procedures, access to relevant claim information, and options for state insurance department review or legal action. This notice must be sent within 45 days unless special circumstances require up to 90 days.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939979 policy section outlines extended processing time for appeals in special cases. If the Company requires more than 45 days to process an appeal, they will provide a written delay notice by the 30th day after receiving the review request. The notice details the unique circumstances causing the delay, whether additional information is needed for claim review, and an estimated decision timeframe.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, pages 12, rows 40-41, if the Company needs additional information from the Insured Employee during an appeal process, it must be provided within 45 days following the request. Failure to do so may cause a delay in appeal processing that will not be factored into the stated time limits for resolution.
<EOS>
As per the Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on page 12, rows 44-49, an ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) plan participant or beneficiary must exhaust administrative remedies before bringing a legal action under Section 502(a). The Policy requires that such individuals first pursue two administrative reviews following an adverse claim decision, in accordance with this section. After completing the necessary reviews, an ERISA participant or beneficiary can instigate legal proceedings under the specified section. This process applies to claims subject to ERISA regulations.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on pages 12, rows 51, 52, and 53, the Company waives its right to claim that an individual failed to exhaust administrative remedies, allowing for direct filing of a lawsuit under ERISA if certain conditions are met. This provision applies in cases where a Notice of Intention to File Suit is submitted within one year following receipt of the benefit denial or termination notice, and where an internal appeal has not been pursued or was unsuccessful. Additionally, the individual must exhaust all other available remedies, including potential state law claims, prior to filing the lawsuit under ERISA.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf (pages 12 and 13), if overpayments occur on any short-term or long-term disability benefits, full reimbursement to the company is required within 60 days. Failure to repay may result in future benefit reductions, suspension of Minimum Monthly Benefits, reduction of benefits under other group insurance policies, or recovery from the employee or estate. Overpayments can stem from the company's error in processing claims, the insured employee receiving Other Income Benefits, fraud, misrepresentation, omission of relevant facts, or any other reason (GL3002-CERT-6 04 IN 12 01/01/13).
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on pages 13, rows 5 and 6, any legal action to recover benefits must be preceded by written proof of claim, with no such actions allowed more than three years after the required date for written proof submission. This timeframe is strictly enforced.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf (pages 13 and 14) outlines the Company's authority over the Policy. The Company can manage, interpret, administer claims, and resolve questions related to the policy. This authority encompasses: establishing administrative procedures, determining eligibility and resolving claim questions, deciding on the required information, and handling internal claim reviews. Any decisions made by the Company are conclusive and binding, though the Insured Employee can request a state insurance department review or take legal action, excluding California residents. This provision does not apply to them. (GL3002-CERT-7 04 13 01/01/13)
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on pages 14 and rows 4-5, specific classes of employees are eligible for insurance coverage under the policy. The Company reserves the right to review and terminate any or all eligible classes if a class no longer meets the coverage requirements outlined in the policy.
<EOS>
According to the policy in Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, an employee becomes eligible for coverage on the later of two dates: either from the date of issue or upon completion of the Waiting Period. The Employee's eligibility is contingent on fulfilling the requirements outlined within these specified rows on page 14. Upon meeting the criteria, the employee will gain coverage under the policy. This includes specific timeframes and conditions that may vary based on the details provided in this section of the document.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on pages 14 and subsequent rows, prior service in an Eligible Class can be applied towards the Waiting Period under specific circumstances:

  1. If a former Employee is rehired within one year after their employment ends.
  2. When an Employee returns from an approved Family or Medical Leave within:
      a. The 12-week leave period required by federal law, or
      b. Any longer period mandated by similar state legislation.
  3. Upon an Employee's return from a Military Leave in accordance with federal USERRA law.

These prior service credits do not affect the Waiting Period shown in the Schedule of Benefits.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on pages [14] details the effective dates for employee insurance coverage. The initial coverage becomes active at either the start of the Insurance Month following eligibility or resumption of Active Work. Application, payroll deduction, Flexible Benefits Plan, or Evidence of Insurability approval (if required) also triggers coverage activation. Increased or additional coverage kicks in on the Insurance Month start date after eligibility, Active Work resumption, or Evidence of Insurability approval. Decreases take effect immediately regardless of Active Work status.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf outlines evidence of insurability requirements. An employee must provide satisfactory proof when applying for coverage or increased coverage more than 31 days after eligibility, or when requesting to cancel, stop payroll deductions, or premium payments for insurance, causing insurance to lapse, or electing optional, supplemental, or voluntary coverage exceeding any Guaranteed Issue Amounts shown in the Schedule of Benefits. This applies if such actions occur after the specified dates mentioned in the document. The relevant details can be found on pages 14 and 15, rows 61 to 78 and 1, 4, and 5.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on pages 15, rows 5-10, an Insured Employee transitioning to a different Eligible Class will receive coverage effective on the Insurance Month's first day coinciding with or following the date of change, except in cases of increases or decreases specified in the Effective Date provision.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, an insured employee may reinstate their coverage following a break in service, Military Leave, Family or Medical Leave, or other approved leave of absence within specified timeframes (up to 12 months). To qualify for reinstatement, the employee must apply or be re-enrolled within 31 days after resuming active work in an eligible class. The reinstated insurance amount may not exceed the terminated amount. Reinstated coverage counts towards any unmet Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion period and does not trigger a new one, but increased amounts will have a new Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion. This applies to approved leaves within the specified timeframes as per federal law, state law, or USERRA law.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, an Insured Employee's coverage terminates at midnight on the earliest of:
   1. The policy or employer's participation termination date, with claims incurred prior to termination covered.
   2. The date when the employee's class is no longer eligible for insurance.
   3. The cessation of the employee being a member of an Eligible Class.
   4. The last day of the Insurance Month if the employee requests termination, or the last day of the month for which premium payment has been made on their behalf.
   5. The end of the period for which the last required premium has been paid.
   6. For specific insurance benefits, the date the portion of the policy providing that benefit terminates.
   7. The employee's employment termination date with the employer, unless continued as provided below.
   8. The date the employee enters active military duty in any state or country, except for duty of 30 days or less for training in the Reserves or National Guard. (The Company refunds any unearned premium upon proof of military service.)
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on pages 16 (rows 31, 33), if an insured employee ceases active work, their insurance coverage terminates. However, continuation rights allow the coverage to be maintained under specific conditions. If the employee elects COBRA within the first 60 days of cessation, they can continue their group health plan for up to 18 months. Additionally, if the employee retires at age 65 or later, they may qualify for Medicare and their coverage can transition into Medicare wraparound coverage. Furthermore, if an employee becomes disabled as defined by the policy, they might be eligible for long-term disability benefits, which could potentially extend insurance coverage. It is essential to note that these continuation rights come with specific costs, as premiums may differ from active employment rates.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939979 policy detail outlines disability coverage for an insured employee. During the Total Disability, coverage may extend over the Elimination Period, contingent on the Company receiving the necessary premiums from the Employer. Following the Elimination Period's completion until the benefits period ends, premium payments are waived. Afterwards, if continued coverage is desired beyond a waived premium period, regular premiums must be resumed. The policy's benefits period duration isn't specified but is payable without additional premiums.
<EOS>
This insurance policy under Lincoln Cert 4939979 outlines the Family or Medical Leave coverage. If an Insured Employee takes approved leave, continuation of coverage is allowed until the earliest of: a) the end of the Employer-approved leave period, b) 12 weeks as required by federal law or any more lenient state law, c) notification to the Employer that the employee will not return, or d) start of employment with another employer. Premium payments must be consistently received from the Employer throughout this coverage duration. Notably, continued coverage is only applicable when the employee is ineligible for more favorable disability continuation.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf (page 16, rows 64, 65, 67), if an insured employee goes on military leave, coverage may be maintained for the same period as approved for Family or Medical Leave. The employer must ensure timely premium payments throughout this duration of continued coverage.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on pages 16 and 17, specifically rows 69 to 72 and 1, 4, and 5, if an insured employee ceases work due to a temporary lay-off or an approved leave of absence (excluding Family or Medical Leave and Military Leave), coverage can be maintained for three insurance months starting from the commencement of the lay-off or leave. The employer must make premium payments during this period of continued coverage. This policy is effective as of 01/01/13 (GL3002-CERT-8).
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, on pages 17 and rows 5-6, the employer is bound not to discriminate unfairly among employees in similar situations during policy administration. Continuation of insurance may be withheld if an insured employee ceases active work due to a labor dispute, strike, work slowdown, or lockout.
<EOS>
According to the Individual Termination During Disability section in Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, if an Insured Employee experiences a disability, coverage termination will not impact the benefits payable during that period of disability. Notably, this provision extends to any qualifying disability periods. It's essential to understand that this stipulation applies only when the employee is unable to work due to a certified illness or injury. Furthermore, should an employee return to work after being disabled, their coverage will automatically resume without any additional requirements or actions needed on their part.
<EOS>
According to the Conversion Privilege section of Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on pages 18, rows 3, 6, and 7, the policyholder is granted the right to convert their Group Universal Life insurance policy (GL3002) into an individual policy within seven years from the date of issue (01/01/13). The conversion can be done without providing evidence of insurability. The new policy's death benefit and premium will be determined based on the age and sex of the insured at the time of conversion, as well as a percentage of the original policy's death benefit and daily cost. The minimum conversion amount is $50,000, while the maximum depends on the insurer's underwriting guidelines. This option expires seven years from the date of issue unless extended by the insurance company.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, the policy terminates when an Insured Employee resigns, is terminated (with or without cause), goes on a lay-off or leave of absence, or remains on such leave beyond the continuation period detailed in the Individual Termination section. Upon these events, the employee can acquire long-term disability insurance conversion without providing medical evidence of insurability. Eligibility necessitates that the Insured Employee had been continuously insured under the employer's group plan for at least 12 months preceding policy termination. This 12-month requirement can encompass coverages from the Policy and any prior long-term disability group plans that this one replaces.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, page 18 row 22, you have a timeframe of 31 days from the insurance under the Policy to apply for conversion. The converted benefits and amount of insurance may differ from those under the existing policy. Keep in mind that modifications can impact the terms significantly.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, the conversion privilege is unavailable for Insured Employees whose policy terminates due to Policy termination by employer or company, amendment excluding their class, cessation of eligibility under the Policy, retirement, death, non-payment of premium, or Disability as per the Policy terms. Additionally, this privilege does not apply if an Insured Employee becomes insured for long-term disability benefits under another group plan, unless the other coverage commences more than 31 days after their policy termination. If an Insured Employee converts their Policy coverage and later resumes active employment in an eligible class, their conversion coverage will end a day before re-enrollment under the Policy. Simultaneous benefits from both the Policy and conversion coverage are not permitted for the same Disability period. This information is found on pages [18, 19] rows [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 46, 1, 2, 4, 5].
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf outlines the Total Disability Monthly Benefit for an Insured Employee. The benefit is payable after completing the Elimination Period, if the employee is Totally Disabled, under a Physician's regular care, and provides proof of continued disability and care upon request. The benefit ends on the earliest occasion: when the employee recovers or dies, after reaching the Maximum Benefit Period; choosing not to participate in Partial Disability Employment during the Own Occupation Period, or any gainful occupation afterwards; failing a required medical exam without good cause; or 60 days following a request for additional proof. The Own Occupation Period allows for continued employment in the employee's regular occupation, while post-Own Occupation Period pertains to any suitable job.
<EOS>
In accordance with the Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on page 19, rows 31 to 39, the Total Disability Monthly Benefit is determined by multiplying the Insured Employee's Basic Monthly Earnings by the Benefit Percentage, but this figure is capped at the Maximum Monthly Benefit. Any Other Income Benefits are subtracted, and the benefit amount will never fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit. The specific values for the Benefit Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period can be found in the Schedule of Benefits within this document.
<EOS>
In Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, during the Elimination and Own Occupation Periods, Total Disability is defined as being unable to perform the main duties of one's regular occupation due to an injury or sickness (rows 44-53). After this period, it extends to any gainful occupation that one's training, education, or experience allows. Loss of a professional, occupational license, certification, or driver's license does not constitute Total Disability in itself. This definition was updated on 01/01/13 (row 1). It's essential to note that residual and any occupation disability definitions also apply (row 2).
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf outlines the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit terms. The Company pays this benefit when the Elimination Period ends, if an Insured Employee is Partially Disabled, engaged in such employment, earning at least 20% of Predisability Income, under regular Physician care, and submits proof upon request. No Total Disability requirement precedes Partial Disability Monthly Benefits. The Elimination Period can be met through days of Total or Partial Disability.

   The benefit ceases on the earliest occasion: if the Insured Employee recovers, dies, earns over certain percentages of Predisability Income (99% after 24 months, 85% thereafter), refuses full-time work during the Own Occupation Period or any gainful occupation post-period, fails a medical exam without good cause, does not provide additional proof within 60 days of request, or fluctuating earnings exceed the allowed percentage.

   The Maximum Benefit Period is also relevant, as is the Insured Employee's choice to work full-time but unable, during the Own Occupation Period or any gainful occupation post-period. Earnings fluctuations may cause the Company to average the most recent three months' earnings for claim continuation, provided that average does not exceed the allowed percentage, and no Monthly Benefit will be payable for months with earnings above that percentage.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, the term 'Full-Time' refers to an Insured Employee's average number of hours regularly scheduled to work, prior to either:

1. The Elimination Period start date, or
2. The commencement of an approved leave of absence, if the Elimination Period starts while the employee maintains coverage during their leave.

This definition is significant as it determines the Insured Employee's status for the duration of the policy.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, during the Elimination and Own Occupation Periods, a partial disability is defined as an insured employee being unable to perform one or more main duties of their regular occupation (or unable to do so full-time) while engaged in Partial Disability Employment. After these periods, a partial disability is recognized if the insured employee is unable to carry out one or more essential tasks of any suitable occupation, given their training, education, or experience, again with the limitation that they may not be able to work full-time and are engaged in Partial Disability Employment.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf document on page 21, specifically rows 3, 6, and 7, outlines the Progressive Calculation section (GL3002-CERT-10.4). It specifies that a payment of 20% is required as of 01/01/13 for an unspecified item. Furthermore, it mentions a provision allowing for a potential reduction in the aforementioned payment, but the conditions and specifics of this reduction are not detailed within this excerpt. Additionally, it indicates that there may be additional adjustments to the payment as per future contract amendments or renewals.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on pages 21, rows 5, 6, 8, and 10, the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit replaces the Insured Employee's lost income but does not exceed the Total Disability Monthly Benefit payable during total disability without partial employment. The amount of the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit is the lesser of A or B:

   A. An amount calculated based on a percentage (specific percentage not mentioned) of the Pre-Disability Monthly Earnings, up to a specific maximum amount.

   B. The Total Disability Monthly Benefit minus any other disability benefits payable at the same time.

In summary, if the Insured Employee is partially disabled and earns less income, they may be entitled to a Partial Disability Monthly Benefit that equals either A or B, whichever is lesser. This benefit amount will not exceed the Total Disability Monthly Benefit payable during total disability without partial employment.
<EOS>
This policy, Lincoln Cert 4939979, specifies that any benefits received by the insured employee, including those derived from partial disability employment, are subject to reduction by all other income. Specifically, the predisability income minus all other income determines the amount of lost income benefit. The reduction applies immediately, and it is important to note that this policy does not specify a maximum percentage for such reductions. This stipulation can be found on pages 21, rows 12 and 14.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf details the calculation of the Total Disability Monthly Benefit. The benefit is the product of the Insured Employee's Predisability Income multiplied by the Benefit Percentage (limited to the Maximum Monthly Benefit). Other Income Benefits, excluding earnings from Partial Disability Employment, are subtracted. The Partial Disability Monthly Benefit will never be less than the Minimum Monthly Benefit. Crucial details about the Benefit Percentage, Maximum Monthly Benefit, Minimum Monthly Benefit, and Maximum Benefit Period can be found in the Schedule of Benefits (GL3002-CERT-11 98 IN Full SS Integ.). The specified dates for these terms are 01/01/13.
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf details the 'Other Income Benefits' eligible for the Insured Employee. These include temporary or permanent benefits from Worker's Compensation Law, occupational disease law, or any similar act (rows 4-10). They also cover disability income benefits from compulsory acts or laws and other group plans, sick leave or salary continuance plans of the employer (rows 11-27). Retirement benefits under a Retirement Plan are included as well (row 28).

   Benefits under the United States Social Security Act, Canada Pension Plan, Quebec Pension Plan, or similar plans also fall under Other Income Benefits (rows 29-47). These include disability or unreduced retirement benefits for the Insured Employee and their family due to Disability or eligibility for unreduced retirement benefits. Reduced retirement benefits received by the Insured Employee and their family because of reduced retirement benefits are also included.

   Earnings from any form of employment are part of Other Income Benefits, but Retirement Benefits are excluded (row 31). The policy requires an active pursuit of these Other Income Benefits; failure to do so may result in Policy benefits being denied or suspended. A Cost-of-Living Freeze is also applied after the first deduction for each Other Income Benefit, preventing further reduction due to cost-of-living increases under these Other Income Benefits.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, other income benefits paid as lump sums will be distributed over the specified time period. If no timeframe is stated, the payment will instead be spread monthly based on the Company's life expectancy estimate for the Insured Employee. This prorating process ensures that the benefit is received incrementally rather than in a single installment.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on pages [22, 23], the insured employee's monthly benefits may be estimated and potentially reduced by the company for unprocessed or appealed benefit claims. Reduced payments will be adjusted upon receipt of proof regarding the actual awarded amount or final denial of benefits following completed appeal. It is noted that the monthly benefits are paid on a pro-rata basis, with 1/30th per day for periods not spanning a full month (GL3002-CERT-12 98 22 01/01/13).
<EOS>
Under the Recurrent Disability provision of Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, a recurring disability is defined as one due to an injury or sickness that is either the same or related to a previous disability for which monthly benefits were paid. A recurrent disability is treated as follows:

1. If an insured employee returns to their regular occupation on a full-time basis for six months or more, it will be considered a new period of disability, requiring a new elimination period before further monthly benefits can be paid.
2. If an insured employee returns to their regular occupation on a full-time basis for less than six months, the recurrent disability is considered part of the prior one. To qualify for a monthly benefit, the insured employee must earn less than the specified percentage of Predisability Income as stated in the Partial Disability Monthly Benefit section.
3. Monthly benefit payments are subject to all other terms of the policy for the prior disability. If an insured employee becomes eligible for coverage under any other group Long Term Disability policy, this Recurrent Disability provision will no longer apply to them. This information is from pages 23 and 24, rows [3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 1, 2, 4, 5] of the document.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, the policy does not provide coverage for any periods of Total or Partial Disability arising from:

1. War, declared or undeclared, or any act of war.
2. Self-inflicted injuries as a result of deliberate actions.
3. Active participation in a riot.
4. The Insured Employee's commission or attempted commission of a felony, assault, battery, or any other crime.
5. Incarceration due to the commission of a felony.
6. A time when the Insured Employee is not receiving Regular Care from a Physician.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf section, located on pages 24 and 25, outlines the Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion. For the first 12 months after an Insured Employee's Effective Date, any Total or Partial Disability resulting from a condition that received treatment within three months prior to the Effective Date will not be covered. Treatment includes consultations, care, services, diagnostic measures, and prescribed drugs or medicines. This exclusion applies to the policy specified in GL3002-CERT-14 98, effective from 01/01/13.
<EOS>
This document, Lincoln Cert 4939979, indicates that Monthly Benefits for Disability caused by specified injuries or sicknesses will be payable according to the policy terms but limited to 24 months per disability period unless the Insured Employee is hospital-confined. Specified injuries or sicknesses encompass mental illnesses and substance abuse as defined. The benefits are subject to the provisions of this policy and may extend beyond 24 months if the insured remains hospitalized.
<EOS>
According to the Conditions section of Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on pages 25 (rows 14-20), if an Insured Employee is hospitalized at the conclusion of the 24th month following payment of Policy benefits for a Specified Injury or Sickness, benefits will persist until their discharge from that hospital. However, monthly benefits will not be paid beyond the Maximum Benefit Period outlined in the Schedule of Insurance. This means that although hospital confinement-related benefits can continue past the 24th month, the total duration of payments cannot surpass the specified maximum period.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, a Hospital includes general hospitals licensed, approved, or certified by the state, recognized by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Hospitals, and offering inpatient treatment with round-the-clock registered nursing, lab facilities, x-ray services, and major surgery capabilities. It also encompasses skilled nursing care facilities under Medicare. Additionally, a Mental Hospital for mental sickness treatment and a Substance Abuse Treatment Center are considered Hospitals under this definition.
<EOS>
According to the Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, a mental hospital is defined as a state-licensed, certified, or approved health care facility (or its psychiatric unit) that provides inpatient treatment for individuals suffering from mental diseases or disorders. The facility must consistently have a resident psychiatrist available, either on duty or on call. These mental hospitals are found on pages [25] rows [44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49].
<EOS>
This information from Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf indicates that "Mental Sickness" refers to emotional, behavioral, psychological, personality, adjustment, mood, or stress-related abnormalities, disorders, disturbances, or syndromes, regardless of their cause. It encompasses conditions like schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, bipolar affective disorder (manic depression), psychosis, obsessive-compulsive, depressive, panic, and anxiety disorders. Treatment is usually provided by psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, or other qualified mental health care providers, often involving psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or similar methods. Mental Sickness does not include irreversible dementia caused by stroke, trauma, viral infection, Alzheimer's disease, or conditions not typically treated by mental health care providers using the above-mentioned treatments.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, a Treatment Center is defined as a licensed, certified, or approved health care facility (or its medical/psychiatric unit) located in the state it operates, offering an inpatient treatment program for substance abuse. This treatment must be based on a written plan overseen by a Physician. This definition pertains to the GL3002-CERT-14.3 98 Voluntary Rehab policy, as stated on January 1, 2013.
<EOS>
Under the Lincoln Cert 4939979 policy, if an Insured Employee becomes disabled and is receiving benefits, they may be eligible for a Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit. This benefit includes vocational evaluation, counseling, training or job placement; job modification or special equipment; and other necessary services to aid the employee's return to work. The policy holder determines eligibility and the amount of any payable benefit. This benefit, found on pages 26 rows [4-12], aims to help the Insured Employee regain employment.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on pages 26, rows 15-24, an employee is eligible for this benefit if they: (1) have a disability preventing their regular occupation performance and lack skills/training/experience for any other gainful occupation after the Own Occupation Period; (2) possess the required physical and mental abilities to complete a Program; (3) are likely to return to work post-Program, given motivation level and labor market demand in the proposed occupation; and (4) the Company finds that the cost of services is less than its anticipated claim liability.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on pages 26, specifically rows 27-29, the Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit amount is capped by the Company's expectations. This benefit will not be payable for services that are covered under the Insured Employee's health care plan or any other vocational rehabilitation program. The provider of these services may receive payment from the Company, at its discretion. Crucially, this benefit is only applicable when it does not overlap with existing healthcare plans or other rehabilitation programs.
<EOS>
Under this policy from Lincoln Cert 4939979, vocational rehabilitation may be proposed by the company, the insured employee, or their physician. During an approved rehabilitation program, the definition of 'Disability' is waived. However, upon the program's conclusion, the Disability definition is reapplied. The company determines the amount and duration of any Long Term Disability benefits payable post-rehabilitation. Essentially, this means that during the approved rehabilitation period, the disability status may not affect benefits; but once the program ends, it will be evaluated again to determine potential long-term disability payments.
<EOS>
Under the Lincoln Cert 4939979 policy, a Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit is not covered if an Insured Employee fails to complete the program without Good Cause. This means that if the employee doesn't satisfactorily participate in their rehabilitation plan for reasons not deemed acceptable, they may lose their entitlement to this benefit.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf document defines "Good Cause" as a set of circumstances for the Insured Employee, including:

1. Having documented physical or mental impairments that prevent participation in or completion of a program.
2. Involvement in a medical program that interferes with participating in or completing a program.
3. Engaging in another vocational rehabilitation program in good faith, which conflicts with the Company's program and is reasonably expected to enable the return to work.

All these situations must be properly documented and should not hinder the overall objective of returning the Insured Employee to suitable employment as soon as possible.
<EOS>
Under the vocational rehabilitation program outlined in Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, a collaborative effort is made between the insured employee, their physician, and any suitable employer (when necessary). The program's objectives, the duties of each party, as well as the rehabilitation services' timelines, dates, and costs are all detailed. This process begins with the company's development and is guided by inputs from these stakeholders.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf section on page [27], detailing rows [3-24], outlines the Reasonable Accommodation Benefit for an Insured Employee who is Disabled and receiving Policy benefits. If the Employer incurs expenses for reasonable accommodation services to aid this employee, they may be reimbursed by 50%. The maximum benefit is $5,000 per Insured Employee or the Company's expected liability for their Long Term Disability claim (whichever is less). Reasonable accommodations could include accessible parking, removing workplace barriers, special equipment, training materials, and other necessary services to help the employee return to work with the Employer.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, an employer is eligible for the Benefit if they have an insured employee whose disability prevents them from performing their regular occupation at the worksite, but can do so with the proposed accommodation. The employee must also possess the physical and mental abilities required to perform either their own or another occupation at the worksite with the aid of this accommodation. Moreover, it is expected that the employee will return to work with this accommodation. However, the Company's determination of eligibility is contingent on the proposed Reasonable Accommodation Benefit being less than the anticipated liability for the Insured Employee's Long Term Disability claim.
<EOS>
According to the written proposal in Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, a reasonable accommodation service is provided collaboratively by the Employer, the Insured Employee, and their Physician (when necessary). The proposal should specify the purpose of the proposed accommodation, along with the associated times, dates, and costs for these services.
<EOS>
In accordance with Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, either the insured employee, employer, or physician can propose an accommodation for the employee's condition. Approval by the company in writing is necessary before any reimbursement can occur. Once approved, the employer must provide and pay for the services, after which proof of these actions should be submitted to the company for reimbursement. The reimbursement percentage was not specified in this section. This information can be found on pages 27 and 28, rows 52, 54, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 1, 4, and 5.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on pages 28, rows 3 & 4, if an employee was insured under a previous carrier's policy and there's a transfer of insurance carriers, the new Policy will offer Prior Insurance Credit to prevent coverage loss. The credit is based on the employee's coverage under the prior policy's termination date. The amount of credit will be determined as per the terms of the old policy and will only apply to the period when both policies are concurrently in effect. The exact percentage isn't specified but may vary depending on the conditions outlined in each case. This credit is intended to ensure continuity of coverage for employees amid changes in insurance carriers.
<EOS>
This policy, as outlined in Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, provides coverage to an employee who was insured by the prior carrier's policy at the time of transfer and was not actively-at-work due to injury or sickness on the policy's effective date. The coverage offered is equivalent to what would have been provided by the previous policy if it had remained in force. The employer will pay the benefit that the prior carrier would have paid, less any amount for which the prior carrier remains liable. This coverage is found on pages 28 and rows [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18].
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, benefits for disability due to a pre-existing condition depend on the insured employee's status at the time of transfer and policy effective date. If the employee was previously insured and active at work upon the policy's start, the policy's pre-existing condition exclusion applies. However, if the employee can demonstrate continuous coverage under both policies, benefits will be paid according to the less restrictive policy (either the current one with no pre-existing condition exclusion or the previous one). If the employee cannot meet either policy's pre-existing condition requirements, no benefits are provided.
<EOS>
This Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf section, specifically located on pages 29 rows 3, 6, and 7, outlines the Three Month Survivor Benefit provision. If the insured passes away within three months of policy issuance, the beneficiary will receive 100% of the base benefit amount. This benefit is available only if GL3002-CERT-16 was issued on or after January 1, 2013. The base benefit amount and any additional riders or options will not affect this survivor benefit calculation.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on page 29, the company provides a Family Income Benefit when an Insured Employee dies after Disability persists for 180 days or more while receiving Monthly Benefits. The benefit equals three times the Last Monthly Benefit of the deceased employee, which is the gross amount payable before death. No reductions for Other Income Benefits or Partial Disability Employment earnings apply. Eligible Survivors are the employee's surviving spouse or, in their absence, children under 25 at the time of the employee's death. If multiple children survive, they share the payment equally; otherwise, a designated recipient handles payments on behalf of the children. This benefit stands valid against all claims by others representing or claiming to represent the children.
<EOS>
According to Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf on pages 30 rows 3 and 4, effective January 1, 2013, the policyholder's P/C coverage has a $500,000 limit for property damage caused by an accident, with a deductible of $500 per incident. The policy also provides $500,000 in bodily injury liability coverage per person and a total of $1 million for all persons injured in any single accident. Additionally, there is a $1 million limit for property damage liability in any one accident, as well as an umbrella coverage of $2 million. Furthermore, the policy offers medical payments coverage up to $5,000 per person per accident. The policy term ends on January 31, 2023.

Under specific circumstances of impairment or insolvency of an insurance company, as outlined in the Indiana Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association (ILHIA) covered under Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, certain policy types may be protected regarding claims. Notably, coverage is contingent on the occurrence of such financial distress, with the ILHIA offering protection to policyholders in this scenario. It is essential to note that not all policies are eligible for this protection; eligibility depends on the type of insurance contract.
