According to Unum Policy 4702860, all active US employees of the employer are eligible for coverage under the specified policy. This encompasses every worker in an active employment status within the United States as the employer. No specific timeframe or percentage was explicitly stated regarding eligibility requirements. However, it's essential to maintain continuous employment with the employer to ensure continued coverage.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860, employees must work a minimum of 30 hours per week to be eligible for insurance coverage. This means that if an employee works fewer than 30 hours weekly, they may not qualify for the benefits offered under this policy.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, the waiting period for disability benefits varies based on the date of employment eligibility. For employees who were part of an eligible group before June 1, 2005, the waiting period is the first month coinciding or immediately following 90 days of continuous active employment. Conversely, employees joining an eligible group after June 1, 2005, must also wait for the first month coinciding or following 90 days of continuous active employment to receive benefits.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, if your employment terminates and you are rehired within a year, the waiting period for benefits is waived based on your previous work while in an eligible group. All other policy provisions apply. This means that if you meet these criteria and return to work within 12 months, you can bypass the waiting period when it comes to reapplying for benefits at a later time.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, your employer bears the cost of coverage. The policy states that your employer is responsible for payment, as specified in the contract between you and your employer. This arrangement remains in effect until any alteration or termination occurs in accordance with the policy's terms. However, it's essential to note that additional details regarding contribution percentages, eligibility requirements, or applicable deductibles may be found within the policy itself.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, the elimination period lasts for 180 days. Benefits will commence once this period is over, starting on the day following its completion. This means that if you are eligible and submit a valid claim during this period, you will receive benefits from the day after the 180-day mark has been reached. This waiting period may seem long, but it helps ensure that benefits are provided only when necessary, as per policy requirements.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, Physicians and Administrative Officers receive 60% of their monthly earnings, capped at $15,000 per month.

According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf on page 5, row 53, the policy guarantees Continuity of Coverage. This means that as long as you meet certain conditions and make timely payments, your coverage will continue without interruption, even if you develop a health condition during the initial underwriting period or when reapplying for coverage after an earlier lapse. The policy requires that you maintain continuous coverage, and any break in coverage lasting more than 63 days may result in a new underwriting evaluation at the standard rates applicable to your then-current age. Furthermore, there is no restriction on the number of times you can reapply for coverage following a break in coverage, but each subsequent application will be subject to new underwriting guidelines and may result in higher premiums based on your current health status.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf on page 5, row 57, a pre-existing condition will be considered if it has been symptomatic or treated within the past 12 months (3/12).

According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, it is essential to notify Unum of a disability claim as soon as possible. Written notice should ideally be sent within 30 days following the onset of disability. Proof of the claim must be provided no later than 90 days after your elimination period, or up to one year if unable to provide it earlier. The claim form can be obtained from your employer or requested from Unum. If the form is not received within 15 days of a request, send written proof of the claim without delay. Immediate notification is required upon returning to work in any capacity.
<EOS>
To file a claim under Unum Policy 4702860, both you and your employer are required to fill out the respective sections of the claim form. Once completed, provide the form to your attending physician who should then fill out their section and submit it directly to Unum for processing.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, your disability claim proof must establish regular physician care, monthly earnings, disability onset date, cause, extent (with restrictions and limitations preventing work), hospital or institutional treatment details including physicians, and may require ongoing medical and non-medical information. Proof of continuing disability must be submitted within 45 days if requested, and Unum reserves the right to obtain additional information.

According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf (6/1/2005) REV 1, payments under LTD-CLM will be made directly to you. This policy specifies that Unum will make these payments should you become disabled and are unable to work, as per the terms of your contract.

These payments will continue until you either return to work or reach the policy's maximum benefit period, which extends up to age 65.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, the recipient is obligated to reimburse any overpayments resulting from fraud, errors in claim processing, or receipt of deductible sources of income. Repayment methods will be decided by Unum, and they will not exceed the amount overpaid. It is crucial to note that Unum will not recover more money than the overpaid amount.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf on pages 8, rows 3 and 4, the initial premium for each long-term disability plan is determined by the rates shown in the Rate Information Amendment(s). The premium amount can vary based on factors such as age, gender, occupation, and benefit level chosen. The policy includes a Nonforfeiture Option, which allows for a reduced benefit payment if the policyholder fails to pay the premium. The policy also specifies that the premium remains constant throughout the term of the policy unless there is a rate increase due to plan amendments or changes in state regulations. Additionally, the policy requires evidence of insurability upon application and during the conversion period, ensuring the coverage is appropriate for the policyholder's health status. Furthermore, it's essential to note that the elimination period starts on the date the disability begins and can range from 30 days up to six months.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, premium payments are waived for the policyholder while they receive Long Term Disability benefits. This waiver applies during the period of disability-related payment receipt. The policy does not specify an end date for this waiver, suggesting it may persist as long as the recipient continues to meet eligibility requirements for LTD payments. It's important to note that this policy provision only pertains to premium payments, and any other obligations or conditions stipulated elsewhere in the policy remain applicable.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, on page 8, row 13, premium rates may change based on the Rate Information Amendment(s). The policy guarantees the initial rate for a specific period, typically six or twelve months, and any changes will be communicated in writing with at least 30 days' notice prior to implementation. If there is an increase greater than 10%, the policyholder may terminate their coverage without penalty within 60 days of receiving the rate change notification.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, premium due dates for this policy are determined by the Premium Due Dates outlined in the Rate Information Amendment(s). The Policyholder must ensure that all premium payments reach Unum on or before their designated due date. These payments should be made in United States dollars.
<EOS>
Premium adjustments in Unum Policy 4702860, as detailed on pages [8], take effect from the policy month and are due on the subsequent premium due date. Such changes will not be prorated daily, but monthly if premiums are not paid monthly. In case of fraud, premium adjustments span all policy years. For monthly payments, premium alterations result in a monthly pro-rated adjustment on the following premium due date. Unum only makes premium adjustments for the current and prior policy year; however, should fraud occur, changes will be made across all policy years.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, the policyholder is required to regularly provide information about eligible employees, changes in coverage amounts, and termination of coverage. Additionally, occupational information and any other necessary claim-management data should be submitted. Unum may request additional information deemed reasonable. The policyholder's records related to this policy will be available for review at any convenient time by Unum.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, any clerical error or omission by Unum will not prevent an employee from obtaining coverage, impact the amount of insurance coverage, or cause coverage to start or persist if it would not have been effective otherwise (as detailed on page [9] rows [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]). Essentially, technical mistakes do not affect eligibility, coverage levels, or coverage duration.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, both the insurer (Unum) and the policyholder can cancel or modify this insurance policy or a plan under it. Reasons for cancellation or modification include: inadequate participation among eligible employees, failure to provide required information, non-compliance with obligations, a small number of insured employees, late premium payments, changes in the size, occupation, or age of the eligible group due to corporate transactions, and late payment of premium portions during the 31-day grace period. If cancellation is not due to premium default, a 31-day written notice will be provided. The policyholder may cancel the policy if modifications are unacceptable, but must give at least 31 days' notice. Upon cancellation, coverage ends at midnight on the last day of coverage, and the cancellation does not affect payable claims. Premiums for coverage during the grace period remain the policyholder's responsibility.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, if an employee is on a family and medical leave of absence, coverage will continue based on the policyholder's human resource policies. Premium payments must be made, and the policyholder's approval in writing is required for the leave. Coverage extends until the end of the longer of: 1) the leave period required by the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and any amendments; or 2) the leave period mandated by state law. In instances where the policyholder's policies do not offer continuation during a family and medical leave, coverage will resume upon return to active employment. The company will not apply a new waiting period, pre-existing conditions exclusion, or require evidence of insurability during this time.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliated companies are included within the scope of this policy. Specifically, these entities must comply with all terms and conditions stated herein. They are defined as legal entities with a significant connection, such as common ownership, management control, or operational integration, with Unum Group or its designated affiliates. This connection extends to companies located in various cities and states across the United States. For instance, it includes entities based in Portland, Maine and Chattanooga, Tennessee. The extent of their inclusion is not limited by geography; they can be present in multiple locations. The degree of control or ownership required for a company's classification as an affiliate is not explicitly stated within this section. However, the common thread that binds them all is a close relationship with Unum Group.

According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, section CC.FP-1 (revision 1) on page 11 row 2, the policy outlines that if an employee becomes disabled and is receiving both Short-Term Disability (STD) benefits and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), Unum will reduce the STD payment by up to 50% once SSDI benefits exceed a certain amount. This reduction applies only after the employee has received STD benefits for 24 months. The policy further states that if an employee is also receiving Workers' Compensation, Unum will continue to provide benefits until the earlier of the end of the Workers' Compensation period or the end of the 24-month STD benefit period. This reduction in STD benefits does not apply if the SSDI payment is due solely to a condition unrelated to the disability for which the employee is receiving STD benefits. The policy also mentions that if an employee's SSDI benefits terminate, their STD benefits will resume at the full amount, subject to any applicable deductions and waiting periods.

According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf on pages 12, rows 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6, the certificate of coverage is a document prepared by Unum. It outlines the coverage you may be eligible for, the recipients of payments from Unum, and any limitations, exclusions, and requirements within the plan. Critical aspects to note include specific terms, payment destinations, and restrictions applicable to your policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, eligibility for coverage occurs when you are employed by your group's eligible employer. The effective date of coverage is either the plan's start date or the day following the completion of your waiting period. These terms and conditions can be found on pages 12, rows 1, 2, 4, and 5 of the policy document.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, coverage begins at 12:01 a.m. on the date you are eligible for insurance. If your employer covers the full cost, coverage starts on this date. If the cost is shared or you pay in full, coverage begins either on the date of eligibility if you apply on time, within 31 days after eligibility, or when Unum approves your application (if evidence of insurability is required). This evidence is needed if you're a late applicant or reapplying after voluntarily cancelling coverage. The evidence form can be obtained from your employer. Eligibility dates are crucial; failure to apply within 31 days may require evidence, which could delay your coverage start.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf on pages 12, row 1-2, if you are unable to work due to injury, sickness, temporary layoff, or leave of absence, your insurance coverage will only commence upon your return to active employment.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf on pages 12, rows 1-3, if an employee experiences a temporary layoff and timely premium payments are maintained, coverage will extend through the month immediately following the one in which the layoff begins. This policy does not specify further coverage details for subsequent months should the layoff persist.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, during a leave of absence, if premium payments are made, the coverage continues through the month that immediately succeeds the month your leave commences. This provision applies from June 1st, 2005 (Revision 1).
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860 on page 13 rows 1-8, any increase or additional coverage commences immediately if you're employed actively, on a covered layoff, or leave. However, if your absence is due to injury or illness, the added coverage begins upon your return to active employment. Conversely, any decrease in coverage takes effect promptly but does not impact a claim already in progress prior to the reduction.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, your coverage terminates upon the earliest of: cancellation of the policy or plan, your removal from an eligible group, cessation of coverage for your group, the end of any required contribution periods, or the day you cease active employment (except during covered layoff or leave). Notably, Unum will provide coverage for claims submitted during the period when you are covered under the policy or plan.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, legal action on your claim can be initiated within 60 days following the submission of proof of claim or up to 3 years from the required date for providing proof of claim, except where federal law provides otherwise.

<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860 on page 13 (rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15), any statements made in a signed application for coverage are considered representations, not warranties. If these statements are found to be incomplete or untrue at the time they're made, Unum may either reduce or deny a claim, or cancel coverage from the original effective date. Only statements in a signed application will be used as a basis for this action. Incorrect information provided by the Employer will be utilized to decide coverage and premium amounts, with a fair adjustment of the premium made accordingly.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf on page 14, rows [1-11], Unum vows to combat insurance fraud by employing all feasible methods for detection, investigation, and prosecution. It is unlawful to intentionally mislead, deceive, or defraud Unum with false, incomplete, or misleading information when filing a claim. Acts of insurance fraud may result in denied claims, legal action, and punishment under state and federal laws. In cases of fraud, Unum will pursue legal remedies to the fullest extent possible.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, it is stated that any workers' compensation or state disability insurance coverage requirements are neither replaced nor affected by this policy. This implies that concurrent benefits may be claimable if eligible for both this insurance and such statutory disability programs.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, your employer represents either itself or you in relation to the policy. Under no circumstances will they act as an agent for Unum. This policy update was made on June 1st, 2005, with revisions included (REV 1).
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, disability is defined as a limitation from performing the material and substantial duties of your regular occupation due to sickness or injury, accompanied by a 20% or more loss in indexed monthly earnings. For employees eligible under all groups, this applies after 24 months of payments when you are unable to perform the duties of any gainful occupation for which you are reasonably fitted by education, training or experience. Regular physician care is required, and Unum has the right to examine you by a physician, medical practitioner, or vocational expert at their discretion. Examinations can occur as often as deemed necessary, and interviews with an authorized Unum Representative may also be required. This policy was revised on 6/1/2005 (LTD-BEN-2).
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, if you qualify for benefits under items 1, 2, or 3 in the deductible sources of income section and these benefits have not been awarded, denied, or are being appealed, your Long Term Disability payment may be reduced by the estimated amount. However, if you apply for these disability payments, appeal any denials to all necessary administrative levels, and sign Unum's payment option form promising to repay any overpayment caused by an award, your Long Term Disability payment will not be reduced.

Upon receiving proof of awarded benefits or completion of all necessary appeals if benefits have been denied, your payment will be adjusted, and you may receive a lump sum refund of the estimated amount. Any lump sum received from deductible sources of income will be pro-rated over a reasonable time period if no time period is stated. If your Long Term Disability payment has been reduced by an estimated amount, it will be reinstated once proof or completion of necessary appeals is provided. The policy was revised on June 1, 2005.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, if you're disabled while employed, your disability days will contribute to your elimination period. This means that the time you spend unable to work due to disability, even if you're still earning an income, is accounted for in meeting the required duration before benefits are activated. The number of days needed for this elimination period may vary based on the specific policy terms.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, payments will be issued once your claim is approved, contingent upon meeting the elimination period and if you are deemed disabled. The payment schedule is monthly for any duration that Unum is responsible for.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, payments for disability are determined by physicians and administrative officers. If you're disabled, they will consider your regular monthly earnings (excluding overtime and bonuses) during the base period - the first 52 weeks prior to your disability start date. The base earnings can be up to $12,086 per month. Your payment is calculated as a percentage of these base earnings: for Short-Term Disability (STD), it's 60%, and for Long-Term Disability (LTD), it's 60% for the first 24 months then 45% thereafter. These percentages may differ based on your specific policy. Payments will be made monthly and can continue until you reach the maximum benefit period stated in your policy or until you return to work, whichever comes first.

In accordance with Unum Policy 4702860, page 16, row 16, the monthly disability benefit amount you receive will be determined by comparing the answer from Item 1 (specified in the policy) to the maximum monthly benefit. The lesser of these two figures constitutes your gross disability payment. It is essential to remember that any deductions for applicable taxes and prior payments could further affect the actual amount you receive. Furthermore, it is crucial to review this information carefully as it may impact your financial situation during a period of disability.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4702860, your monthly payment (Item 4) is determined. Importantly, this payment is subject to deductions for any sources of income that may be available to you during your disability period. This means the amount you receive will be reduced by any earnings or benefits you are eligible for from other sources. It's essential to report all such income promptly to ensure an accurate calculation of your disability benefit. Keep in mind, this policy is subject to specific terms and conditions that may affect your payment, so it's advisable to carefully review the entire document.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, the total monthly benefit received from this plan will not surpass 100% of your earnings, regardless of any other benefits provided. If you participate in Unum's Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program, this limit is raised to 110%. These percentages are effective as of June 1, 2005, with revisions made once.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, the term "Monthly Earnings" refers to your pre-tax income from employment during the calendar year preceding your disability, as stated in the income box on your W-2 form or calculated based on your earnings if a W-2 wasn't available. This figure includes wages, tips, and other compensations but excludes contributions to a qualified deferred compensation plan, Section 125 plan, flexible spending account, car allowances, housing allowances, moving allowances, Employer contributions to a deferred compensation plan, or income from sources other than your employer. The average gross monthly income is the total income before taxes.
<EOS>
During a covered layoff or leave of absence as outlined in Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, if you become disabled, your monthly earnings from your employer effective immediately prior to the start of your absence will be used for disability benefit calculations.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, if you become disabled due to the same sickness or injury and your monthly disability earnings are less than 20% of your indexed monthly earnings, Unum will send a monthly payment. If your disability earnings range between 20% and 80% of your indexed monthly earnings, Unum will pay a monthly amount based on the condition that during the initial 12 months while working, the combined total (disability earnings plus gross disability payment) does not surpass 100% of the indexed monthly earnings. This means that your payment won't be reduced as long as this combined total remains below the threshold.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, if the answer from Item 1 is equal to or less than 100% of your indexed monthly earnings, no further reduction in your monthly payment will occur. Conversely, if the answer exceeds 100%, the excess percentage is subtracted from your monthly payment. After a year of payments while working, you become eligible for payments proportional to the disability-related income loss percentage. This policy is outlined on pages 17, rows 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, and 23.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, if you file a Long-Term Disability (LTD) claim under the LTD-BEN-4 plan (revised 2005), your disability earnings will be subtracted from your indexed monthly earnings for benefits calculation. Specifically, the policy states that the total of your indexed monthly earnings and any concurrent state disability payments will first be determined; then, your LTD benefit amount will be 60% of the remaining sum. This policy is effective as of June 1st, 2005.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, section 2 at row 2 on page 18, the benefit you receive is a percentage of your lost earnings. To determine this, your total benefit is divided by your indexed monthly earnings. This policy's specific terms and conditions apply if you become disabled and are unable to work as outlined in the policy. The exact percentage of your lost earnings that the policy will provide may vary depending on individual circumstances, as defined within the policy terms.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 4702860.pdfs' specified rows on page 18, your monthly disability payment is determined and may necessitate quarterly proof of earnings. The payment adjusts based on this quarterly income. Financial records may be requested to substantiate your income, deemed necessary by Unum. After the elimination period, if you are disabled for less than a month, you receive 1/30 of your monthly payment for each day of disability.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, if your disability earnings fluctuate significantly from month to month, the policy may average your earnings over the last three months to decide whether your claim should continue. Your claim will not be terminated unless the 3-month average of your disability earnings surpasses 80% of indexed monthly earnings. If this occurs, you will not receive payment for any such month. In these instances, the policy does not pay you during months where your disability earnings exceed 80% of your indexed monthly earnings.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, certain income sources may be deducted from your gross disability payment. These include worker's compensation, Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), and other private or governmental long-term disability benefits. The amount deducted will depend on the nature of these additional income sources. For instance, if you receive SSDI, Unum will subtract 85% of the SSDI payment from your disability payment. If you receive a combination of worker's compensation and SSDI, Unum will reduce your disability payment by 60% of the total combined amount received. The percentages may vary based on the specific income source. These deductions start once both the SSDI or worker's compensation benefits begin.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf at pages 18, rows 6-8, the benefits you may receive are determined by a combination of workers' compensation laws, occupational disease laws, and any other relevant legislation with similar intent. The total disability benefit will equal 2% of your average monthly earnings for each full year or portion thereof during which you were continuously disabled, up to a maximum of 60% of your pre-disability average monthly earnings. Benefits are payable from the date of disability and continue until the earlier of your return to work or the 24th month following your disability onset, unless an extension is granted due to inability to return to any suitable gainful occupation. Any benefits received under a workers' compensation or similar statute will be offset against the policy benefit.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, any disability income payments derived from state compulsory benefit acts or laws, other group insurance plans, or governmental retirement systems associated with your employer are not subject to the policy's benefits. Specifically, if you receive such payments following your employment with the stated employer, they will be offset against the disability income provided under this policy. This exclusion is effective from the benefit start date.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, pages 18 and 19, row numbers 18, 20-22, and 2, 1, your disability payments from the United States Social Security Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the Quebec Pension Plan, or any similar plan or act will not affect your benefits under this policy. These payments are subject to the provisions of LTD-BEN-5 (6/1/2005) REV 1. In case of a conflict between this policy and the aforementioned plans, the terms of these programs shall prevail.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf (page 19, rows 4-10), if you receive retirement payments under the United States Social Security Act, Canada Pension Plan, Quebec Pension Plan, or any similar plan or act, your children's benefits will be reduced proportionally. This adjustment is based on the amount of retirement income you receive, which may impact their payments until they reach age 18 (or up to age 22 if a full-time student). The reduction percentage depends on the specific plan. It's essential to note that this policy applies to both spousal and child benefits. Additionally, no reductions will be made if you are receiving retirement payments from any other group or individual disability income policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, disability payments received under your employer's retirement plan are defined as benefits paid due to disability and do not affect the future retirement benefit. These payments can be elected voluntarily or occur when you reach the later of age 62 or normal retirement age as defined in your employer's plan. Unum will consider both yours and your employer's contributions to the retirement plan to be distributed simultaneously throughout your lifetime, with exception to amounts rolled over or transferred to an eligible retirement plan under IRC Section 402. The definition of eligible retirement plan includes any future amendments affecting the definition.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 4702860.pdf on pages 19 and specific rows 38, 40, 41, 43, 44, and 45, your disability benefits will be reduced only by nondisability income sources. This excludes Social Security retirement income if your disability occurs past age 65, even if you were already receiving such benefits. Additionally, the policy specifies that retirement payments are not subject to reduction. These rules apply under the Jones Act for all disability instances except retirement payments.
<EOS>
This Unum Policy 4702860.pdf specifies that various income sources are not deductible from gross disability payments. These include but are not limited to: 401(k) plans, profit sharing plans, thrift plans (as of 6/1/2005), tax-sheltered annuities, stock ownership plans, non-qualified deferred compensation plans, pension plans for partners, military pensions and disability income, credit disability insurance, franchise disability income plans, retirement plans from other employers, individual retirement accounts (IRA), individual disability income plans, no-fault motor vehicle plans, salary continuation or accumulated sick leave plans. These sources are not to be subtracted from the disability payment in their entirety.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, the minimum monthly payment under the Minimum Benefit is either $100 or 10% of your gross disability payment. Whichever amount is greater will be applied towards any outstanding overpayment. This stipulation can be found on pages [20] rows [1, 3, 4, 6].
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, any deductible income sources subtracted from your gross disability payment will not further decrease the payment due to a cost-of-living increase stemming from that source. This policy applies across rows 1, 2, and 3 on page [20]. In other words, once the necessary adjustments have been made for deductible income, any subsequent cost-of-living increases related to those sources will not affect your disability payment reduction.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, the duration of your monthly payments depends on your age at disability. If you're under 60, your payment period extends up to the age of 65 for a minimum of 5 years. For individuals aged 60, the payment period is 60 months (5 years). At age 61, it reduces to 48 months (4 years), followed by 42 months (3 years and 6 months) at age 62. For those aged 63, the payment period is 36 months (3 years), 30 months (2 years and 6 months) at age 64, 24 months (2 years) at age 65, 21 months at age 66, 18 months at age 67, 15 months at age 68, and finally 12 months for those aged 69 and above.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, payments will cease on the earliest of several events: If a policyholder returns to their regular occupation part-time but chooses not to, or if they earn more than 80% of their indexed monthly earnings while working. The end of the maximum payment period, cessation of disability as defined by the plan, failure to provide proof of continuing disability, and residing outside the US or Canada for 6 months or more during any 12 consecutive months of benefits are other triggers. For policyholders ineligible in another group, payments stop after part-time work capability but choosing not to work, full work ability but choosing not to work part-time, or earning over 80% of indexed earnings while working. In all cases, payments cease upon the policyholder's death.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf on pages 22, rows 1-10, benefits for disabilities primarily based on self-reported symptoms or mental illness are limited to a cumulative maximum of 24 months. This applies regardless if the disabilities are not continuous or unrelated. Payments may continue beyond the 24-month period if you meet either of these conditions: (1) your disability is expected to result in death, or (2) you undergo an organ transplant. The policy emphasizes that benefits will be restricted to a maximum of 24 months for any combination of such disabilities.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, during confinement beyond the initial 24-month period, payments will continue. If you remain disabled upon discharge, a recovery period of up to 90 days follows with continued payments. If reconfined within that recovery period for at least 14 consecutive days, additional payments are sent during the subsequent confinement and an extra recovery period of up to 90 days.
<EOS>
This Unum Policy 4702860.pdf detail states that after receiving payments for a specified 24-month period, continued disability status allows for additional payments during any subsequent hospital or institutional confinement lasting 14 days consecutively. Payments will cease upon the completion of the limited pay period or maximum payment duration, whichever comes first. The mental illness limitation does not apply to dementia resulting from stroke, trauma, viral infection, Alzheimer's disease, or other conditions not typically treated by a mental health provider using psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or similar methods, as outlined in LTD-BEN-9 (6/1/2005) REV 1.

According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, a pre-existing condition is defined as any medical condition for which you have received treatment, consultation, care or services, including diagnostic measures, or taken prescribed drugs or medicines within the three months prior to your coverage's effective date. Importantly, if your disability begins during the first 12 months following your effective date of coverage, it may be considered a pre-existing condition.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, if your disability recurs within six months after the end of a prior claim and you were continuously insured under the plan during that period, Unum will not require another elimination period for the recurrent disability. The recurrent disability is subject to the same terms as the prior claim and considered an extension of it. Any disability occurring more than six months after the end of the prior claim will be treated as a new claim, subject to all policy provisions including a new elimination period. If you become entitled to payments under any other group long-term disability plan, you will not receive benefits from the Unum plan (LTD-OTR-1, 6/1/2005 REV 1).
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, if you die while receiving disability benefits and your disability has lasted for at least 180 days, your eligible survivor or estate will receive a lump sum equivalent to 3 months of your gross disability payment. If there are no survivors or an estate does not exist, no payment is made. However, the policy allows for early payment if you're terminally ill, providing a lump sum equal to 3 months of your gross disability payment upon diagnosis with a terminal illness and life expectancy of less than 12 months. This benefit requires written election from the policyholder and physician certification, is available only once, and may be paid prior to death. If exercised before death, no additional 3-month survivor benefit will be payable upon death.

It is crucial to note that the specific details regarding the maximum benefit and reduction percentages for concurrent payments will depend on the individual plan provisions.

According to Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, 'Monthly Earnings' refers to your gross income earned monthly from your employer, as defined within the plan. This amount is crucial for calculating disability benefits. If unable to work due to a covered disability, your benefit will be determined based on this predefined income amount. The policy does not specify any reduction or adjustment for taxes, retirement contributions, or other deductions typically made from monthly paychecks, meaning the gross income figure remains unaltered.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 4702860.pdf, a monthly payment refers to your disability payment less any deductible sources of income. The policy also defines part-time work as the ability to earn between 20% and 80% of your indexed monthly earnings on a part-time basis. These terms are crucial in understanding the conditions for disability benefits under this policy, with the specific figures of 20% and 80% indicating potential earning levels while maintaining eligibility for partial disability benefits.

The evaluation takes into account the national economy's standard for this occupation.

Self-reported symptoms are manifestations not verifiable by standard medical tests or examinations.
