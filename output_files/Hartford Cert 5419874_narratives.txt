According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, your insurance coverage may vary due to changes in your job class or pre-disability earnings. An increase in coverage is effective only when you are an active employee and not absent from work due to disability. If absent, the increase will take effect upon your return to work for a full day. A reduction in earnings requires notice, with the change becoming effective upon receipt of that notice. Changes to the policy itself may become effective immediately but are subject to the Deferred Effective Date provision and Pre-existing Conditions Limitation.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf (rows 2-10, page 11), if you were previously insured and ineligible for benefits under a prior policy on the day before the Participating Employer Effective Date, the Deferred Effective Date provision will not apply, and your coverage under this new policy is subject to a Pre-existing Condition Limitation. If you become insured under this new policy on the Participating Employer Effective Date and were covered under the prior policy on the day before, the Pre-existing Conditions Limitation will end on the earliest of: 1) the Participating Employer Effective Date if your disability coverage was not limited by a pre-existing condition in the prior policy; or 2) the date the restriction would have ceased to apply had the prior policy remained in force.

The Monthly Benefit payable for a Pre-existing Condition will be the lesser of: 1) the amount paid by the prior policy; or 2) the Monthly Benefit provided by this new policy. The Pre-existing Conditions Limitation applies after the Participating Employer Effective Date to any benefit increase resulting from changing policies, options, classes, or the policy itself.

If you received Monthly benefits for disability under the prior policy and returned to work as a Full-time Active Employee before the Participating Employer Effective Date, and then have a recurrence of the same disability while covered under this new policy within 6 months of your return, and no benefits are available for the recurrence under the prior policy, the Elimination Period will be waived if the recurrence would have been covered without any further elimination period under the prior policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, your coverage will terminate on the earliest of:

  1. The date when the policy terminates.
  2. If the policy no longer insures your class.
  3. When a premium payment is due but not paid.
  4. The last day of the period for which any required premium contribution is made.
  5. The date your employer ends your employment or you cease to be a full-time active employee in an eligible class for any reason.
  6. If your employer stops being a participating employer.

However, the coverage can continue in accordance with any continuation provisions.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf outlines continuation provisions for coverage beyond its termination date, contingent upon the employer providing a uniform plan for all employees. Continued coverage is subject to policy reductions, employer premium payments, and termination if the policy terminates, employer ceases as a participating entity, or class coverage ends. The benefit level remains the same as the day before continuation.

Family Military Leave of Absence allows coverage extension up to 15 days if your spouse or child enters active military service outside specific regions and you meet certain employment and service requirements. Family Medical Leave can extend coverage for up to 8 weeks, or 26 weeks when coupled with Military Leave, per the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 or applicable state/local law. These extensions terminate immediately if leaves end prior to agreed dates.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 12 and rows 2 through 6, if you become disabled and cease being an active employee, your insurance coverage will continue under specific conditions. Firstly, during the Elimination Period, your coverage is maintained as long as your disability remains the same. Secondly, following the Elimination Period, your coverage persists for as long as you are eligible for policy benefits. This continuation of coverage is subject to the terms and conditions outlined within The Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 12, rows 2-6, no premium payments are required after the Elimination Period, and this waiver continues as long as benefits are payable. This means that once you've satisfied the initial waiting period, you will not be charged premiums while receiving benefit payments.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 12, rows 2-8, if you become disabled and your benefits are due, they will continue as long as your disability persists, even if the participating employer's coverage terminates. However, the benefits will not extend beyond the date when the insurance would have ceased paying out had it remained active. The termination of the participating employer's coverage for any reason will not impact our liability under this provision. Essentially, your benefits will be maintained for the same disability until they would naturally end if the insurance was still in effect.
<EOS>
In the event of insurance termination due to employment ending (other than retirement) or ineligibility, and if one has been continuously insured for at least 12 months under The Policy or both The Policy and the Prior Policy, maintains health, and no similar benefits are available from another group policy, a right to enroll in the group long term disability conversion policy exists. To exercise this right, written request, premium payment, and enrollment fee must be submitted within 31 days of insurance termination. The converted coverage begins the day after termination, is issued without Evidence of Insurability, on the then-issued form for conversion purposes, and may differ from The Policy. The group long term disability conversion policy terms are determined based on the available insurance at the time of enrollment request.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 13 rows 2-12, if you become disabled while insured under this policy, and meet the following conditions: 1) remain disabled throughout the elimination period; 2) continue being disabled beyond the elimination period; and 3) submit proof of loss to the company, you will receive a monthly disability benefit. The benefit accrues from the first day after the elimination period and is paid monthly. However, benefits will not surpass the maximum duration of benefits.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf (pages 13, rows [2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]), disability due to mental illness resulting from any cause, conditions stemming from such illnesses, alcoholism under treatment, or non-medical use of narcotics, sedatives, stimulants, hallucinogens, or similar substances will be subject to a limited duration of benefits. These benefits will be payable for the length of confinement in a hospital or licensed medical care facility (for the disabling condition), or if not confined, for up to 24 months after discharge, with a total of 24 months for all such disabilities throughout your lifetime.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, if you recover from a disability but subsequently become disabled again due to the same or a related cause within 180 days of the initial period, the two periods will be considered as one, provided the policy remains active. If your recovery period is less than half the length of your elimination period and you return to work as an active employee, those recovery days won't count towards your elimination period. Any new disability after a 180-day recovery or remission will be treated as a new disability, subject to a fresh elimination period, maximum duration of benefits, and all policy terms in effect at that time.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, under section Recover or Recovery, if you are no longer Disabled, you must resume working with the Employer for premiums to be continued. This provision applies after your disability status changes and you start earning an income again.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 14 and subsequent rows 2-10, your disability benefits are calculated if you remain disabled beyond the elimination period and earn 20% or less of your indexed pre-disability earnings. The monthly benefit is determined by multiplying your pre-disability earnings by the benefit percentage, comparing this sum with the maximum benefit, and deducting any Other Income Benefits from the lesser amount to derive your Monthly Benefit.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on page 14, rows [2-6, 8-12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the policy outlines how disability benefits are calculated if you remain disabled and earn more than 20% of your indexed pre-disability earnings. During a 12-month period following the later event: start date of earning more than 20%, or end of elimination period, we'll determine your monthly benefit as follows: multiply pre-disability earnings by the benefit percentage, compare this with the maximum benefit, then deduct other income benefits to get your monthly benefit. Current monthly earnings are not used for reduction. However, if combined earnings exceed 100% of pre-disability earnings, we'll reduce your monthly benefit by the excess. If you remain disabled and aren't receiving Return to Work Incentive benefits yet, earning over 20% of indexed pre-disability earnings will have us calculate your monthly benefit using either the Proportionate Loss Formula or the 50% Offset Formula.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, page 14 row 5, the policy provides an Indexed Pre-disability Earnings benefit in case of disability. To be eligible for this benefit, you must not earn more than 20% of your pre-disability earnings after becoming disabled. The benefit amount is adjusted periodically based on changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to account for inflation. This benefit continues until you reach age 65 or return to work full time and earn more than 85% of your pre-disability earnings, whichever comes first. Additionally, if you are already receiving Social Security Disability Income (SSDI), the monthly benefit will be reduced by that amount to avoid double payments.
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 14 and 15 (rows 1-5, 1, 1, 2), if the sum of your Monthly Benefit, Current Monthly Earnings, and Other Income Benefits surpasses 100% of your Pre-disability Earnings, your Monthly Benefit will be reduced by the excess amount. However, it will never fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit. If an overpayment occurs, they reserve the right to recover all or any portion of the overpayment in accordance with their Overpayment Recovery provision.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on page 15, row 2, there's a Minimum Monthly Benefit in your insurance policy. This benefit is specified in the Schedule of Insurance and ensures that your monthly payout will not fall below this minimum amount. The exact figure can be found within the schedule of your policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 15, rows 2 and 3, if a Monthly Benefit is payable for less than a month, the payment will be calculated as 1/30 of the monthly benefit for each day you are disabled. This means that if you were disabled for 10 days, you would receive 10/30ths (approximately 33%) of your monthly benefit as compensation. This partial month payment is based on the number of days you were actually disabled during the period.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, your disability benefits will cease on the earliest of these events:

* Your recovery from disability,
* Failure to provide Proof of Loss,
* Discontinuation of Regular Care by a Physician,
* Refusal to submit to an examination by a Physician or other professional,
* Your demise,
* The last day benefits are payable according to the Maximum Duration of Benefits Table,
* Monthly Earnings exceeding 80% of Indexed Pre-disability Earnings if disabled from your occupation, or 60% if from any occupation,
* No further benefits payable under any Policy provision limiting benefit duration.
<EOS>
Under Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, Family Care Credit Benefit allows deducting Family Care expenses while calculating benefits for individuals in a Rehabilitation program. Family Care includes caring for children under 13 or a mentally/physically handicapped dependent. The monthly deduction for each qualifying individual is $350 during the first year and $175 thereafter, with a maximum annual total of $2,500.

The deduction is proportionally reduced for periods less than a month, and charges must be backed by receipts from caregivers. The credit ceases when the policyholder leaves Rehabilitation or after 24 months of Family Care Credits during disability. No family-related care will be eligible as a deduction.

Your current monthly earnings, minus the Family Care Credit, determine your monthly benefit. However, you won't receive a monthly benefit under this policy if your current monthly earnings exceed 80% of your pre-disability earnings.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf provision on pages [15, 16] outlines the Survivor Income Benefit. If you die while receiving a Monthly Disability Benefit, your survivors will receive this benefit. We require proof of your death and entitlement within a year of your demise. The Survivor Income Benefit is three times your Maximum Monthly Benefit and is distributed to your Surviving Spouse first, then to your Surviving Children in equal shares if no spouse exists, and to your estate if there are no survivors. We may apply this benefit to any overpayment on your claim first. The deadline for providing proof is one year after death.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, a Surviving Spouse is defined as your legally non-separated or non-divorced spouse at the time of your death. However, your domestic partner or civil union partner can also be considered a Surviving Spouse under certain conditions:

1) If you and your partner have executed a domestic partner affidavit acceptable to The Policy, establishing you as domestic partners or civil union partners.
2) If registration as domestic partners or civil union partners is available through a government agency or office, and you provide proof of such registration (unless doing so is prohibited by law).

Your status as domestic partners or civil union partners will remain valid if you continue to meet the requirements outlined in the domestic partner affidavit or as required by law.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, the Surviving Children term pertains to unmarried, legally adopted, or step children residing with you in a parental relationship and eligible to be claimed as dependents on your last federal income tax return before your death. Qualifying children must either be under 21 years old or aged between 21-25 and enrolled full-time at an educational institution. If a minor child receives benefits, payments can be made to their caregiver until a legal guardian is appointed.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf section on Workplace Modification Benefit (rows [2-11, 1-7]) outlines reimbursement for reasonable modifications to your workplace to accommodate your disability and facilitate your return to work as an Active Employee. To qualify, your disability must be covered by the policy, your employer must agree to make necessary adjustments, and our approval is required for any proposed changes.

Approved costs will not exceed the amount equal to item number 1 of the Maximum Monthly Benefit. We may evaluate the appropriateness of these modifications through examinations or evaluations by a Physician, health care professional, vocational expert, or rehabilitation specialist (our choice).

Reimbursement will occur after the proposed modifications are complete, we've received written proof of expenses, and you have returned to work as an Active Employee.
<EOS>
According to the Workplace Modification section on Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf (pages 16, rows 2-3), if you are disabled and require changes to your work environment or job duties for continued employment, this policy will cover such accommodations without reducing or denying any other benefits stated in the policy. The policy provides coverage for these modifications to enable you to perform essential job duties while disabled.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 16 and 17, under row numbers 2, 3, and 1, if you are diagnosed with a Progressive Illness after becoming covered for this benefit within the policy, you must provide proof from your physician of the progressive illness to be eligible for the Progressive Illness Benefit.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf policy detail (rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2] on page 17) outlines the Progressive Illness provision. A non-infectious, prolonged disease causing disability as it worsens or symptoms intensify impacting one's occupation falls under this category. If disabled due to a Progressive Illness, your pre-disability earnings will be the greater of either the time proof is provided by your physician or at the time of policy-defined disability. Benefits for such disabilities are calculated using the determined pre-disability earnings and considering all applicable policy terms and conditions effective on the disability date. Premium calculations prior to disability are based on the greater of your pre-disability earnings under this benefit or under the policy terms. Your premium will not drop below the amount paid at proof of Progressive Illness submission, except if you qualify for Waiver of Premium under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, during policy coverage, a monthly benefit is payable for accidental dismemberment or loss of sight, provided the losses occur within 365 days after the accident. The duration and amount of the benefit depend on the specific loss:

- Total Loss of Sight in one eye results in a benefit of 75% of the monthly benefit amount.
- Loss of Sight in both eyes or Loss of use of one hand or foot results in a benefit of 100% of the monthly benefit amount.
- Loss of more than one finger from one hand, total loss of thumb on one hand, or loss of use of more than one toe on one foot results in a benefit equal to 60% of the monthly benefit amount.
- Loss of less than specified body parts leads to a benefit proportionate to their importance and severity.

The benefit is paid after an elimination period following the accident, and the number of months for which the benefit is payable varies depending on the loss.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 17, rows 2-12, this policy outlines various scenarios involving the loss of different body parts. The loss of both hands or both feet, one hand and one foot, one hand and one eye, one foot and one eye, or one hand or one foot results in a benefit payment under coverage 46, equal to 23 times the basic monthly benefit. Additionally, if only one eye is lost, the policyholder may receive partial benefits based on the level of vision loss as defined in the Vision Loss Benefit Schedule. Any permanent total disability due to the loss of both eyes also triggers full policy benefits. The timeframe for determining eligibility for these benefits is not specified in this section.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 17, rows 14 through 5, the policy pertains to the loss of the thumb and index finger of either hand. The monthly benefit amount is the smaller of two options: firstly, the Maximum Monthly Benefit as shown in the Schedule of Insurance; secondly, your Pre-disability Earnings multiplied by the Benefit Percentage. In other words, if the former exceeds the latter, the lower value will be paid out monthly. The policy does not specify any particular duration for this benefit.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, the term 'Loss' pertains to severe injuries that include: full and irreversible loss of hands or feet above the wrist or ankle joints, complete paralysis of any limbs, entire and irrecoverable loss of sight, speech, or hearing, and actual severance of the thumb or index finger through or above their respective metacarpophalangeal joints. These conditions are subject to this policy's coverage.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf details exclusions for disability benefits on pages 17 and 18. The policy does not cover disabilities:

  1) Not under a physician's regular care.
  2) Caused or contributed to by war, act of war (declared or not), commission/attempt of a felony, illegal occupation, or intentionally self-inflicted injury.
  3) For which benefits were previously received from an employer-sponsored disability plan that terminated before this policy's effective date. No benefits will be payable for such disabilities under the current policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 18 rows 2-8, benefits will not be provided or increased for disabilities caused by pre-existing conditions unless the policyholder has not received medical care for the condition for three consecutive months while insured under the policy, or if they have been continuously insured for twelve consecutive months. In other words, if you become disabled due to a pre-existing condition and haven't gone without treatment for at least three months during your coverage period, or if you haven't maintained continuous coverage for a year, your claim may not be covered under the policy terms.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf (page 18, rows 2-11), a pre-existing condition is defined as any accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, pregnancy, or episode of substance abuse, and any associated manifestations, symptoms, findings, or aggravations related to these conditions. Such conditions must have received medical care during the three months leading up to either: the policy's effective date of coverage or the effective date of a coverage change.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 18, rows 2-5, medical care is covered under the following conditions: A physician or healthcare provider may provide treatment either by giving medical advice, being consulted, recommending specific treatments, prescribing medications, or directly providing care. The policy will cover eligible expenses resulting from these services, with no limitations specified on the number of times medical advice is sought or treatment received, provided it is deemed necessary and reasonable for the covered individual's health. Exclusions may apply in cases where treatment is deemed experimental or investigational. Furthermore, certain pre-existing conditions may be subject to a waiting period before coverage becomes effective. In such cases, the waiting period will last for 12 months, after which full benefits will be applicable.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 18 rows 2-5, treatment encompasses medical examinations, tests, attendance, or observation as well as the use of drugs, medicines, medical services, supplies, or equipment. This includes necessary and reasonable costs for these services, subject to policy limits and any applicable deductibles or coinsurance requirements. Additionally, pre-approval may be required for certain treatments, and failure to obtain such approval could result in denial of benefits. Furthermore, this coverage is limited to the policy period and does not extend to experimental or investigational procedures unless specifically approved by The Hartford.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, a notice of claim should be given within 30 days following either the date of loss or death. If timely notice isn't possible, it must be provided as soon as reasonably practical. The notice should include the claimant's name, address, and Participating Employer Account Number. Failure to meet these deadlines may impact your benefits.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, in case of a claim, the company will provide a Proof of Loss form within 15 days of receiving a Notice of Claim. If forms are not provided within this timeframe, the claimant may submit any other written proof detailing the nature and extent of the claim instead. This documentation should be submitted as soon as possible to facilitate prompt processing.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf details the Proof of Loss requirements for disability claims on pages 18 and 19. Essential information includes: dates, causes, and prognoses of disabilities; tax returns, earnings, and current income documentation; medical records, x-rays, and treatment notes; physicians' and hospitals' contact details, along with pharmacy information for prescriptions within three years. Authorization is required to access and share relevant medical, employment, and financial data, as well as any additional info needed. Claimants must also disclose all other income benefits and proof thereof, confirming applications for available benefits. Retirement benefits need not be claimed if only obtainable on a reduced basis. All submitted proof should be satisfactory to the insurer.
<EOS>
Under the Hartford Cert 5419874 policy, you grant us the right to request meetings, interviews, and examinations with our representative or chosen professionals for determining your disability status or fulfilling other policy terms. These assessments will be at our expense and reasonably required by us. The results must satisfy us, and failure to comply may lead to denial, suspension, or termination of benefits unless you have a valid reason for refusal.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 19, rows 2-11, proof of loss for claims must be submitted within 90 days from the start of the period you are insured for payment. However, if it's impossible to meet this deadline or proof is provided as soon as possible but no later than one year after, it will not affect your claim. The insurance company may request proof at any point during your disability, and in such cases, it should be submitted within 30 days of the request, or you will not be able to make a claim if you are not legally competent beyond this period.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, if you are deemed disabled and eligible for benefits (page 19, rows 2-9), payments will be issued at the end of each month during your disability. Optionally, an advance benefit payment may be made based on the estimated duration of your disability. Any payment due following claim termination will be paid upon receipt of satisfactory Proof of Loss (page 19, row 5).
<EOS>
According to the claims section of Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf (pages 19, rows 2-11), all payments from your claim will be made directly to you. In case of your death, any unpaid amounts might be transferred to your estate. If at the time of payment, your estate, a minor, or an incompetent person is due the funds, The Hartford may disburse up to $1,000 to a relative who, at their discretion, is entitled to it. This payment fulfills their obligation for the amount distributed.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf (pages 19, rows 2-12), if your claim for benefits is either fully or partially denied, you will receive a written notification detailing the specific reasons behind the denial and referencing the relevant policy provisions. The notification will also describe any additional information required to complete your claim, explaining why it's necessary, and provide an explanation of the review procedure. This information may help perfect your claim or initiate a potential appeal process.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, you or your representative have the right to appeal any claim denial within specified timeframes. For disability-related claims, this must be done in writing within 180 days of receiving the denial. For non-disability claims, the window is 60 days. You can request copies of relevant documents and submit written comments, additional documents, or information related to your claim during the appeal process. The insurer will provide a final decision on the claim in writing.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on page 20 (rows 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2), if you disagree with a decision regarding your Disability Benefits claim, you have the right to an arbitrator for dispute resolution. To invoke arbitration, contact the American Arbitration Association's main office in Washington, D.C., following their procedures established for Employee Benefit Plan Claims. The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator from their approved panel for employee benefit disputes. Both parties will share equally the cost of arbitration unless directed otherwise by the arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision is final and binding, and it can be turned into a court judgment in any jurisdiction.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 20, rows 2-8, you must apply for Social Security disability benefits when your disability duration meets the minimum requirement. It's essential to submit your application within 45 days from our request for it. In case of a denial, you are required to follow the Social Security Administration's established process to reconsider the decision and, upon another denial, request a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge at the Office of Hearing and Appeals.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf details the method for estimating Disability benefits under the United States Social Security Act. The insurance company reserves the right to reduce your Monthly Benefit by estimating any potential SS disability benefits you or your dependents may receive. To avoid reduction, apply for SS disability benefits, pursue all required appeals, authorize SSA to release information about awards, and sign a reimbursement agreement.

If estimated benefits are later awarded, the company will adjust your Monthly Benefit; if denied, they'll adjust when you provide proof of final denial. If the actual SS Benefits are lower than the estimate, the company will refund in a lump sum. Conversely, if higher and overpayments occurred, you must refund the company equal to all overpayments according to the Overpayment Recovery provision.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 21 and the subsequent rows [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], an overpayment happens when the total benefits paid exceeds what's due under The Policy, or when a payment is made that should have been made under another group policy. Causes include retroactive awards from sources defined in Other Income Benefits, failure to report or late notification of such benefits or earned income, misstatements, fraud, errors, and any other reasons specified by the insurer.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, the insurer has the right to recover overpayments within 30 days if benefits are overpaid on any claim. The policyholder is obligated to refund this amount. This recovery may involve the policyholder directly or other organizations, insurance companies, individuals who received payments, and even their estate.

The insurer can also reduce or offset future benefits due to them or the policyholder's survivors (including the Minimum Monthly Benefit) until full reimbursement is made. If reimbursement is delayed, they may refer the unpaid balance to a collection agency, pursue legal action, and enforce all related rights in court. Payments can continue once the overpayment has been recovered.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 21 rows 2-10, if a Third Party's act or omission causes your Disability, and you receive benefits for lost wages under the policy, but fail to pursue legal action against the Third Party within a reasonable timeframe, the insurance company will be subrogated to any rights you have against that Third Party. They may then opt to recover any payments made for the Disability by taking legal action against the Third Party.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, the company reserves the right to seek reimbursement for any disability benefit payments made or required, where a third party makes a payment in the form of a legal judgment, arbitration award, settlement, or otherwise. If such recovery occurs, you are obligated to repay the company, with the lesser amount being either the paid or required benefit amount by us or the recovered sum from the third party minus any reasonable legal fees associated with the recovery process. This repayment applies to the rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] on page number [21].
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, third-party refers to any individual or legal entity whose action or inaction partially or fully causes you to experience a Disability. Benefits payable under the policy are contingent upon this third party's role in causing your disability.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, legal action against us can only be initiated: after a lapse of 60 days from the date Proof of Loss is submitted, or beyond three years following the date when Proof of Loss ought to have been provided according to the terms of The Policy.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf (page 22, rows 1-5), insurance fraud occurs when you or your employer supply false information or file a claim with incomplete or misleading details, intending to deceive or defraud the company. This is considered a crime, and the company will utilize all available resources to detect, investigate, deter, and prosecute such offenders. If found guilty of insurance fraud, legal remedies will be pursued.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 22, rows 2-3, 4-5, 6, 1, 2, and 3, any material misstatements about the policyholder may lead to premium adjustments and evaluation of coverage duration. After three years, statements regarding the policyholder's insurability will not be used to contest the insurance unless they are fraudulent, written, and signed. If used, these statements must remain in force for at least three years during the policyholder's lifetime.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, an employee is considered "Actively at Work" when they are employed with the employer on a scheduled workday. This entails performing regular duties of their occupation in the usual manner for their typical number of hours. Importantly, if a day is not a scheduled workday, Actively at Work status can only be granted if the employee was Actively at Work on the preceding scheduled workday.
<EOS>

According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages [22, 23], Disability or Being Disabled means you are unable to perform one or more essential duties of your occupation during the elimination period. During the initial 24 months following the elimination period, if your current monthly earnings are less than 80% of your indexed pre-disability earnings, it applies. After that, disability is determined by inability to perform any occupation.

If your earnings at the end of the elimination period are 80% or more of your pre-disability earnings, the elimination period will be extended for an additional 12 months or until your current monthly earnings drop below 80%. Your disability must stem from accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse, or pregnancy.

Government employers, excepting the federal government, must provide health benefits to civil union dependents, provided they offer it to married dependents.

This amount is $XXX,XXX (replace XXX,XXX with the actual stated sum). The policy does not require any additional premium payments beyond the initial payment or any scheduled premium increases.

On the Participating Employer Effective Date, if not actively at work, and otherwise meeting the eligibility requirements of The Policy, your insurance amount will be the lesser of what you had under the Prior Policy or shown in the Schedule of Insurance, minus any coverage amounts in force or payable under the Prior Policy. Your coverage ends within 12 consecutive months after the Participating Employer Effective Date, termination for any reason stated under The Policy, the last day you would have been covered under the Prior Policy (had it not terminated), or the date you start actively working again.

5. You being inactive at work.
6. Your employer ceasing to be a Participating Employer, unless continued under any continuation provisions.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages [43, 44] outlines continuation provisions for insurance coverage. Coverage can be extended beyond its termination date if the employer provides a uniform plan for all employees. Continued coverage is subject to reductions in the policy, premium payments, and ends when the policy does or the employer ceases to participate. Coverage periods vary based on leave of absence, military service, family military leave, lay-off, status change, disability insurance, sickness/injury, or family medical leave.

For instance, coverage may continue for up to a month following a documented leave of absence, up to 8 weeks during active military service, 15 days for family military leaves (after meeting certain conditions), until the third consecutive month after a reduction in scheduled hours, or 12 months due to disability insurance. Continuation periods may also extend up to 12 months for sickness/injury-related leaves, up to 8 weeks for family medical leaves, and up to 26 weeks if eligible for both family military leave and family medical leave.

Continued coverage terminates immediately if the agreement ends prematurely or if the employee's work status changes significantly. For Family Military Leave of Absence, the employee must give notice at least 14 days before the leave begins if it consists of more than five consecutive workdays.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 44, rows 2-7, the Waiver of Premium provision allows for continued Life Insurance coverage during disability without paying premiums. The continued coverage amount is based on the policy's state on the date you cease being an Active Employee, subject to any reductions in the policy and without subsequent increase. Eligibility for this waiver requires qualifying as disabled under its defined terms.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, only Your Basic Life Insurance is covered under this provision (row 2, page 44). The coverage is exclusive to this policy type and does not extend to other insurance provisions. Please refer to the document for further details regarding terms, conditions, and limitations associated with this coverage.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 44, rows 2-10, 'Disabled' refers to a state where an individual is unable to perform any work due to injury or illness that they are qualified for based on education, training, or experience. Additionally, a diagnosis of a life expectancy of 12 months or less qualifies as Disabled.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, to qualify for the Waiver of Premium provision, you must meet specific conditions: firstly, you should be enrolled in the policy and under the age of 60 when disabled; secondly, prove your disability after being continuously disabled for six months from the last day actively working; this proof must be provided within one year of your final day as an active employee. Note that to qualify for Waiver of Premium, you must have been actively employed under the policy.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf details the terms for premium waiver. Premiums will not be waived for the first six months of disability. The insurer may require proof of disability and can conduct examinations during the initial two years, though not more than once a year after that. Failure to provide proof or refuse examination terminates the waiver. If the application is denied, conversion coverage is an option. Returning to work for five days or less within the first six months won't interrupt the waiting period, but any subsequent work requires a new waiting period. The disability must persist for the entire six-month period unless working more than five days starts a new period.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, if you die within a year of your last day as an Active Employee and before qualifying for Waiver of Premium, the policy will pay the in-force Life Insurance amount, under three conditions:

1) You were continuously disabled during this period.
2) This disability lasted, or would have lasted, six months or more.
3) Premiums for coverage had been consistently paid before your death.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 45, rows 2-9, the Waiver of Premium provision allows for coverage continuation during disability. This benefit ceases upon attaining Normal Retirement Age if disabled before age 60. If you return to work in an Eligible Class as an Active Employee, you may again be eligible for coverage, given timely premium payments. Alternatively, if you do not resume work in an Eligible Class, coverage ends, and you might be eligible to convert the policy under the Conversion Right, subject to its terms and conditions, within specified time limits. The amount of Life Insurance that can be converted is subject to the Conversion Right's stipulations.
<EOS>
In the event of policy termination or your employer no longer being a Participating Employer under Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, you may have the option to convert the policy (subject to specified time limits). Additionally, if you've already qualified for Waiver of Premium beforehand, this benefit will not be affected even in such cases. Noteworthy, you might still qualify for Waiver of Premium after your employer ceases participation, assuming you meet the necessary criteria.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 45 rows 2, 3, and 1, the Life Insurance Benefit is payable upon your death if you are covered under The Policy. Payment will be made after receiving Proof of Loss in accordance with the Provisions for Proof of Loss. The benefit will adhere to the General Provisions of The Policy.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf section on pages [45, 46], rows [2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2] outlines the Accelerated Benefit. If you're covered for at least $10,000 under age 60, and diagnosed as Terminally Ill, we will pay an Accelerated Benefit amount up to 80% of your coverage, but not less than $3,000 or more than $500,000. Requests can be made only once. A person proving Terminal Illness also meets the Waiver of Premium definition for Disability. If required by law to accelerate benefits or to qualify for a government benefit, you must still satisfy all terms and conditions. If an Assignment of rights and interest exists, we must receive a release from the assignee before benefits are payable.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, pages 46 rows 2, 3, 1, and 2, the policyholder must submit proof of Terminal Illness by a Physician upon request. Failure to do so or refusal to be examined when required may result in denial of an Accelerated Benefit payment.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf (p.46, rows 2-11), if you are no longer considered Terminally Ill, your coverage may continue as follows:

1. If you return to an Eligible Class and pay your premium, your policy remains in effect.
2. If you do not revert to an Eligible Class but remain disabled (subject to the Waiver of Premium provision), your coverage persists.
3. If neither applies, meaning you're no longer in an Eligible Class and are not disabled, your coverage terminates. However, under certain circumstances, you may exercise the Conversion Right within prescribed time limits. In all cases, any Accelerated Benefit paid will reduce the amount of coverage.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, if Life Insurance coverage under the policy ends for any reason, you may have the right to convert terminated coverage to an individual conversion policy without providing Evidence of Insurability, excluding Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefits or ineligible/uncovered amounts. Conversion is available if insured for 5 years or more when policy, coverage for an Eligible Class, or Participating Employer terminates. The convertible amount is limited to the lesser of $10,000 or the Life Insurance Benefit under the policy minus any group life insurance policy eligibility within 31 days of termination. Coverage can be fully converted if it ends for reasons other than those specified.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, the insurer under this conversion right can be either us or another insurance company that has agreed to issue policies according to this provision. The conversion option allows policyholders to convert their policy into a new one without evidence of insurability, provided the conversion is exercised during the conversion period, typically within a specified timeframe after the termination, expiration, or material reduction in coverage under the original policy. This new policy will provide coverage for the same life as the original policy and may require payment of premiums at our then-current rates. The death benefit amount under the new policy is equal to the lesser of the death benefit amount under the original policy or the amount necessary to fund a single premium whole life insurance policy on the insured's life. This provision applies only to eligible policies, and any questions regarding eligibility should be directed to us.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, in the event of Life Insurance termination, you have a conversion right. To exercise this, complete a Notice of Conversion Right form and get your Employer's signature within 31 days after termination or 15 days from their signature, whichever is later, but not more than 91 days post-termination. After eligibility verification, you will receive a Conversion Policy proposal. Complete the request form, pay the premium as specified, and return them within the proposed timeframe to secure the new policy effective on the 32nd day after coverage ends, replacing previous coverage for this amount under The Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, the Conversion Policy offers Life Insurance coverage with premiums based on current rates for your age class at conversion time. The policy does not provide the same coverage terms as the original policy, offers only a Life Insurance Benefit, and excludes term insurance. However, conversion is unavailable for any amount of Life Insurance being continued under the Waiver of Premium provision or Continuation Provisions until such coverage ends.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 47 row numbers [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1, 2], if the insurance coverage terminates and you die within 31 days of that termination date, we will pay the amount of life insurance you would have been eligible to apply for under this conversion provision. However, if the conversion policy has already taken effect, no life insurance benefit will be payable under this policy for the amount converted. The payment is contingent upon receiving Proof of Loss.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, pages 47 and 48, the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit is payable if an injury within 365 days of an accident results in specified losses, with the Principal Sum (as shown in the Schedule of Insurance) being paid upon proof of loss.

Partial losses receive corresponding percentages of the Principal Sum.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, the Seat Belt and Air Bag Benefit is payable when an injury results in a loss under the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit, if sustained while wearing a seatbelt as verified on the police accident report, either as a passenger or operator of a properly registered motor vehicle. The benefit will be paid after receiving Proof of Loss and according to The Policy's General Provisions.

If an airbag inflated during the incident, an additional Air Bag Benefit is payable if you were correctly strapped in and positioned in a seat equipped with a factory-installed airbag. Both benefits are the lesser of multiples of your Principal Sum by their respective percentages or the Maximum Amount for each benefit. A Minimum Benefit will be payable under the Seat Belt Benefit if it cannot be confirmed that you were wearing a seatbelt at the time of the accident.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, an accident for the purpose of this benefit is defined as an unintentional collision of a Motor Vehicle during which You were not wearing a Seat Belt.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, the Repatriation Benefit is payable if death occurs outside your permanent residence due to an accident resulting in loss of life covered under Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit. This benefit is disbursed upon receiving Proof of Loss and adhering to The Policy's General Provisions.

The Repatriation Benefit amount is the least of: actual expenses for body preparation, cremation, and transportation to burial/cremation site; product of your Principal Sum multiplied by the Repatriation Benefit Percentage; or the Maximum Amount for this Benefit. These specific amounts are detailed in the Schedule of Insurance.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 49 rows [2-18], the policy does not cover any loss that is intentionally self-inflicted, resulting from suicide or attempted suicide, stemming from war or an act of war (declared or not), sustained while on active military duty, arising from drug use (sedatives, narcotics, barbiturates, amphetamines, hallucinogens) unless prescribed by a Physician, incurred during the commission or attempted commission of a felony, or resulting from intoxication.

Proof of loss should always be directed to the company.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, while a claim is pending, the insurer retains the right, at their expense, to have the claimant examined by a Physician as often as they reasonably require (row 2), and in case of death, perform an autopsy if it's not forbidden by law (rows 3-6). These evaluations serve to support or contest any insurance claims.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, once benefits are deemed payable, payments will be issued within 30 days following the submission of a Proof of Loss. The payment process adheres to the Claims to be Paid provision, ensuring timely compensation.

Payments release the company from further liability for that amount. The company may also pay $200 at death and subsequent monthly installments of up to $200 to any qualifying person. These payments will release the company from all further liability for that payment.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 51 rows 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, you can designate or modify your beneficiary by submitting a written request on an acceptable form to the Employer. Only forms received by the Employer prior to your death will be accepted, and the new designation will take effect from the date you signed and dated the form.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, if a benefits claim is either wholly or partially denied, the policyholder or beneficiary will receive written notification detailing the reasons for denial and referencing the specific provisions on which it's based.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 51 and 52, row numbers [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], you have the right to assign your rights and interests under this policy, including making required contributions, converting, and naming or changing a beneficiary.

<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf on pages 52 rows 2-6, misstatements of material facts about the policyholder may necessitate adjustments to the premium and could potentially alter or influence the coverage amount.

<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf (page 59, rows 25-34, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 1), your 'Spouse' refers to your legally non-separated or un-divorced partner, which can also include your domestic partner or civil union partner if you meet certain conditions. To establish this relationship for the policy:

  1. Execute a domestic partner affidavit acceptable by The Company, proving your partnership or civil union status under the policy; OR
  2. Register as domestic partners or civil union partners with a government agency where registration is available, and provide proof unless law prohibits it.

You remain domestic partners or civil union partners as long as you comply with these requirements. For Wisconsin residents, specific adjustments are made:

- In the Claims to be Paid provision, the second and last paragraph amounts change to $1,000 (if not already at this value). However, in all other aspects, the policy and certificates remain unchanged. The document is signed for Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, a dependent is defined as your spouse and any dependent child(ren). A dependent must be a citizen or resident of the United States, its territories, and protectorates. Full-time military service disqualifies an individual from being a dependent, unless they are subsequently called to military service, in which case the required premium must be paid. The age limit for Continuation for Dependent Children with Disabilities is increased to 21 if under 21 years old. An additional provision has been added to the Period of Coverage: dependents with disabilities can remain covered until age 26, or longer if continuously enrolled in a full-time post-secondary educational institution.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf section highlights reinstatement after military service. If you enter active military service and are rehired within 12 months of coverage termination or return from active duty, your coverage can be restored for you and any previously covered spouse/dependents, provided you request this within 31 days of returning to work. The reinstated coverage will be the same as before, without waiting periods, evidence of insurability, or pre-existing condition limitations, subject only to the terms of the policy.

The claims to be paid provision is amended to allow for a $500 payment towards funeral or illness expenses. If any person receives such payment, it releases the company from further liability for that amount. The Seatbelt and Air Bag benefit exclusion is revised, with benefits not payable if the injured person is operating the vehicle while intoxicated or under the influence of narcotics, unless administered by a physician's advice.

The Accidental Death and Dismemberment Exclusions drug exclusion is replaced, with injury sustained while under the influence of narcotics not covered, unless administered on a physician's advice. For Massachusetts residents, the definition of Terminal Illness or Terminally Ill cannot exceed 24 months. For Michigan residents, the Policy Interpretation provision is deleted entirely. For Minnesota residents, the term "granted military leave of absence" in the Military Leave of Absence portion of the Continuation section is included.
<EOS>
In Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, under provisions section on page 55 rows 4 and 5, the 'Lay Off' provision from Continuation Provisions has been replaced with one for 'Documented Military Leave of Absence.' The new provision states that a covered employee who goes on documented military leave will not be considered terminated or laid off during their absence. Instead, coverage can continue up to 24 months if they pay the full premium. Upon returning from military service, they must provide documentation within 30 days for continued coverage. Additionally, there is a provision allowing for a reduction in group size upon return due to changes in employment status or job functions during their absence.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf detail outlines the Lay Off coverage. If you are terminated or laid off, you can opt to continue your coverage by paying premiums to the employer. You must elect this within 60 days from either the coverage termination date or when you receive written notice of the right to continue coverage. The maximum premium charged should not surpass 102% of the previously paid premium for active employee life insurance coverage.

The employer will notify you of your continuation option, monthly premium amount, and payment method & deadline. Upon request, they will also provide a written verification of the coverage cost. Coverage continues until another group policy is obtained or 18 months after termination/layoff; at this point, conversion rights apply (if not exercised earlier). Alternatively, you may accept reduced benefits at a lower premium rate.

Minnesota law stipulates that if your coverage ends due to the employer's failure to notify or pay premiums, they will be liable for benefit payments up to our liability had you remained covered. Layoff refers to reduced working hours making you ineligible for coverage, while termination excludes dismissal for gross misconduct but includes retirement.

The 7th paragraph of the Accelerated Benefit provision is deleted, along with the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th paragraphs of the Conversion Right provision. The 5th paragraph of the Claims to be Paid provision's first sentence is amended: if benefits exceed $15,000, you or your beneficiary can request payment into a draft book account (checking account) owned by either you (if living) or your beneficiary upon death. For Missouri residents, specific time periods in the Conditions for Qualification and Benefit Payable before Approval of documents may differ from standard guidelines.
<EOS>
In the specified section of Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf, under the When Premiums are Waived provision, a retroactive waiver is instituted upon approval. The waiver becomes effective starting from the onset of disability, but only after completing the 180-day waiting period. Regarding the Suicide provision, it has been replaced with new language in the document.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5419874.pdf specifies that if death is due to suicide within a year of the policy effective date, no Supplemental Amount of Life or Dependent Life Insurance will be paid for coverage elected within that period. Premiums paid for the coverage during this time are refunded. If death occurs due to suicide within one year after the initial coverage or elected increase in coverage, it does not apply if the increase resulted solely from an increase in Earnings.

For Montana residents, the conversion right period is increased to 3 years if greater than 3 years, and the amount is set at $10,000 if less. Certain provisions are replaced or deleted, such as Item 2 of Accidental Death and Dismemberment Exclusions being replaced with suicide or attempted suicide, whether sane or insane, and the 2nd paragraph of the Claims to be Paid provision being deleted when not $500. A new provision is added stating that all claims must be paid within $500 if not specified otherwise.
