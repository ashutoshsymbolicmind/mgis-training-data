<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 9, rows 1 and 2, benefits duration is limited to either 11 weeks if the disability arises from an injury or 11 weeks if it results from sickness.

Coverage will only commence once you return to active employment.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, you can decrease or increase your coverage options. An increase requires approval and is subject to a deferred effective date and pre-existing conditions limitations.

According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 37 rows 2, 1, 2, 1, and 2, if you become disabled while no longer being an active employee, your insurance coverage will continue. Firstly, during the Elimination Period, as long as you remain disabled by the same disability. Secondly, after this period ends, your coverage will persist for as long as you are entitled to benefits under The Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, if you become disabled and the Participating Employer's coverage terminates, your benefits will continue as long as your disability persists, but they will not extend beyond the date when payments would have ceased if the insurance had remained active. The termination of the Participating Employer's coverage for any reason will not affect our liability under this provision. In essence, benefits will be provided only up to the date when they would have stopped, had the insurance not terminated.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 38 (rows 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2), if you become disabled while insured under this policy, we will pay you a monthly disability benefit subject to certain conditions. You must be disabled throughout the elimination period and remain disabled beyond it, submit proof of loss, and ensure benefits do not exceed the maximum duration. Benefits accrue from the first day after the elimination period and are paid on a monthly basis.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 11 and following rows 2-3, if your Weekly Benefit is payable for less than a full week, the payment will be calculated as one-fifth of the weekly benefit per day you are disabled. Essentially, if you're unable to work for four days in a week, you'll receive 4/5 of your weekly benefit for that period. This policy applies when calculating benefits spanning fewer than seven consecutive days.
<EOS>
Under the Disabled and Working Benefits of Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, if you're deemed disabled while covered yet working, your weekly total disability benefit will be reduced by half of your current weekly earnings. Approved rehabilitative employment programs may alter this determination. Days spent both disabled and working can fulfill the Benefits Commence Period requirements.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 11 and 12, if a disability follows your return to work as an Active Employee within 15 consecutive calendar days due to the same or a related cause, it will be considered an extension of the initial disability period, provided the policy remains active. Conversely, if you work for 15 consecutive days or more and subsequently become disabled again, this new disability will be treated as separate from the previous one.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, if your Disability period is extended due to a new cause while receiving Weekly Benefits, these benefits will persist as long as you remain Disabled. However, they will not exceed the original Maximum Duration of Benefits. Additionally, any Exclusions pertaining to the new cause of Disability will be applicable.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, benefit payments will cease on the earliest of: your recovery from disability, failure to provide Proof of Loss, discontinuation of regular physician care, refusal to undergo a requested examination, your death, the last day benefits are payable according to the Maximum Duration of Benefits Table, or when your current monthly earnings surpass 80% of your indexed pre-disability earnings if disabled from your occupation.

<EOS>
Under the Rehabilitative Employment Benefit of Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, if you're Totally Disabled or Disabled and Working, accepting rehab employment will not halt your weekly benefit payments. The weekly benefit paid will decrease by half of any earnings from this rehab work, but the total should not surpass 100% of your pre-disability earnings. If the sum exceeds pre-disability earnings, the weekly benefit reduction equals the excess amount. During benefits payment under the policy, we reserve the right to review any rehabilitative employment you participate in. Should you continue being Totally Disabled or Disabled and Working after a rehab period, you may carry on receiving benefits under Total Disability Benefit or Disabled and Working Benefit, subject to the respective maximum payment periods.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (page 42), the policy does not cover disabilities for which no benefit will be paid if:
1) The disabled individual is not under the regular care of a physician.
2) The disability is caused or contributed by war, act of war (declared or undeclared).
3) The disability results from commissioning or attempting to commit a felony.
4) The disability is caused or contributed by being engaged in an illegal occupation.
5) The disability is intentionally self-inflicted.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 74 and 75, the holder of benefits or claimant must provide written notice for any claim within 30 days following either the date of death or loss occurrence. If immediate notice isn't feasible, it should be given as soon as reasonably practical. Essential details included in the notification are the claimant's name, address, and Participating Employer Account Number.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, within 15 days of receiving a Notice of Claim, we will send Proof of Loss forms to the claimant. If we fail to send these forms in time, the claimant may submit any written documentation that fully outlines the nature and extent of the claim as an alternative proof. The claimant has up to 15 days for us to receive a Notice of Claim before initiating this process.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on page [75], Proof of Loss for a claim may include a completed form, death certificate (if applicable), beneficiary designation, details about the date and cause of your disability, prognosis, medical information like x-ray films and copies of records, names and addresses of consulted physicians, hospitals, and pharmacies within the past three years, authorization for releasing medical, employment, and financial information (if applicable), and any additional information necessary for claim adjudication. The proof provided must be satisfactory to The Hartford.

According to the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on page 43 rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3], the policy entitles the company to request the insured for interviews with their representative and examinations by chosen physicians, vocational experts, functional experts, or other professionals. These assessments will be at the company's expense and as reasonably required. The insured's Additional Proof of Loss must meet the company's satisfaction. Refusal to comply without a valid reason may lead to denial, suspension, or termination of benefits.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (pages 43, 44), you must submit Written Proof of Loss within 90 days after the start of the liable period. Failing to do so initially will not impact your claim if: 1) it was impossible to provide proof within the stipulated time, and proof is given as soon as possible, but 2) not later than 1 year after it's due, unless you are not legally competent. Additionally, The Hartford may request Proof of Loss throughout your Disability, requiring submission within 30 days of any such request.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, when we determine that benefits are payable, the payment will be issued within 30 days after receiving Proof of Loss. These payments adhere to the Claims to be Paid provision.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (pages 75-76) details the payout of benefits for claims. Life insurance and accidental death benefits will be paid to a designated beneficiary or, if none survives the policyholder, to their executor/administrator, spouse, children, parents, or burial expense claimant (up to $500). If a minor beneficiary exists, payments can be made to their financial supporter until a legal guardian is appointed.

Otherwise, payments for claims other than loss of life will be made directly to the policyholder during their lifetime or their estate upon death. Payments to minors, incompetent individuals, or estates may amount up to $1,000, payable to a related person entitled to it by the insurer's discretion.

In the event of a life insurance payout, the account owner (either the policyholder or beneficiary) can elect a lump sum payment. Payments will release the insurer from further liability for the amount paid. If a draft book account (checking account) is established, it will be owned by the policyholder or their beneficiary and can be used to make a lump sum withdrawal.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (page 44, rows 2-3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2), if a claim for benefits is either fully or partially denied, you will receive written notification detailing the reasons behind the denial. This notification will cite relevant policy provisions and describe any necessary additional information to validate your claim, while explaining why such information is required. Moreover, it will elucidate the review procedure.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (page 44, rows 2-12), if your claim is denied, you or your representative have the right to request a full and fair review within specific timeframes: 180 days for claims requiring disability determination, or 60 days for non-disability determinations. This appeal entitles you to access all relevant documents, records, and information related to your claim. Additionally, you may submit further comments, documents, records, and information concerning your claim. The Hartford will respond in writing with their final decision on the claim.
<EOS>
According to the Disability Benefits section of Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (page 44, rows [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2]), if a disagreement arises over a Disability Benefits decision, you have the right to initiate arbitration proceedings. To do so, you must contact the American Arbitration Association's main office in Washington, D.C., requesting an arbitration proceeding for Employee Benefit Plan Claims. The arbitration will be conducted by a single, impartial arbitrator selected from the AAA's approved panel for employee benefit disputes. Both parties will equally bear the cost of arbitration unless otherwise directed by the arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding, and it can be converted into a court judgment in any jurisdiction.
<EOS>
According to the Social Security section on Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (page 45, rows 1-2, 3), you must apply for disability benefits when your health condition lasts long enough to qualify for benefits. Apply within 45 days of receiving our request for this application. If the Social Security Administration denies your benefits eligibility, you'll need to follow their process for reconsideration and, if denied again, request a hearing with an Administrative Law Judge from the Office of Hearing and Appeals.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, the insurer may adjust your monthly disability benefits based on potential Social Security disability benefits for you or your dependents. This adjustment can be made if it's determined that you or your dependents are eligible and an estimate of these benefits is made. The reduction will not occur if you apply for disability benefits, pursue all necessary appeals, authorize the Social Security Administration to share information, and sign a reimbursement agreement.

If the actual Social Security disability benefits awarded exceed the estimated amount, your monthly benefit will be adjusted accordingly and an overpayment may require a lump sum refund. Conversely, if the actual Social Security disability benefits are less than the estimate, any difference in favor of you will be refunded in a lump sum.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, an overpayment occurs when the total benefits paid exceed what is due (page 45, rows 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2). This can happen due to overpayments resulting from retroactive awards from specified sources, failure or delay in reporting Other Income Benefits or earned income, misstatements, fraud, or any errors made by the insurer. The overpayment may also arise when a payment is made that should have been made under another group policy. Critical instances include overpayments due to misreported or unreported Other Income Benefits and earnings.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (pages 45-46, rows [2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2]) outlines the insurer's right to recover overpayments. If overpayments occur on any claim, you must reimburse within 30 days. Failure to do so allows the company to recover overpayments from you, other organizations, insurance companies, those to whom payment was made, or your estate. Additionally, they can reduce or offset future benefits payable to you or your survivors until full reimbursement is made, refer your balance to a collection agency, pursue legal action in court, and continue payments once the overpayment has been recovered.
<EOS>
In the event specified by Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (page 46), if you incur a Disability due to a Third Party's act or omission, receive benefits under this policy for lost wages, and do not initiate legal action against that Third Party within a reasonable timeframe, the company reserves subrogation rights to any claims you have against them. The company may opt to bring legal action on your behalf to recover payments made in relation to the Disability.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (pages 46, rows [2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2]), the company reserves the right to request reimbursement for any disability benefits paid if you recover compensation from a third party via legal judgment, arbitration award, settlement, or other means. You must repay the lesser of the amount they paid or the third-party recovery minus any reasonable legal fees associated with the process. This applies whether the third-party payment is partial or full coverage for your disability benefits under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on page 16, row 2, a 'Third Party' refers to any individual or legal entity whose action or inaction contributes, fully or partially, to the cause of an insured event resulting in disability benefits payable under The Policy.
<EOS>

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 77 rows 2-6, insurance fraud is considered a crime when false or misleading information is provided with the intention to deceive the company in any claim for benefits.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 77 (rows 2, 1, 2, 1, 2), any material fact misstatements about the policyholder may result in a premium adjustment and the application of accurate facts to determine if coverage should be provided or increased.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, an Active Employee is one who regularly works for the employer in the scope of its business, at least the number of hours specified in the insurance schedule.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 17, rows 1-3, 1-2, 1, 2, and 1, 2, commissions refer to the weekly average amount you received from your employer during the one-year period preceding your disability onset if you were actively employed before becoming disabled. If this period is less than one year, it refers to the total duration of employment with that employer. Additionally, commissions also encompass any earnings from employers or work performed during your disability period.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, under Current Weekly Earnings, any income you receive from your employer or other employment, including self-employment and freelance work during disability while eligible for Disabled and Working Benefits is considered.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 17, the 'Disabled and Working' definition applies if you are hindered by injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse, or pregnancy from fully performing certain essential duties of your occupation, yet you are working part-time or on limited duty. Your current weekly earnings must be more than 20% but less than or equal to 80% of your pre-disability earnings. This definition applies only if these conditions are met.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, an Essential Duty is a substantially important, fundamental, or inherent task in one's occupation that cannot be reasonably omitted or altered. Specifically, the ability to work the scheduled hours for your job constitutes an Essential Duty.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, bodily injury resulting directly from an accident and independently of all other causes while covered under the policy is considered as Injury. Conversely, losses stemming from sickness or disease, including a pus-forming infection via an accidental wound, or medical/surgical treatment of such conditions are not categorized as Injuries.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, pages 47 and 48, a Mental Illness is defined as a mental disorder listed in the current version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.

However, these benefits exclude early retirement benefits under the United States Social Security Act that are not received, group credit or mortgage disability insurance benefits, personal investment income, and certain other specific exemptions.

If paid in a lump sum or settlement, proof of the amount attributed to loss of income and the covered period is required. Failing to provide this information may result in the entire sum being assumed for loss of income over 60 months. Retroactive allocations of Other Income Benefits are possible but could lead to an overpayment.

Critical exceptions to the inclusion of increases in Other Income Benefits are when such increases take effect after the benefits become payable under the policy or if they are general increases applying to all entitled persons. Lump sum or settlement increases not meeting these criteria will not be considered as Other Income Benefits.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, a Participating Employer is an employer who agrees to contribute towards the Trust in accordance with the policy's provisions and employs Active Employees.

For these individuals, the monthly average earnings are based on their ordinary business income (loss) plus any guaranteed payments, minus Section 179 deductions for the full tax year(s) before disability onset or if employed for less than a year, the total calendar months worked. These earnings also include W-2 wages for the same period and contributions made to 401(k), 403(b) or 457 deferred compensation arrangements, executive non-qualified deferred compensation arrangements, or IRC Section 125 plan salary reduction arrangements.

Pre-disability Earnings do not include dividends, capital gains, and returns of capital. Exceptions apply for those employed as a partner, shareholder, or sole proprietor under federal income tax laws.

This includes any contributions made through salary reduction agreements, such as 401(k), 403(b), 457 deferred compensation arrangements, executive non-qualified deferred compensation arrangements, or a Section 125 plan, for the same period. These earnings are determined using their W-2 forms.

According to the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, Regular Care of a Physician entails seeking treatment from a medical professional with appropriate training and experience to manage your disabling condition.

According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, Total Disability or Totally Disabled status is achieved when an injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse, or pregnancy prevents you from performing the essential duties of your occupation, resulting in earnings less than 20% of your pre-disability earnings. If you hold a job requiring a license, failing a physical examination to maintain that license does not automatically imply disability from your occupation. This definition applies on rows [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] of page number 20 in the document.

For Maine residents, additional provisions apply. You must request reinstatement within 31 days of returning to work.
<EOS>
Under the terms of The Hartford's policy, coverage can be reinstated following termination due to non-payment of premiums.

This Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf section on page [24], rows [3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1] details key policy changes. Recurrent Disability is now considered the same within a 30-day period if less than 30 days. The Policy Interpretation provision has been replaced by ERISA designating the Company as claim fiduciary with discretionary authority over eligibility and interpretation of the policy, while preserving participant/beneficiary's right to judicial review after exhausting administrative remedies. Time periods for Claim Appeal have been extended to 180 days if less than 180 days, and Arbitration provision has been deleted. For New Jersey residents, the Change in Family Status provision has been altered. If the document doesn't specify otherwise, these terms apply.
<EOS>
This insurance policy specifies that the Pre-existing Conditions Limitation will terminate either on the initial coverage date if there was no pre-existing condition restriction under the previous policy, or on the date when such a restriction would have expired had the prior policy continued. Additionally, the Notice of Claim period is modified to 20 days if not already so. A new requirement for autopsies, should they occur during the contestability period, is that they take place in South Carolina. For residents of South Dakota, the definition of a Physician has been revised as stated in the document.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 57 rows 2, 3, 4, 1, and 2, "Physician" is defined as a legally qualified doctor or surgeon, excluding those related by blood or marriage or those who are partners of an S-Corp Shareholder in the same business.

This information from Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf specifies changes for Texas, Utah, and Vermont residents concerning the exercise of Conversion Right, Sending Proof of Loss, and Policy Interpretation provisions. For Texas, the entire Policy Interpretation is deleted. For Utah, the continuous insured period to exercise the Conversion Right extends to 6 months if not already met, while the timeframe for Sending Proof of Loss changes to 90 days where not already present. The Policy Interpretation provision in Utah is removed and replaced with a clause stating benefits are paid at the discretion of the plan administrator, who also determines eligibility and interprets terms of the plan. A claimant may seek judicial review in federal court regarding these determinations, but this does not restrict such review. The federal court will determine the level of discretion to be accorded to the plan administrator's determinations. For Vermont residents, there are no specific modifications to the Policy Interpretation provision, but it maintains its technical terms and requirements.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, Vermont law necessitates that health insurers provide coverage equivalent to that given to married persons to parties in a civil union. This requirement is stated on page 58, row 2 of the document. The law ensures parity in healthcare benefits between civil unions and marriages without specifying particular dates or percentages.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (page 58), definitions for terms like "marriage", "spouse", and "family" in this policy are expanded to include civil unions as established by Vermont law. This includes terms related to marital status, family relationships, dependents, and beneficiaries. The document also defines a "dependent" as a spouse, partner in a civil union, or child who is born to or brought into the marriage/civil union, including natural, step-, adopted, minor, or disabled children who are dependent on the insured for support and maintenance. Similarly, a "child or covered child" refers to any such child.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, Vermont law grants civil union partners similar benefits, protections, and responsibilities as married couples under state law. However, federal laws like ERISA may not extend these benefits to parties in a civil union regarding private employer health plans. Government employers (excluding the federal government) must provide health benefits to civil union dependents if they offer them to spouses' dependents. Federal law also governs COBRA continuation rights for employers with 20 or more employees and Internal Revenue Code treatment of premiums. Consequently, parties in a civil union may have limited access to certain benefits under this policy due to federal laws. Washington residents should be aware that the definition of Surviving Spouse in the Survivor Income Benefit has been amended for them. It is advisable to seek expert advice to understand your rights under this contract.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, under General Work Stoppage, coverage is continued during a work stoppage (including strikes or lockouts) for up to six months from the date of termination.

According to the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on page 38 rows [2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], if you are disabled due to mental illness from any cause, a condition resulting from mental illness, alcoholism under treatment, or non-medical use of certain substances, your benefits will be limited. The maximum duration of these benefits is subject to the entire policy. You'll receive benefits for as long as you are hospitalized or at a medical care facility for that disability, or if not confined, for up to 24 months in total during your lifetime after discharge and continued disablement.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 38 and 39, if you become disabled and your earnings are 20% or lower compared to your indexed pre-disability earnings, your monthly disability benefit is calculated as follows: first, we multiply your pre-disability earnings by the benefit percentage (39%). Second, we compare this product with the maximum benefit. The lesser amount is then reduced by any other income benefits, resulting in your monthly benefit. This calculation ensures that you receive a suitable financial support during your disability period.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, during your disability, if you earn more than 20% of your Indexed Pre-disability Earnings, your Monthly Benefit will be calculated for up to 12 consecutive months as follows: multiply your Pre-disability Earnings by the Benefit Percentage, compare the result with the Maximum Benefit, deduct Other Income Benefits from the lesser amount, and this is your Monthly Benefit. Current Monthly Earnings will not reduce your Monthly Benefit, but if their sum exceeds 100% of Pre-disability Earnings, your Monthly Benefit will be reduced by the excess amount. This period begins on either the day you start earning more than 20%, or at the end of the Elimination Period. If you are not receiving benefits under the Return to Work Incentive and still earn more than 20%, your Monthly Benefit will be the greater of the Proportionate Loss Formula or the 50% Offset Formula. The document can be found on page numbers [39] rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2].
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, page 39 row 1, the policy outlines an Indexed Pre-disability Earnings benefit. If you become disabled, this monthly payment becomes due if your earnings do not exceed 20% of your pre-disability income. The benefit is indexed, meaning it adjusts over time based on changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This adjustment aims to maintain the purchasing power of your benefits and protect against inflation. The specific amount payable will be determined based on your pre-disability earnings. This provision applies only if you meet the policy's disability definition and qualifications.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 39, rows [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2], it is detailed that if the sum of your Monthly Benefit, Current Monthly Earnings, and Other Income Benefits surpasses 100% of your Pre-disability Earnings, a reduction in your Monthly Benefit will occur to account for the excess. However, your Monthly Benefit will never fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit. Also outlined is that, in case of overpayment, recovery measures may be taken according to the Overpayment Recovery provision.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, page 39, row 2, your Monthly Benefit under this policy will not fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit specified in the Schedule of Insurance.

The specific figure can be found within the Schedule of Insurance provided with your policy documents.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, if a Monthly Benefit is payable for a period of less than a month, the benefit will be calculated by dividing the Monthly Benefit by 30 and multiplying it by the number of days the policyholder was Disabled. For instance, if the Monthly Benefit is $1,000 and the policyholder was Disabled for 15 days, the payment would be ($1,000/30) * 15 = $250. This calculation applies to each instance of disability less than a month in duration.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf outlines the Family Care Credit Benefit.

The monthly deduction is $350 for the first 12 months of rehab, and $175 thereafter, but not exceeding your monthly earnings. The total annual deduction should not surpass $2,500. Proportional reductions apply for periods less than a month. Receipts from caregivers are necessary for validation. This benefit ceases when you're no longer in the rehab program or after 24 months of family care credits during your disability. Family care provided by relatives is not eligible for deduction under this provision. Your post-deduction monthly earnings determine your monthly benefit, and you'll only receive a monthly benefit if your current earnings before the deduction do not exceed 80% of your pre-disability earnings.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, if you are receiving a Monthly Disability Benefit and pass away, your survivors may receive a Survivor Income Benefit.

If you become disabled from such an illness, your pre-disability earnings for benefits will be either what you were earning at the time of providing proof from a physician or at the time of disability under this policy, whichever is greater. Benefits are calculated using these pre-disability earnings and all applicable terms in the policy. Until disability occurs, premiums are based on the greater of your pre-disability earnings under this benefit or the policy's original terms. Premiums will not drop below the rate at the time proof of Progressive Illness is submitted unless you qualify for Waiver of Premium under this policy.

For physicians, this means the general or sub-specialty you practice, with the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) determining the specialty or sub-specialty recognition. If your sub-specialty is not recognized by ABMS, you will be classified under the general specialty category. This definition applies to your occupation prior to any disability.

According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, the term "Spouse" can encompass your domestic partner under specific conditions:

1) Executing a domestic partner affidavit acceptable by the insurer, confirming that you and your partner are domestic partners in relation to this policy; or
2) Registering as domestic partners with an available government agency or office and presenting proof of registration, unless providing proof is against the law.

Continued adherence to legal requirements is necessary to maintain the status of a civil union. The Change in Family Status provision has been updated as follows: if you experience changes in your relationship status, promptly notify The Policy to avoid coverage issues. In case of disagreement regarding your partner's status as a surviving spouse or civil union partner, The Policy will look for evidence supporting each party's claim and make a decision based on this information.

Under the revised Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf policy, a recurrent disability must occur within six months if it's less than that period. The discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits and interpret the policy terms falls on the Company as claim fiduciary. This duty is solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries, subject to exhausting administrative remedies before seeking judicial review. The standard of review requires a participant or beneficiary to prove arbitrary and capricious or abusive discretion to prevail. Time periods for claim appeals are now 180 days if less than that duration. Arbitration has been removed from the policy. For New Jersey residents, the Change in Family Status provision has been replaced with new conditions. These changes affect the Long-Term Disability (LTD) benefits and claims process.

According to the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, on pages 57 rows 3-4 and subsequent rows up to 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, the term 'Surviving Spouse' encompasses either your lawfully wedded spouse or your domestic partner under specific conditions. To qualify as a domestic partner, you must have executed a domestic partner affidavit acceptable to the insurer, proving that you and your partner meet the policy's criteria, or register as domestic partners with a government agency where such registration is available. Continued compliance with the relevant law or affidavit requirements is essential to maintain this status. Notably, the Change in Family Status provision has been replaced with these conditions.

The policy provides a life insurance benefit, with an accelerated benefit option under certain conditions.

The benefit percentage for specific loss of limbs or sight varies, with up to 100% coverage for total loss. This coverage remains active until the policy term ends.
<EOS>

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on page 66, row 1, the basic life insurance amount is specified.

<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (page 67, rows 1-2), the coverage amount of your life insurance policy may be reduced by any insurance amounts payable under the Conversion Right. This means that if you exercise your conversion privilege, the total insurance amount provided for you will be diminished to reflect the new insurance amounts resulting from such conversion.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (page 67, rows [1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), your life insurance and principal sum coverage will experience a reduction based on the table provided. This reduction takes effect on the Policy Anniversary Date subsequent to you reaching the ages detailed below. The reduction applies to both the Amount of Life Insurance and Principal Sum in force prior to this date. If you acquire coverage under The Policy or your coverage increases, reductions will occur after age 65. The percentage by which your current coverage (post any previous reductions) is reduced is also specified.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 67 (rows 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2), the reduction in coverage percentage is as follows: 35% for limits between 65 and 90, and 25% for the limit at 95.

<EOS>
Under the Waiver of Premium provision in Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, if you become disabled and qualify, your life insurance coverage continues without premium payments. The continued coverage amount is the one in force on the date you cease being an active employee, subject to any reductions stipulated by the policy. This amount will not increase, and it remains subject to any applicable policy provisions.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, page 69, row 2, this policy covers only Your Basic Life Insurance. The coverage eligibility is limited to this single life insurance product. This provision does not extend to any other insurance types or policies. The details regarding the coverage, exclusions, and limits are outlined in the respective sections of your policy document.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 69 (rows 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1), an individual is considered Disabled when they are prevented by injury or sickness from performing any work for which they could be qualified by education, training, or experience. Additionally, the individual must have a life expectancy of 12 months or less due to their condition. This definition applies regardless of whether the individual has previously worked or not.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, you can qualify for the Waiver of Premium provision if you meet three conditions: firstly, you must be under age 60 and covered under the policy when you become disabled; secondly, you must provide proof that you have been disabled for six consecutive months, starting from your last day of active employment; this proof should be submitted within one year of your last day as an active employee. Lastly, you must have been actively at work under the policy to qualify for Waiver of Premium.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (pages 69 and 70, rows 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4) outlines when premiums will be waived. Premium waiver begins after a period of initial disability, but not before the first 6 months of disability. The insurer can request proof of disability and may require examinations during the first two years, not more than once annually thereafter. Failure to provide proof or refusal to be examined ceases premium waiver. If the application for waiver is denied, conversion coverage is available. Returning to work for less than 5 days within the first 6 months of disability does not interrupt the waiting period, but a new period is required if working for more than 5 days. The total disability period should be due to the same condition.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, if you pass away within a year following your last day as an Active Employee but prior to qualifying for the Waiver of Premium, your insurance policy's active amount will be paid out, contingent on:

1. You having been continuously disabled for six months or more.
2. Premiums being consistently paid for coverage during this period.
3. Your disability persisting and rendering you unable to work.

These conditions are essential for the payment of the policy in such a scenario.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 70 rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4], if you are disabled and receive premium waiver, coverage continues until Normal Retirement Age if you become disabled before age 60. Once the waiver ceases, you may regain eligibility for coverage by returning to work in an Eligible Class as an Active Employee while paying premiums on time. Alternatively, if you do not return to such employment, coverage terminates and you might be eligible to exercise the Conversion Right, provided it's done within specified time limits. The convertible Life Insurance amount is subject to Conversion Right terms and conditions.
<EOS>
Under the terms of the Hartford Cert 5387491 policy, if your employment ends before qualifying for Waiver of Premium, you may convert your policy within specified time limits, and could still potentially qualify for the Waiver provision. If your employment ceases after qualifying for Waiver of Premium, your coverage will remain unchanged. In all instances, it's crucial to follow the conversion timelines and eligibility criteria as outlined in the policy document.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 70, rows 2, 3, and 1, the Life Insurance Benefit becomes payable upon proof of your death while under The Policy coverage. Proof of Loss must be submitted in accordance with the policy's Proof of Loss provision. The payment will adhere to the General Provisions of The Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages [70, 71], an Accelerated Benefit is provided if the policyholder is diagnosed terminally ill and aged under 60 with at least $10,000 coverage. The payable amount ranges from $3,000 to $500,000 but cannot exceed 80% of the insurance amount. Requests for this benefit must be made in writing, and once exercised, the death benefit is reduced accordingly. The policyholder may only exercise this option once, and a person proving terminal illness will also qualify for Waiver of Premium. Additionally, if a government agency or law requires accelerated benefits to meet claims of creditors or qualify for government benefits, the terms and conditions still apply. In case of an assignment of rights, the assignee must release their claim before benefits are payable.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf stipulates that proof of terminal illness may be required consistently throughout the policy term. Any diagnosis must originate from a physician. Failure to provide such proof or refusal to undergo a physical examination as requested will prevent the payment of an accelerated benefit.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on page 71, if a policyholder is no longer terminally ill, coverage continues as follows: If the policyholder returns to an Eligible Class and pays premiums, coverage remains in force. If the policyholder does not return to an Eligible Class but remains disabled (subject to Waiver of Premium provision), coverage persists. However, if the policyholder is neither in an Eligible Class nor disabled, coverage ends. In this case, the policyholder may exercise the Conversion Right within specified limits, but coverage will be reduced by any Accelerated Benefit paid.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, if your Life Insurance coverage or any portion under the policy ends for any reason, you may have the right to convert it into an individual conversion policy without providing Evidence of Insurability. However, this option is not available for Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefits or any ineligible amount of Life Insurance covered under the policy.

If coverage ends due to termination of the policy, cessation of coverage for an Eligible Class, or your employer no longer being a Participating Employer, you must have been insured under the policy for at least 5 years to be eligible for conversion. The maximum amount that can be converted in these situations is the lesser of $10,000 or the Life Insurance Benefit under the policy, less any group life insurance coverage you may become eligible for within 31 days of termination.

If the coverage ends for any other reason, the full amount of ended coverage can be converted. Notably, conversion is not available for portions of the policy that were ineligible or for Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefits.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf pages 71 and 72, the term 'Insurer' refers to either us or another insurance company that has agreed to issue conversion policies based on this Conversion Right. This agreement enables you to convert your policy to a new one under similar terms without providing evidence of insurability, subject to certain conditions. The conversion must occur within 364 days after the termination or maturity date of your current policy. Additionally, the new policy's premium rates will be based on the age and risk classification applicable at the time of the conversion.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf indicates that to convert your coverage, you must complete a Notice of Conversion Right form and have your employer sign it. The form should reach the insurer within 31 days after life insurance termination or 15 days from your employer signing the form, whichever is later, but not more than 91 days post-termination. After eligibility confirmation, you'll receive a Conversion Policy proposal requiring completion and premium payment as specified. Any individual policy issued will be effective on the 32nd day after coverage ends, replacing previous coverage for that amount under the policy.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on page 72, the Conversion Policy provisions include:

1. The policy will be issued using one of the Insurer's current forms for conversion purposes at the time of conversion.
2. Premiums will be based on the Insurer's rates for new applicants of the same class and age at the time of conversion.
3. The Conversion Policy will not offer the same coverage terms, additional benefits, or term insurance as the original policy.
4. Conversion is not available for any amount of life insurance being continued under the Waiver of Premium provision or the Continuation Provisions until such coverage ceases.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 72, rows 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, and 2, if your coverage under the policy terminates and you die within 31 days of that termination date, provided we receive Proof of Loss, we will pay the amount of life insurance you would have been eligible to apply for under this conversion provision. However, if a conversion policy has already taken effect, no life insurance benefit will be payable under the policy for the converted amount.
<EOS>
Under the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit outlined in Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf (page 72, rows 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2), if you sustain an injury within 365 days of an accident resulting in specific losses, the insurer will pay the stated Principal Sum or a portion thereof upon receipt of Proof of Loss. This payment adheres to the General Policy provisions. The insurer will not compensate more than the Principal Sum for all losses stemming from the same accident. Your Principal Sum is indicated in the policy's Schedule of Insurance.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, the policy benefit details various scenarios of disability and their corresponding payouts. The principal sum is at stake in events such as total loss (both hands, both feet, or sight of both eyes), one-hand-one-foot, speech and hearing loss in both ears, loss of either hand or foot and sight of one eye, quadriplegia, paraplegia, triplegia affecting three limbs, hemiplegia affecting one side of the body, loss of a single limb, thumb and index finger of either hand, or any quarter of the principal sum based on these circumstances. Payouts range from the full amount to as little as a quarter. Specifically, total disability results in the full payout, while losing a single limb, sight of one eye, speech or hearing in one ear, or just the thumb and index finger each result in half the principal sum, and any lesser loss results in a quarter of the principal sum.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages [73] rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2], an additional Seat Belt and Air Bag Benefit is payable when you sustain an injury resulting in a loss covered under the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit. This benefit applies if you were either a passenger wearing a seat belt or the licensed operator of a properly registered motor vehicle, with proof on the police accident report.

The Seat Belt Benefit is the lesser of an amount resulting from multiplying your Principal Sum by the Seat Belt Benefit Percentage, or the Maximum Amount for this benefit. Similarly, the Air Bag Benefit is the lesser of an amount resulting from multiplying your Principal Sum by the Air Bag Benefit Percentage, or the Maximum Amount for this benefit. This benefit is payable after proof of loss and in accordance with the General Provisions of The Policy.

If it cannot be determined whether you were wearing a seat belt at the time of the accident, a Minimum Benefit will be payable under the Seat Belt Benefit, provided you were positioned in a seat equipped with an airbag and properly strapped in when the airbag inflated.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, an 'Accident' is defined solely for the purpose of this Benefit as an unintentional collision of a Motor Vehicle, provided that the policyholder was wearing a Seat Belt during the incident.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, a Seat Belt refers to an unaltered belt or lap and shoulder restraint installed by the Motor Vehicle's manufacturer.

This benefit applies only to the Vehicle or proper replacement parts installed in accordance with the Motor Vehicle’s manufacturer's specifications.

This benefit is paid upon receiving Proof of Loss, in accordance with the Policy's Proof of Loss provision, and according to its General Provisions.

For Wisconsin residents, the Conversion Right amount changes to $5,000, and the claims payment amounts alter to $1,000, if not already at these levels.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages 80, rows 2-4 and 1-2 of subsequent rows, dependents are defined as your spouse and dependent child(ren). A dependent must be a U.S. citizen or reside in its territories and protectorates. However, full-time military personnel can't be dependents unless they are subsequently called to military service, with the necessary premium paid. The age limit for continuation of dependent children with disabilities is increased to 21 if under 21. Furthermore, an additional provision has been made regarding the period of coverage for such cases. It is crucial to note that these provisions apply only to this specific policy.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf details coverage reinstatement and modifications after military service. Coverage terminates upon entering active military service, but if you're rehired within 12 months of this termination or return, both you and your dependent spouse/dependents can have coverage reinstated if requested within 31 days of returning to work. The reinstated coverage maintains the same coverage amounts as before, without any waiting period, evidence of insurability, or pre-existing condition limitations, but is subject to the policy's terms.

The Life Insurance Benefit might pay up to $500 to a person equitably entitled for funeral or illness-related expenses upon your death. The Seatbelt and Air Bag benefit exclusion now applies if the injured person is operating the vehicle while intoxicated or under the influence of narcotics, unless prescribed by a physician.

Injury sustained while under the influence of narcotics (except when administered on a doctor's advice) is excluded from the Accidental Death and Dismemberment benefits. For Massachusetts residents, the definition of Terminal Illness or Terminally Ill cannot exceed 24 months, while Michigan residents see the deletion of the Policy Interpretation provision, and Minnesota residents note changes in the Military Leave of Absence section of the Continuation provision.
<EOS>
In Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, under section 2, the provision titled "Lay Off" has been removed from the Continuation Provisions and replaced with a new one pertaining to "Documented Military Leave of Absence." This amendment is detailed on page 80, rows 1-2. The revised section now states that coverage can be suspended during a documented military leave of absence for up to 180 days without incurring additional costs or affecting policy term. Upon return from leave, the policy resumes with no changes, provided the employee returns to their original job position within the specified period.
<EOS>
In the event of your voluntary or involuntary termination or layoff as detailed in Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf pages [80, 81], you have the option to continue coverage by paying monthly premiums to the employer. You must elect this within 60 days from either the date your coverage ends or when you receive written notice of your right to continue coverage, whichever is later. The maximum premium charged cannot exceed 102% of the premium paid for active employee life insurance coverage.

The employer will inform you about your right to continue coverage, the monthly premium amount, and the payment method. Upon request, they will provide a written verification of the cost of coverage. Coverage continues until either another group policy is in effect or 18 months following termination/layoff. At this point, you may exercise the conversion right, although an option for reduced benefits at a lower premium rate is also available.

Minnesota law states that if your coverage ends due to employer failure to notify you of continued coverage options or non-payment of timely received premiums, the employer will be liable for benefit payments up to the amount We would have been liable had you remained covered. A reduction in work hours resulting in loss of coverage is considered a layoff. Termination does not include discharge for gross misconduct but includes retirement.

Specific paragraphs related to Accelerated Benefit, Conversion Right, and Claims to be Paid have been amended or deleted, as noted in the document. Additionally, if benefits exceed $15,000, they can be paid into a draft book account owned by either you (if living) or your beneficiary (in case of death). For Missouri residents, certain time periods mentioned in the document have specific adjustments.
<EOS>
In accordance with the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf at pages 81 rows [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2], when a Waiver of Premium is approved, it will be retroactive to the onset of disability and premiums will only be waived retrospectively after completion of a 180-day waiting period. Furthermore, a revised Suicide provision has been implemented, replacing the previous one.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf policy section outlines the stipulations regarding suicide-related claims. If death occurs due to suicide within a year of coverage, no Supplemental Life Insurance or Dependent Life Insurance benefits will be paid for coverage elected during this period.

The Accidental Death and Dismemberment Exclusions now include suicide or attempted suicide. For Montana residents, changes to the Conversion Right provision are as follows: the time period is extended to 3 years if greater than 3 years; the dollar amount is adjusted to $10,000 if less than that amount; and the second paragraph of the Conversion Policy Provisions is deleted.

Additionally, the dollar amount stated in the Claims to be Paid provision is modified to $500 if it was not already $500, and an additional provision regarding claims is added.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf policy section on pages [81, 82] outlines several provisions. Death claims will be paid within 60 days of proof submission, with interest accrued if payment is made over 30 days later, calculated at the discount rate for 90-day commercial paper effective at the Federal Reserve Bank in the Ninth District on the proof submission date. For New Hampshire residents, modifications include deleting certain provisions and adding others to the Waiver of Premium and Disability Extension, Conversion, Sending Proof of Loss, and Claims to be Paid sections, as well as adjustments to the Period of Coverage if Spouse Accidental Death and Dismemberment is included.

Certain exceptions apply: for North Dakota residents, coverage excludes suicide within the first year of or after an increase in coverage; for Ohio residents, "Accelerated Benefit" is amended to "Accelerated Death Benefit"; and for Oregon residents, the definition of spouse is amended as specified.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf on pages [82, 83] defines 'Spouse' as an individual who is under 65 years old, not legally separated or divorced, and not in active full-time military service outside specified areas.

The term 'Spouse' may also include a domestic partner if specific conditions are met, such as executing a domestic partner affidavit or registering as domestic partners with a government agency where available. This status persists as long as the requirements are maintained.

Additionally, Dependent Child(ren) now includes children of an Oregon registered domestic partner. The Continuation Provisions section for Employers with 10 or more employees has been amended to allow coverage continuation during Jury Duty, subject to certain conditions and notification policies.

This Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf section outlines the disability coverage continuation rules. Coverage may be prolonged past a termination date, but not under multiple continuation provisions. The amount of continued coverage matches the coverage in effect before termination and lasts until the earliest of six months from disability onset, approval for extended coverage under applicable policy provisions, unpaid premium due dates, policy termination, or trust-based employer ceasing participation. Vermont residents are subject to an additional endorsement with a maximum combined continuation period of twelve consecutive months if absence leads to family and medical leave in accordance with state and federal laws. No insurance increase is allowed during this continuation period, and the continuation provisions cannot be applied consecutively.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, this endorsement offers benefits to parties in a Vermont civil union and their families. The civil union must be established according to Vermont law for eligibility. Insurance contracts and policies initially designed for married persons and their families are made available under this provision.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, the policy's definitions of terms like "marriage", "spouse", "dependent", "family", and related phrases now include civil unions.

The term "dependent" encompasses a spouse, party to a civil union, and/or child (natural, stepchild, legally adopted, or minor dependent) born or brought into the union.

<EOS>
This insurance policy update from Hartford Cert 5387491 specifies that in case of a disagreement between the policyholder's attending physician and one appointed by the insurer regarding terminal illness, both parties must strive to resolve it amicably. If unresolved, mediation or binding arbitration by an impartial third party can be opted for, with proceedings conducted under Washington State law. The arbitrator or mediator may allocate the costs to either party or divide them equally.

In case of a labor dispute impacting the policyholder's work, all coverages (including Dependent Life) are extended during the dispute up to six months. This extension ceases immediately upon resolution of the labor dispute. The Policy Interpretation provision has been removed entirely.

The definition of Dependent Child(ren) now includes those from domestic partnerships. The Spouse definition has been modified, and the labor dispute continuation provision has been amended to account for this situation.

If your benefits claim is denied or ignored, you can file a lawsuit in state or Federal court. However, if administrative appeals are required before filing in court, failure to complete them might impact your right to sue. If Plan fiduciaries misuse funds or discriminate against rights assertion, you may seek help from the U.S. Department of Labor or file suit in Federal court.

If unsuccessful, you may be ordered to pay these costs and fees if your claim is found frivolous.
