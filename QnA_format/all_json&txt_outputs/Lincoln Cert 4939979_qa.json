Any such exam will be at the Company's expense. The Company may determine that (in its opinion) the Insured Employee has: 1. failed to cooperate with an examiner; 2. failed to take an exam scheduled by the Company; or 3. postponed such an exam more than twice. In that event, benefits may be denied or suspended, until the required exam is completed. TIME OF PAYMENT OF CLAIMS.

Any benefits will be paid monthly, during any period for which the Company is liable.  If benefits are due for less than a month, they will be paid on a pro rata basis.  The daily rate will equal 1/30 of the Monthly Benefit. 2.

Other parts of this Certificate contain definitions specific to those provisions. ACTIVE WORK  or  ACTIVELY-AT-WORK  means an Employee's full-time performance of all main duties of such Employee's occupation at: 1. the Employer's usual place of business; or 2. any other business location to which the Employer requires the Employee to travel. Unless Disabled on the prior workday or on the day of absence, an Employee will be considered Actively at Work on the following days: 1. a Saturday, Sunday or holiday which is not a scheduled workday; 2. a paid vacation day or other scheduled or unscheduled non-workday; or 3. an excused or emergency leave of absence (except a medical leave) of 30 days or less. BASIC MONTHLY EARNINGS  or  PREDISABILITY INCOME  means the Insured Employee's average monthly base salary or hourly pay from the Employer before taxes on the Determination Date.  The \"Determination Date\" is the last day worked just prior to the date the Disability begins. It also includes: 1. Primary Care compensation average over the 12 months just prior to the Determination Date; or over the actual period of employment with the Employer just prior to that date, if shorter; and 2. any earnings from the Performance Incentive Plan averaged over the 12 months just prior to the Determination Date; or over the actual period of employment with the Employer just prior to that date, if shorter. It does  not  include commissions, bonuses, overtime pay, or any other extra compensation.  It does not include income from a source other than the Employer.  It will not exceed the amount shown in the Employer's financial records, the amount for which premium has been paid, or the Maximum Covered Monthly Earnings permitted by the Policy; whichever is less.
