According to the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on page 44 rows [2, 1, 2, 3, 1], coverage begins when you become eligible, except for any coverage requiring Evidence of Insurability, which becomes effective either upon your eligibility or upon our approval of the Evidence of Insurability. All effective dates are subject to a Deferred Effective Date provision. In all cases, the specific effective date depends on the requirements for each coverage type.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on page 11 rows [2-14], your insurance coverage or increase in coverage will not become effective immediately if you are absent from work due to accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse, or pregnancy. Instead, the coverage will only begin when you return to active work for a full day. This deferred effective date applies regardless of the intended start date of your insurance or increased coverage.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf pages [11, 12], policyholders may decrease or increase coverage, with higher options subject to application approval and conditions such as a deferred effective date and pre-existing condition limitations. Coverage adjustments occur due to changes in class or rate of pay, effective on the change date if the policyholder is an active employee not absent due to disability. Increases will be deferred if the policyholder was disabled during the change period, becoming effective only after a full day back at work. Increases are subject to the Guaranteed Issue Amount, with subsequent increases exempt from Evidence of Insurability requirements unless the increase is 10% or more in any single occurrence or it has been 3 years since the last approved Evidence of Insurability. Changes in pre-disability earnings take effect upon notice to the insurer. Additionally, any policy changes due to a change in the policy itself become effective on the date of change, subject to deferred effective dates and pre-existing condition limitations.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, if you were previously insured under a Prior Policy and ineligible for benefits on the day before the Participating Employer Effective Date, there will be no Deferred Effective Date provision. The Pre-existing Condition Limitation (PCL) will only apply if you become covered under the new policy on the Participating Employer Effective Date, having been previously covered under the Prior Policy the day before. If your disability coverage was not limited by a pre-existing condition restriction in the Prior Policy, or if it was but would have ceased to apply had the Prior Policy remained in force, the PCL will end on the Participating Employer Effective Date.

The Monthly Benefit for a Pre-existing Condition under the new policy will be the lesser of either the Monthly Benefit provided by the Prior Policy or the Monthy Benefit offered by The Policy. Additionally, the PCL applies to any benefit increase resulting from changing policies, options, class, or The Policy itself.

If you were disabled under the Prior Policy and returned to work as a Full-time Active Employee before the Participating Employer Effective Date, and within 6 months of your return, have a recurrence of the same disability while covered under The Policy with no benefits available for the recurrence under the Prior Policy, the Elimination Period will be waived if the recurrence would have been covered without any further elimination period under the Prior Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, your insurance coverage will terminate on the earliest occasion of:

1. The policy's termination date,
2. the point at which the policy no longer covers your class,
3. if premium payment is overdue,
4. the last day of the premium period,
5. your employer ending your employment,
6. you ceasing to be a full-time active employee in an eligible class for any reason, or
7. your employer's status as a Participating Employer ceases; unless extended through Continuation Provisions.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 12 and 13, coverage can be continued beyond its termination date if the employer provides a plan applicable to all employees equally. Continued coverage is subject to reductions in The Policy, employer premium payments, and terminates when the policy terminates, the employer ceases to be a Participating Employer, or coverage for your class terminates.

Your benefit level will remain as it was before continuation. If your spouse or child serves active military duty outside of specific regions and you meet certain criteria, your coverage may be continued for up to 15 days. For Family Medical Leave or sabbatical, coverage can be continued for up to 8 weeks or 26 weeks if you also qualify for Military Leave, extending longer as per applicable law. If the leave ends prematurely, continuation ceases immediately. Sabbatical coverage continuation requires pre-approval if the leave exceeds 30 days.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (page 13, rows 2-6), if you become disabled and cease being an active employee, your insurance coverage continues: first, during the Elimination Period as long as you remain disabled by the same disability; second, beyond the Elimination Period, for as long as you are entitled to benefits under the policy. The Elimination Period is not specified within these rows but is subject to the provisions of the policy.
<EOS>
According to the Waiver of Premium section in Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 13 (rows 2-6), no premium will be required after the Elimination Period and for as long as benefits are payable. This means that, following the Elimination Period, you won't have to make payments while receiving benefits under this policy. The Elimination Period is not specified in these details.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, if you are entitled to benefits due to total disability and your participating employer's coverage terminates, your benefits will continue as long as your disability persists by the same condition. However, these benefits will not extend beyond the date when we would have stopped paying benefits had the insurance remained active. The termination of your participating employer's coverage for any reason will not affect our liability under this provision. In essence, your benefits will be contingent upon you remaining disabled and would cease at the same point as if the insurance had continued.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, if your insurance ends due to non-retirement employment termination or ineligibility for an eligible class, and you've been insured continuously for at least 12 months, are not disabled, the policy is active, and have no similar coverage under another group policy, you're eligible for a group long term disability conversion policy. To enroll, submit a written request within 31 days of your insurance termination along with the required premium and enrollment fee. Eligible applicants will receive a certificate of insurance effective from the day after their previous policy terminates. The coverage may differ from the original policy, with terms determined based on available conversion policy options at the time of enrollment request.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, disability benefits are payable under the policy if you become disabled while insured and meet specific requirements: a) you must be disabled throughout the Elimination Period, b) remain disabled beyond this period, c) submit Proof of Loss to the company, and d) ensure that payments do not exceed the Maximum Duration of Benefits. Benefits commence on the first day following the Elimination Period and are paid monthly thereafter.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, specific limitations apply to benefits for disabilities caused by mental illness, substance abuse, or their related conditions. Disabilities stemming from mental illness, its consequences, alcoholism under treatment, or non-medical use of certain substances may result in a capped duration of benefits. Benefits will be paid for either the duration of confinement in a medical facility or up to 24 months if not confined, with a total of 24 months for all such disabilities throughout one's lifetime.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, during the elimination period, days spent recovering but returning to work less than half the duration of the elimination period won't extend the period. If you become disabled again within 180 days due to the same or a related cause while the policy remains active, the initial and recurrent disabilities will be considered as one period. Conversely, if you remain non-disabled for 180 days or more, any subsequent disability is treated as new, subject to a fresh elimination period and maximum duration of benefits, and all current policy terms and conditions.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, Page 15 Row 1, the Period of Disability refers to a continuous stretch during which you are considered disabled under the policy. This duration is significant as it determines your eligibility for benefits under the insurance policy. To qualify, the disability must be sustained continuously without interruption until the end of the specified period or until you meet the policy's definition of recovery. The length and conditions of this period may vary depending on the specific terms and conditions of the policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, page 15, row 2, "Recover" or "Recovery" denotes a state where the insured is no longer disabled and has resumed working with the original employer. This return triggers the cessation of premium payments for the insured. The document does not specify further details regarding the duration or conditions under which premiums may resume after recovery.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, if your disability continues beyond the Elimination Period and you earn 20% or less of your indexed pre-disability earnings, your monthly disability benefit will be calculated as follows: First, multiply your pre-disability earnings by the Benefit Percentage. Second, compare this product with the Maximum Benefit. Lastly, from the lesser amount, deduct any Other Income Benefits to arrive at your Monthly Benefit.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf document on page 15 (rows 2-12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), the calculation of disability benefits is detailed when you're earning more than 20% of your indexed pre-disability earnings after the elimination period. During a 12-month period, the monthly benefit is calculated by multiplying your pre-disability earnings by the benefit percentage, comparing the result with the maximum benefit, and deducting other income benefits. If this sum exceeds 100% of your pre-disability earnings, your monthly benefit will be reduced. The 12-month period begins either on the day you start earning more than 20% or at the end of the elimination period. If you aren't receiving Return to Work Incentive benefits and still earn more than 20%, your monthly benefit will be calculated as the greater of two formulas: the Proportionate Loss Formula or the 50% Offset Formula.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (page 15, row 5), the policy outlines an Indexed Pre-disability Earnings provision. If you become disabled and your earnings are less than 20% of your pre-disability income, you will receive a monthly benefit based on this indexed amount, which adjusts for inflation annually. The index used is the Consumer Price Index (CPI) with a maximum increase of 6%. The indexing begins after the first 24 consecutive months of disability. This provision applies only to your base policy and not any riders or additional coverages you may have.
<EOS>
In the policy outlined in Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, excess income may reduce the Monthly Benefit received. If the sum of your Monthly Benefit, Current Monthly Earnings, and Other Income Benefits surpasses 100% of your Pre-disability Earnings, a reduction in your Monthly Benefit will occur, proportional to the excess. This reduction will not bring the Monthly Benefit below the Minimum Monthly Benefit. Overpayment may also trigger overpayment recovery in accordance with policy provisions. It is crucial to note that if your Monthly Benefit becomes less than the Minimum Monthly Benefit due to income reductions, we will not reduce it further.
<EOS>
As per the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, page 15, row 2, your monthly benefit under this policy will not fall below the Minimum Monthly Benefit specified in the Schedule of Insurance. This guarantee ensures a certain level of financial aid to you throughout the term of the insurance. The minimum amount is outlined clearly within the schedule itself and forms an essential part of the coverage you've chosen.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 15 and 16, if the Monthly Benefit is payable for a period less than a month, the benefit will be calculated as one-thirtieth of the Monthly Benefit for each day of disability. This means that for every day you are disabled, you will receive 1/30 of your monthly benefit.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, your benefit payments may cease on any of the following conditions: if you are no longer disabled, fail to provide Proof of Loss, stop receiving regular medical care, refuse a requested examination, pass away, reach the maximum duration of benefits as specified in the table, or have current monthly earnings exceeding 80% of your indexed pre-disability earnings (if disabled from occupation). Additionally, benefit payments may terminate if no further benefits are payable under any provision with duration limits in the policy.
<EOS>
In Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, Family Care Credit Benefit details allow deductions for care expenses when in a Rehabilitation program. These expenses are for the supervision of children under age 13 or a mentally/physically handicapped dependent at home. The maximum monthly deduction for each qualifying child or family member is $350 during the first 12 months, then $175 thereafter, not exceeding earnings. Family Care Credits can't surpass $2,500 yearly and are reduced proportionally for periods under a month. Receipts from caregivers are required, and credits cease after 24 months or when no longer in the Rehabilitation program. No family-related care is eligible as a deduction. The remaining earnings after Family Care Credit deduction determine the monthly benefit, with eligibility ceasing if current monthly earnings exceed 80% of pre-disability earnings.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (page 16, rows [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 1]), if you are receiving Monthly Disability Benefits and die, your survivors will receive a Survivor Income Benefit. This benefit is payable upon providing satisfactory proof of death and the claimant's entitlement within one year of your death.

The Survivor Income Benefit is three times your Maximum Monthly Benefit. It is paid to your surviving spouse if any, or equally to your children if no spouse survives. If there are no surviving spouse or children, the benefit goes to your estate. Any overpayment on your claim will be deducted first before payment of the Survivor Income Benefit. The proof of entitlement and death must be provided within a year after your demise for the benefit to be paid out.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, a Surviving Spouse is defined as the legally married partner at the time of death, excluding those who were divorced or separated. To consider your domestic partner or civil union partner, you must either: execute a domestic partner affidavit confirming your partnership for The Policy, or register as such with a government agency where registration is available and provide proof (unless law prohibits this). Continued recognition as domestic partners depends on meeting the criteria set in the affidavit or by applicable law.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, Surviving Children are defined as unmarried offspring, stepchildren, or legally adopted children who rely on the policyholder for support and maintenance. They must either be under age 21 or between ages 21-25 and enrolled full-time in an educational institution. This term also includes any blood-related or related through marriage or domestic partnership children living with the policyholder in a regular parent-child relationship, who were eligible to be claimed as dependents on the policyholder's federal income tax return for the preceding year. Minor children may receive benefit payments via a caregiver until a legal guardian is appointed. If a minor child is entitled to benefits, payment can be made to the caregiver at the insurer's discretion.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, this policy includes a Workplace Modification Benefit. If your disability is covered and your employer agrees to make reasonable modifications for your return to work, the insurer will reimburse these costs, up to the amount of the Maximum Monthly Benefit. To qualify, proposed modifications must be approved in writing. The insurer may evaluate appropriateness through examinations or evaluations by chosen physicians, vocational experts, or rehabilitation specialists. Reimbursement occurs after the modifications are completed, proof of expenses is provided, and you return as an Active Employee.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 17, rows 2 and 3, Workplace Modification refers to alterations in your work environment or job methods to accommodate you while disabled. This modification allows you to perform the essential duties of your job. Payment of this benefit will not affect any benefits you're eligible for under The Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (pages 17, rows 2-3), if you are diagnosed with a Progressive Illness after being covered for this benefit under the policy and provide satisfactory proof from your Physician, you will become eligible for the Progressive Illness Benefit. The details of this benefit aren't explicitly stated in these sections, but it seems that it is contingent upon meeting the conditions mentioned above.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf policy detail (rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2] on pages [17, 18]) discusses Progressive Illness disability benefits. If you become disabled due to a noninfectious, indefinite disease, your pre-disability earnings will be the greater of the amount at the time of physician-verified proof or at the time of disability. Benefits are calculated using this determined earnings and adhering to policy terms effective on the disability date. Until disabled, premiums are based on the greater of pre-disability earnings under this benefit or under the policy. Your premium will not drop below the amount paid at proof submission, except with Waiver of Premium qualification.
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, during your coverage period, if you suffer an accidental bodily injury leading to dismemberment or loss of sight within 365 days after the accident, a monthly benefit will be paid, starting from the Elimination Period. The duration and corresponding benefits are as follows:

- Loss of sight in one eye: 40% of the monthly benefit for life
- Loss of sight in both eyes: 100% of the monthly benefit for life
- Loss of a hand or foot at or above the wrist/ankle joint: 60% of the monthly benefit for life
- Loss of two hands, feet, or eyes: 150% of the monthly benefit for life
- Loss of one hand and one foot or any combination of limbs and sight totaling to two losses mentioned above: 200% of the monthly benefit for life
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on page 18, row numbers [2-12], this policy outlines various scenarios for vision loss compensation. It includes total and partial loss of both eyes (payable up to $100,000 each), as well as the partial loss of one hand and one eye, or one foot and one eye (both payable up to $75,000 each). Furthermore, the policy also covers the loss of one hand or one foot (each payable up to $60,000), with the exception that if both are lost within 90 days, the benefit amount is increased to $100,000. Additionally, the policy provides a lesser payment for temporary total vision loss (up to 26 weeks) or partial permanent vision loss (up to 5% of the total amount, up to a maximum of $4,687.50).
<EOS>
In accordance with the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on page 18, the policy outlines the monthly benefit for the loss of the thumb and index finger of either hand. The benefit is computed as the lesser of two figures: (i) the Maximum Monthly Benefit specified in the Schedule of Insurance or (ii) the insured's Pre-disability Earnings multiplied by the Benefit Percentage. To be eligible for this coverage, the loss must result from an accident occurring during the term of the policy. The Benefit Percentage is 60% for the thumb and 40% for the index finger. These percentages may vary based on the specific terms of the policy.
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 50 rows [2-9], a loss is defined in terms of specific bodily injuries: 1) complete and irreversible paralysis or actual severance above the wrist or ankle joints for hands, feet; 2) entire and irrecoverable loss of sight, speech, or hearing; 3) actual severance above the metacarpophalangeal joints for thumb and index finger. These incidents must result in a complete incapacity to engage in any occupation for which you are suited by education, training, or experience.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, benefits will not be paid for the following disabilities: (1) those not under regular medical care; (2) caused or worsened by war or act of war, (3) resulting from attempted or committed felonies, (4) associated with illegal occupations, or (5) self-inflicted injuries. If you previously received disability benefits from an employer-sponsored plan that terminated prior to this policy's effective date, no additional benefits will be payable for the same disability under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, page 18, rows 2-3, benefits for disabilities caused or worsened by pre-existing conditions may not be paid unless the disability arises after you have been insured for a period of at least 90 days without a break and during which you have complied with all required examinations, reports, or questions about your health. Pre-existing conditions are defined as any medical condition for which you received treatment, consultation, care, or took prescribed drugs within the 12 months prior to your effective date of coverage. Any preexisting conditions that meet these criteria will be subject to a six-month waiting period during which we do not pay benefits related to that condition. After this waiting period, we may only pay benefits for a portion of the costs associated with a preexisting condition up to a maximum of 50% of the total benefits paid for all disabilities.
<EOS>
According to the terms of The Policy outlined in Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 19, row numbers [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], there are two key conditions for eligibility:

1. If you have not received any medical care related to the covered condition for a continuous period of three months while being insured under The Policy.
2. Alternatively, if you have been continuously insured under The Policy for a consecutive twelve-month duration.

These conditions are crucial in determining your status and benefits under this policy.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (page 19, rows 2-11), a pre-existing condition is defined as any accidental bodily injury, sickness (including mental illness), pregnancy, or episode of substance abuse for which medical care was received during the 3 months prior to either your effective date of coverage or the effective date of a change in coverage. Any manifestations, symptoms, findings, or aggravations related to these conditions are also considered pre-existing. This means that these conditions will not be covered by the policy if they occurred before the specified dates.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, Medical Care is covered under the following conditions: a healthcare provider must either consult or offer advice, or recommend, prescribe, or provide treatment. This care can be in-person or virtual, and it includes diagnostic tests, surgical procedures, hospital stays, and prescription drugs. The policy also covers follow-up care for an existing condition and outpatient care. Importantly, the insurance will pay up to 80% of the reasonable and customary costs, with the insured responsible for the remaining 20%.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, treatment under this policy encompasses medical examinations, tests, attendance, or observation as well as the utilization of drugs, medicines, medical services, supplies, and equipment. This includes but is not limited to necessary procedures, consultations with healthcare professionals, prescriptions, hospital stays, surgical interventions, diagnostic imaging, lab work, durable medical equipment, and home health care services. These treatments may be subject to approval and coordination of benefits if other insurance coverage is available.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, you or the benefits recipient must provide written notice of a claim within 30 days after either the date of death or the loss occurrence. If timely notice cannot be given, it should be submitted as soon as possible thereafter. The notice should include the claimant's name, address, and the Participating Employer Account Number. Failure to do so may affect your coverage.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, pages 52 rows 2-4, if a claim is made, we will provide the claimant with Proof of Loss forms within 15 days. Should we fail to do so within this timeframe, the claimant may submit any other written evidence fully describing their claim's nature and extent. This document specifies that the required notice period for form submission is 15 days.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 19 [2-36], proof of disability claim may include the date and cause of disability, prognosis, pre-disability earnings, tax returns, medical information, consulted physicians/facilities, prescribing pharmacies within three years, authorization for releasing medical, employment, and financial data, identification of other income benefits, proof thereof, and evidence of applying for other available income benefits. The submitted proof must be satisfactory to the insurance company, and claimants are not required to claim retirement benefits on a reduced basis.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 20, the policy holder is obligated to submit to interviews and examinations by representatives or professionals of The Company's choice for determining disability status or fulfilling other policy terms. These assessments are at the company's expense and as reasonably required. Refusal without a valid reason may result in denial, suspension, or termination of benefits. The policy holder's additional proof of loss must be deemed satisfactory by the Company.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, written Proof of Loss must be submitted within 90 days following the commencement of the liability period for payment. Failure to provide proof within the stipulated time does not necessarily invalidate a claim if it was impracticable to comply or if proof is given as soon as possible but no later than one year afterward, unless you are legally incompetent. The insurance company may request Proof of Loss throughout your Disability; in such cases, the proof must be provided within 30 days following the request.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, benefit payments are issued when the policyholder is deemed disabled (row 2) and eligible for benefits (row 3). Payments are made at the end of each month the policyholder remains disabled (row 4), with optional advance payment based on estimated disability duration (row 6). Any due payments following claim termination will be issued upon receiving satisfactory Proof of Loss (row 9).
<EOS>
According to the Claims to be Paid section on Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf pages 20 (rows 2-11), all payments under this policy are made directly to you. In the event of your death, any unpaid benefits will be distributed to your estate. However, if a payment is owed to your estate, a minor, or an individual who is not legally competent, The Hartford may pay up to $1,000 to a relative who is entitled to it at their discretion. Any such payment fulfills the obligation for the amount paid.
<EOS>
As per Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, if a claim for benefits is either wholly or partially denied, the policyholder will receive written notification detailing the specific reasons behind the denial, referencing the relevant Policy provisions that support the decision. This notification also includes a description of any additional information required to perfect a claim and an explanation as to why it's necessary. Furthermore, the review procedure is explained in this notice.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, within the specified timeframes - 180 days for disability-related claims and 60 days for non-disability claims following a denied claim - you or your representative may request a review of any claim denial by submitting a written application. This appeal process includes the right to request copies of relevant documents, records, and information pertaining to your claim. Additionally, you can submit comments, documents, records, and other information related to your claim during this process. The insurance company will respond with a final decision in writing.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (pages 20-21, rows 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2) outlines your recourse in case of a dispute regarding disability benefits. If you disagree with the company's decision following their final review of your claim, you have the right to refer the matter to an arbitrator. To initiate arbitration, contact the main office of the American Arbitration Association in Washington, D.C. Proceedings will adhere to the procedures established for Employee Benefit Plan Claims by the American Arbitration Association. One neutral arbitrator from their approved panel will conduct the arbitration, with costs split equally between you and the company unless otherwise ordered by the arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision is final and binding, and it may be turned into a court judgment in any applicable jurisdiction.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, you should apply for Social Security disability benefits when your disability exceeds the minimum required duration. You must submit your application within 45 days from our request for such. If the Social Security Administration denies your eligibility for benefits, you are mandated to follow their reconsideration process and, if denied again, request a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Hearing and Appeals.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, the insurance company may reduce your disability benefits based on an estimate of Social Security disability benefits you or your family might receive. This reduction occurs when it is determined that you, your spouse, or children may be eligible for such benefits. The reduction can be avoided if you apply and pursue appeals as required under the Social Security provision, authorize the Social Security Administration to release information about awards, sign and return a reimbursement agreement, and provide proof of final denial from the Office of Hearing and Appeals when your application is denied.

If a later awarded Social Security disability benefit is lower than the estimate, a refund will be issued in a lump sum. Conversely, if the benefits are higher and overpayments occur on your monthly benefit, you must return a lump sum equal to all overpayments as per the Overpayment Recovery provision. Proof of awards or denials is essential for adjusting your monthly benefit.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on page [21], an overpayment occurs when the total benefits paid exceed the rightful amount under The Policy (rows 2-11), or when payments were made under another group policy instead (rows 6, 7). This can result from retroactive awards from specified sources, late reporting or failure to report Other Income Benefits or earned income, misstatements, fraud, errors, or any other inaccuracies (rows 2-5, 8-10). The policy defines Other Income Benefits and holds the recipient responsible for their accurate reporting.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, the insurer has the right to recover any overpayments made within 30 days from you or your estate, other organizations, insurance companies, or anyone to whom payment was made. Failure to reimburse in a timely manner allows the insurer to reduce or offset future benefits, refer unpaid balances to collection agencies, and pursue legal action in court. Additionally, overpayment recovery terms may be specified in the benefits eligibility reimbursement agreement you'll sign.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 22, rows 2-10, if you experience a disability due to a Third Party's act or omission and receive benefits under the policy for lost wages, failure to initiate legal action against the Third Party within a reasonable timeframe grants us subrogation rights. We have the option to pursue legal action on your behalf to recover any payments made in relation to the disability, should we choose to do so. This applies only when you are entitled to and paid benefits for lost wages due to a Third Party's actions.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, under the Reimbursement section (pages 22, rows 2-12), the policyholder grants the company the right to seek reimbursement for any disability benefits paid or due, in cases where a third party provides payment. This recovery can be achieved through legal judgments, arbitration awards, settlements, or other means. The policyholder is required to repay the company the lesser of: 1) the amount paid or owed by the company; or 2) the recovered amount from the third party, minus any reasonable legal fees incurred during recovery. This repayment must occur if the total received from the third party exceeds the benefits initially paid or due under the policy.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, section on page 22 row 2, "Third Party" refers to any individual or legal entity whose action or inaction contributes fully or partially to the policyholder suffering a Disability, for whom benefits are paid or payable under The Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, legal action against us can only be initiated within specific timeframes. The first limitation is that no legal action may commence sooner than sixty days following the submission of the Proof of Loss. Conversely, any claim must be filed no more than three years after the date the Proof of Loss was required according to the terms of the policy.

<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (pages 22 and 23, rows 2-6, 1, 1, 2, 3), misstatements about the insured may lead to adjustments in premiums and reassessment of coverage duration. Material facts misrepresented will be employed to decide if, and for how long, insurance should have been provided, post-three years from policy issuance throughout the insured's lifetime. Only written, signed statements can be used after this three-year period, with fraudulent misstatements being an exception.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 23 (rows 2-6, 1, 2), for an individual to be considered "Actively at Work," they must perform their regular occupational duties in the usual manner for their typical number of hours on a scheduled workday. If a day is not a scheduled workday, then the individual was Actively at Work only if they were already doing so on the preceding scheduled workday. This definition applies to the policyholder's wage or profit-earning activities.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, page 54, row 2, an 'Active Employee' is one who consistently works for the employer in the regular business, meeting at least the hours shown on the Insurance Schedule.

<EOS>
According to the Bonuses section in Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 23, rows 2-8, your monetary bonuses for this policy are calculated as the monthly average of rewards received from your employer during the 12 months preceding your disability if you were actively employed, or over the entire period you worked for that employer if it's shorter than 12 months. In case neither of these applies, the calculation includes any employer-given bonuses during your disability period or rewards gained from any work performed during this time.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, the commissions referred to are the average monthly monetary commissions earned from an employer during the 12 months preceding your disability onset if you were actively employed at that time, or throughout your entire employment period with that employer if it's shorter than 12 months. Alternatively, commissions could originate from any employer or work performed during your disability period.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, current monthly earnings refer to income you receive from employment, other work for pay or profit, and any additional sources while disabled.

However, if your earnings are 80% or more, an extension of the Elimibility Period for another 12 months may apply. This Disability can result from accidental injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse, or pregnancy. Loss of a professional or occupational license does not automatically mean you're disabled under this policy. The Disability must affect your ability to perform the duties of your occupation, and a suspended, revoked, restricted, or surrendered license alone does not qualify as Disability.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, on page 24 row 1, the term 'Employer' is defined as equivalent to the Policyholder. This means that the entity responsible for the policy is the same as the one employing individuals or entities under this insurance agreement.

1. Other Income Benefits can include:

3. If Other Income Benefits are received in a lump sum or settlement, proof of the amount attributed to loss of income and the period covered by the lump sum or settlement must be provided.

4. If the policyholder cannot or does not provide this information, the entire sum will be assumed as for loss of income, and the time period will be 60 months.

5. A retroactive allocation of any retroactive Other Income Benefit may result in an overpayment of the claim.

6. Any increase in Other Income Benefits that takes effect after the date benefits become payable under the policy will not be included as Other Income Benefits.

Commissions effective on the last day before disability and other fringe benefits or extra compensation are included. Overtime, on-call hours (unless regularly scheduled) are not considered. For hourly employees, it's the average number of hours worked monthly over the preceding 12 months prior to the last active work day before disability, multiplied by their hourly wage on that date. This figure includes contributions made through a salary reduction agreement for IRC Sections 401(k), 403(b) or 457 deferred compensation arrangements, executive non-qualified deferred compensation arrangements, or an IRC Section 125 plan for the same period.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, rehabilitation involves the insurance provider collaborating with you to develop a plan for returning to work. This may encompass various services deemed appropriate, such as vocational testing, training, alternative treatments like support groups, physical therapy, occupational therapy, or speech therapy. Additionally, workplace modifications when not already provided, job placement, transitional work, and similar services could be part of the rehabilitation program.

For Delaware residents, the definition of Spouse has been expanded to include civil union partners who fulfill policy requirements, either by legal documentation or where such proof is not prohibited by law. The Surviving Spouse definition in the Survivor Income Benefit has been amended to reflect this change as well.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, pages [34, 35], "Spouse" includes your domestic partner under two conditions: either you've executed a satisfactory domestic partner affidavit for the policy or registered as domestic partners with a government agency where applicable, providing proof of registration unless it is prohibited by law. Continuation as domestic partners necessitates ongoing adherence to these requirements. The definition of "Spouse" has been amended to include your domestic partner under similar conditions. For Wisconsin residents, the claim appeal time periods have been removed. In all other respects, the policy and certificates remain unchanged for all parties.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, a Change in Family Status encompasses several events: marriage or civil union, divorce or termination of a civil union, birth or adoption of a child, death of a spouse or partner, emancipation or death of a child, change in employment status of a spouse affecting group insurance, and alterations from full-time to part-time or vice versa.

However, it will remain subject to all policy terms and provisions. For Maine residents, an additional provision applies.
<EOS>
In accordance with the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, coverage may be reinstated after its termination for non-payment of premiums within 90 days if the policyholder or authorized representatives experienced cognitive impairment or functional incapacity at that time.

Claim appeal time periods are changed to 180 days if less than 180 days, and the Arbitration provision has been removed. For New Jersey residents, the Change in Family Status provision has been replaced with new terms.

To maintain domestic partner status, requirements stipulated by law or the affidavit must be met continuously. The Change in Family Status provision has been replaced with this definition.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, a Change in Family Status includes getting married or forming a domestic partnership (including executing an affidavit), divorcing or terminating a domestic partnership, having a child (by birth, adoption, or legal guardianship), the death of a spouse, child emancipation or death, loss of group insurance due to a spouse's unemployment, and changes in employment status from part-time to full-time or vice versa.

<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5419875 policy modification details key aspects:

As per Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, Vermont law mandates that health insurers provide coverage to parties in a civil union equivalent to what's offered to married individuals. This requirement is outlined on page 34, row 2 of the document. The law enforces this equivalence to promote fairness and inclusivity in health insurance coverage.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5419875 document amends the policy's definitions regarding marital relationships and family connections to include those established through civil unions according to Vermont law. Terms such as "spouse," "dependent," "children," "family," etc., now encompass those in civil unions. A dependent is defined as a spouse, civil union partner, or child (natural, stepchild, legally adopted, or minor/disabled dependents) born or brought into a marriage or civil union. This extends to the covered child definition which includes children born or brought into the same circumstances.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, Vermont law grants civil union parties the same benefits, protections, and responsibilities as married couples under state law, but federal laws may affect health insurance benefits. ERISA, a federal law governing employer/employee relationships, doesn't require private employers to enroll civil union partners in health benefit plans. Governmental employers (not federal) must provide health benefits to the dependents of civil union parties if they offer them to spouses. Federal laws also control COBRA continuation rights and Internal Revenue Code treatment of premiums. As a result, access to certain benefits under this policy may be limited for civil union partners and their families due to federal law. Washington residents should note that the Surviving Spouse definition in the Survivor Income Benefit has been amended. Expert advice is recommended to determine rights under this contract.

According to the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 43 rows [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], your life insurance and principal sum will experience reductions as you age. Specifically, a 65% reduction applies on the policy anniversary following age 65, and another 50% reduction at age 70. These reductions are based on the amount in force immediately prior to these respective anniversary dates. The reductions apply not only to your current coverage but also if you become covered under the policy or experience an increase in coverage after reaching age 65.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, eligibility for coverage occurs on the soonest date out of three possibilities: the Participating Employer's effective date, the day you join an Eligible Class, or completion of the Eligibility Waiting Period for Coverage as shown in the Schedule of Insurance (if applicable). In other words, your eligibility starts either with the commencement of your employment, joining the specified employee group, or after meeting the waiting period stipulated in the insurance schedule.
<EOS>
As per the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf enrollment section (page 43, rows 2-3), if you have Non-Contributory Coverage, your employer will automatically enroll you. Nevertheless, you are obligated to complete a beneficiary designation form to specify the recipient(s) of any potential benefits. It's essential to take care of this requirement promptly for seamless coverage.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, you'll need to provide Evidence of Insurability for any coverage exceeding the Basic Guaranteed Issue Amount or if you were eligible for previous coverage but did not enroll and now opt for coverage under the current policy. If your provided evidence is unsatisfactory, your life insurance amount will match the eligible amount without providing evidence, given enrollment within 31 days of eligibility. Any enrollment more than 31 days after eligibility results in no coverage under the policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, Evidence of Insurability is required and can consist of a completed application, medical examination, attending Physician's statement, or any additional information necessary. This evidence will be provided at the company's expense, except in cases of late enrollment. The company will then assess your insurability, informing you in writing of their decision regarding any Evidence of Insurability submission.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (page 44, rows 2-10), if you're set to be covered under the policy, for increased benefits, or a new benefit, and are not Actively at Work due to a physical or mental condition on the coverage start date, your coverage will commence only upon your return to Active Work. This deferred effective date applies when the reason for non-coverage is a health issue.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, the initial coverage under the policy commences and is not deferred if, on the day before the Participating Employer Effective Date, you were insured under a prior policy and actively at work or on an authorized family and medical leave. If this is the case but you are not actively working on the Participating Employer Effective Date and meet The Policy's eligibility requirements, your insurance amount will be the lesser of the life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment principal sum from the prior policy or shown in the Schedule of Insurance. This reduced amount, subject to any reductions in The Policy and without increase, continues for up to 12 months unless terminated early due to reasons outlined under The Termination provision. If coverage ends because you are actively working, you may be covered as an Active Employee under The Policy. Your insurance terminates earlier if the Prior Policy terminates or you cease to meet eligibility requirements under the Prior Policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 44 and 45, the effective date for changes in coverage depends on their nature: decreases become effective upon the change itself, while increases take effect on the latest of three scenarios - either the date of change, the date the Deferred Effective Date provision requirements are fulfilled, or when Evidence of Insurability is approved (if necessary).
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on page 45 (rows 2-1,2), if you wish to increase your life insurance coverage, you must provide evidence of insurability regardless of whether you're already enrolled for basic life insurance under the policy or not. If you've already been enrolled, this applies for any additional basic life insurance coverage, including the initial amount. Additionally, if the requested increase surpasses the Guaranteed Issue Amount, evidence is still required. Unsatisfactory evidence will not alter your current life insurance amount.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, it is stated that if your life insurance coverage increases due to an elevated income (based on a multiple of your earnings), you must provide evidence of insurability when your increased earnings result in coverage exceeding the Guaranteed Issue Amount. A rise in premiums will coincide with this enhanced coverage. Once approved, there is no further need for evidence of insurability if your insurance amount increases solely due to income growth. However, failure to provide suitable evidence or if submitted evidence is unsatisfactory may lead to a restricted increase (up to the eligible limit without providing evidence) and prevent any subsequent adjustments until approval is granted.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, your coverage will cease on the earliest of six conditions:

  1) The policy termination date.

  2) The date your employment ends or you no longer belong to a class eligible for insurance.

  3) Non-payment of premium when due.

  4) Your inactivity at work.

  5) Your employer's termination or ceasing to be a Participating Employer.

  6) Unless extended by the Continuation Provisions, any of these events will terminate your coverage.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (pages 45, 46) outlines continuation provisions for insurance coverage. Coverage can be continued beyond its termination date if the employer provides a plan applicable to all employees equally and not under more than one Continuation Provision. The amount of continued coverage will match the level in effect before termination, subject to any reductions in the policy, premium payments, time limits, and termination conditions (e.g., policy termination or employer ceasing to be a participating employer).

Coverage continuation during leaves of absence, military leave of absence, Family Military Leave of Absence, lay-off, status change, disability insurance, sickness or injury, Family Medical Leave, and sabbatical have specific durations and requirements. For instance, coverage may continue for up to 12 months due to sickness or injury or up to 8 weeks during a Family Medical Leave, subject to applicable laws. Sabbatical continuation requires pre-approval if longer than 30 days.

In summary, insurance coverage can be continued under various circumstances, but it is subject to specific terms and conditions outlined in this policy section of the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, pages 46 and 47, the Waiver of Premium provision enables you to maintain your Life Insurance coverage without payment if you become disabled and qualify for this benefit. The continued coverage will be:

1. Equal to the amount in force on the date you cease being an Active Employee.
2. Subject to any reductions as outlined by the policy.
3. Will not increase.
4. The qualification for Waiver of Premium is subject to the conditions set forth in the policy.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on page 47, row 2, this policy only covers Your Basic Life Insurance. No additional or optional coverages are applicable under this provision. The specifics of this coverage may be subject to other terms and conditions within the policy document.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 47, rows 2-10, 'Disabled' refers to a condition where you are unable to perform any work for which you are qualified due to injury or sickness, considering your education, training, or experience. Alternatively, being diagnosed with a life expectancy of 12 months or less qualifies as Disabled.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, page 47, rows 2-9, to qualify for the Waiver of Premium provision, you must: be under age 60 and covered under the policy when disabled; provide proof of being disabled for six consecutive months starting on the date you last actively worked; and submit this proof within one year of your last day as an active employee. To be eligible, you must have been actively working under the policy before applying for the waiver.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf outlines the conditions for waiver of premiums. Premium waiver begins after notification, but not before the first 6 months of disability. Proof of continued disability and occasional examinations are required within the initial 2 years, followed by an annual examination thereafter. Failure to provide proof or refuse examination may result in termination of premium waiver. However, returning to work for less than 5 days during the first 6 months doesn't interrupt the waiting period, provided the disability continues throughout the period. Returning to work for more than 5 days requires a new waiting period. Additionally, if your application for premium waiver is denied, you may be eligible for conversion of coverage under the Conversion Right.
<EOS>
In the event of death within a year after leaving active employment with Hartford Cert 5419875, and before qualifying for Waiver of Premium, the policy will pay out the existing life insurance amount, provided the deceased was continuously disabled for at least six months prior to death, and premiums had been consistently paid for coverage during this period.
<EOS>
According to the policy section in Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (pages 47, rows 2-9), the Waiver of Premium will continue as long as you remain disabled before attaining Normal Retirement Age if you are disabled prior to age 60. Once this waiver ends, there are two possible scenarios:

1) If you return to work in an Eligible Class as an Active Employee, you may again become eligible for coverage provided premiums are paid on time.

2) If you do not return to work in an Eligible Class, the coverage will terminate. Under these circumstances, you may exercise the Conversion Right if done within the specified time limits; however, the Amount of Life Insurance subject to conversion will be based on the terms and conditions of the Conversion Right.
<EOS>
In case of insurance policy termination or cessation of your employer as a Participating Employer in Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, you may have the option to convert the policy within the specified time limits (if not yet qualified for Waiver of Premium). If eligible and qualified, continued Waiver of Premium can be approved post-termination. However, once qualified, termination or cessation won't affect your coverage under this provision.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, upon your death during policy coverage, a Life Insurance Benefit will be paid following the submission of Proof of Loss, in adherence with the Proof of Loss provision. The benefit will be distributed in accordance with the general provisions of the policy. This payout is subject to the terms and conditions outlined within the policy document.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, under the Accelerated Benefit provision (rows 2-7 on page 48), if you're terminally ill, aged under 60, and have a policy with a minimum of $10,000 life insurance coverage, you can request an advance payment, ranging from a minimum of $3,000 to a maximum of 80% of your coverage (up to $500,000). However, the total advance payment cannot exceed 80% of your policy amount. This option is exercisable only once. For instance, if you have a policy worth $20,000, you can request any amount between $3,000 and $16,000 to be paid early instead of the remaining sum upon death. Upon proof of terminal illness, you'll also qualify as disabled for Waiver of Premium. Certain circumstances, such as legal claims by creditors or government benefit qualifications, may require you to adhere to all terms and conditions to receive an advance payment. If you have assigned your rights and interest regarding your life insurance, the insurer must obtain a release from the assignee before any benefits are payable.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf at pages 48 rows 2, 3, and 1 (and partially at row 2), the policy reserves the right to demand ongoing proof of a terminal illness diagnosis. This evidence must be provided by a physician. If such proof is not submitted or if you refuse a requested examination by a physician, the accelerated benefit will not be paid out.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, if you are no longer terminally ill, your coverage may continue or end based on specific conditions. If you return to an Eligible Class and pay the premium, coverage remains in force. If you do not return to an Eligible Class but remain disabled (subject to Waiver of Premium provision), coverage also continues. However, if neither condition is met, your coverage will terminate, and you may have a chance to exercise the Conversion Right, provided you act within the specified time limits. Notably, any Accelerated Benefit paid reduces the amount of coverage.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (page 49, rows 2-14) details the conversion right when Life Insurance coverage under the policy ends. You may convert terminated coverage to an individual policy without providing Evidence of Insurability, except for Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefits or any ineligible/uncovered amounts. To be eligible for conversion:

1. The policy must have been active for at least 5 years if it ends due to termination, coverage termination for an Eligible Class, or if your employer is no longer a Participating Employer.
2. The amount convertible is limited to $10,000 or the Life Insurance Benefit under the policy minus any group life insurance coverage eligible within 31 days of termination, should the policy end for reasons other than those mentioned above.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 49, rows 2, the term 'Insurer' encompasses us or another insurance company that agrees to issue policies in accordance with this Conversion Right. This provision allows policyholders to convert their current policy into a new one under specific conditions, such as upon the occurrence of certain events like death or maturity, or at specified times stated within the policy terms. The new policy issued by the Insurer will not exceed the original policy's cash value or net premiums paid, whichever is greater. This conversion privilege extends for a set period, usually until the policy's termination date.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, to convert your coverage: complete a Notice of Conversion Right form and have your employer sign it. The Insurer must receive this within 31 days after Life Insurance terminates or 15 days from the date your employer signs, whichever is later; however, requests are not accepted more than 91 days after termination. After verifying eligibility, the Insurer will send a Conversion Policy proposal requiring completion and return within the specified time along with premium payment. The issued policy will be effective from the 32nd day after coverage ends, replacing existing coverage for that amount under the policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 49 and 50, the Conversion Policy issued upon termination of this Life Insurance will be based on available forms at conversion time and premiums will correspond to the Insurer's rates for applicants of your age class. The policy will not include additional benefits or term insurance, nor offer the same coverage terms as the original policy. Conversion is inapplicable to any Amount of Life Insurance being continued under the Waiver of Premium provision or Continuation Provisions until such coverage ends.
<EOS>
In the event of death within 31 days after coverage under this policy terminates (as stated in Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf pages [50] rows [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1, 2]), The Hartford will pay the Amount of Life Insurance you would have been eligible for had conversion been applied, provided that proof of loss is submitted. If a Conversion Policy has already commenced, no life insurance benefit will be paid under this policy for the converted amount.
<EOS>
According to the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit section of Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (pages 50, rows 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2), if you suffer an injury within 365 days of an accident resulting in specific losses, the insurer will pay a portion or entire Principal Sum (as shown in the Schedule of Insurance) upon receiving Proof of Loss. The payment adheres to the General Provisions of the Policy. Only one person will receive a total sum for all losses stemming from the same accident. This Benefit is subject to the Policy's Proof of Loss provision, and no additional payments beyond the Principal Sum will be made for the same incident.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on page 50 rows [1-15], the policy outlines various benefit amounts for specific disabilities. The principal sum is payable in full for total loss of both hands, feet, sight in both eyes, or loss of speech and hearing in both ears. For a partial loss such as one hand and one foot, or sight in one eye, the principal sum is also paid out. Partial losses like movement of either upper or lower limbs (quadriplegia or paraplegia), triplegia, hemiplegia, or uniplegia pay a percentage of the principal sum, specifically 3/4, 1/2, 1/4, and 1/4, respectively. Additionally, specific parts like the thumb and index finger of either hand or a single ear will receive 1/4 of the principal sum.
<EOS>
According to the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf on pages 50 and 51, a Seat Belt and Air Bag Benefit is payable if an insured sustains an injury resulting in a loss covered under the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit. This benefit applies to the insured as either a passenger wearing a seatbelt or the licensed operator of a properly registered motor vehicle wearing a seatbelt, as verified on a police accident report. The Seat Belt and Air Bag Benefits are each less than the product of the Principal Sum multiplied by their respective percentages (Seat Belt Benefit Percentage or Air Bag Benefit Percentage) but not exceeding the Maximum Amount for this benefit. If seatbelt usage cannot be confirmed at the time of accident, a Minimum Benefit will apply under the Seat Belt Benefit. The benefits are payable after providing Proof of Loss in accordance with the policy's provisions and adhering to the general policies outlined in the contract. Additionally, an Air Bag Benefit is payable if the insured was positioned in a seat equipped with a factory-installed airbag and properly strapped in at the time of airbag inflation.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, an accident is defined for the sole purpose of this benefit as an unintentional collision of a Motor Vehicle, regardless of whether or not the policyholder was wearing a Seat Belt. This definition applies only within the context of the stated benefit, with no specific time restrictions mentioned in this section.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, an Air Bag refers to an inflatable supplemental passive restraint system installed by the Motor Vehicle manufacturer. This system inflates upon collision to protect individuals from injury and death, yet it is not considered a Seat Belt.

It is crucial to note that an Air Bag, as defined here, serves as a distinct safety feature.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, the term 'Seat Belt' refers to an unaltered belt, lap restraint, or lap and shoulder restraint installed by a Motor Vehicle manufacturer.

According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, life insurance and accidental death benefits will follow the designated beneficiary. If no beneficiary is named or survives the policyholder, The Hartford may choose to pay the executors or administrators of the estate, the surviving spouse, the surviving children in equal shares, or the surviving parents if there are no children. A maximum of $500 for burial expenses may also be paid to a person equitably entitled, and any payment releases The Hartford from further liability. If a beneficiary is a minor, The Hartford may pay their share until a legal guardian is appointed, providing up to $200 at the policyholder's death and monthly installments of not more than $200. Any payment to any person will release The Hartford from all further liability for the amount paid.

Furthermore, it outlines the review procedure and provides instructions on how to initiate this process.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (pages 53-54, rows 2-6, 1-2), the claimant or their representative has the right to appeal any denied claim for a full and fair review within specific timeframes.

According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, after two years from its effective date, the Life Insurance Benefit cannot be contested, except for non-payment of premiums. This incontestability provision does not apply to Accidental Death and Dismemberment benefits. Additionally, any statement regarding insurability made by the policyholder won't be used to contest their insurance if it's been active for two years or more, unless it's in writing, signed, and indicative of fraud. Such statements must be made after the insurance has been in force for two years.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, you have the right to assign your rights and interests under the policy, including the ability to make required contributions, convert the policy, and name or change a beneficiary.

<EOS>
According to the Workers' Compensation section on Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (page 54, row 2), it is clarified that the policy does not replace or affect any existing obligations for Workers' Compensation coverage.

<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, page 54 rows 2-6, if material facts about the policyholder are misstated, adjustments may be made to the premium and the true facts will be used to determine the appropriate coverage amount. This could potentially impact the validity of the insurance.

According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, Earnings for sole proprietors, partners, members of a partnership or shareholders in an S-Corporation are determined under federal income tax laws. For the period immediately prior to your last active work date, earnings consist of either: a) the annual average of "net earnings from self-employment" reported for one year, or b) the total number of months employed if less than a year. Additionally, Your regular annual rate of pay is based on your Form W-2 for the same period, or the total number of calendar months worked if less than a year.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, page 55, the term "Earnings" refers to an employee's regular annual salary excluding bonuses, commissions, and tips. Overtime or on-call pay is not included unless regularly scheduled. For hourly workers, Earnings are calculated as the average number of hours worked per year (excluding overtime or on-call hours unless scheduled) multiplied by their hourly wage effective just prior to their last active employment date. This wage calculation applies for the most recent 1-year period preceding that date.

According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, your Normal Retirement Age is defined by the Social Security Act and is determined by your birthdate.

To qualify, an employer must agree to these terms and fulfill their financial obligations, ensuring uninterrupted participation throughout the duration of the policy.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, Page 56, Row 2, the term "Prior Policy" refers to the group life insurance policy held by the Participating Employer on the day preceding the effective date of this new policy. The coverage under this new policy will consist only of that which is transferred from the Prior Policy to us. Essentially, this means that we are assuming responsibility for a portion of the coverage previously provided by the Participating Employer's existing insurance policy. This important detail pertains to the effective date and the scope of coverage under this newly established contract.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf (page 56, row 2), the term "Related" encompasses your spouse, any adult residing with you, siblings, parents, step-parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, as well as nieces, nephews, sons, daughters, or grandchildren in a legal relationship similar to those mentioned. This implies that individuals who are legally considered family members in the same way as nieces and nephews hold this designation.
<EOS>
In the Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, it is outlined that a spouse can be your legal partner or civil union partner if: a) you both have submitted a domestic partner affidavit acceptable by The Policy, or b) registered as domestic partners or civil union partners with a relevant government agency, unless law prohibits such proof. To be considered ongoing domestic partners or civil union partners, you must continue to fulfill the requirements of the affidavit or legal demands. For Wisconsin residents, the conversion right amount is $5,000 and claim payments are capped at $1,000 each (unless already at this figure). The rest of the Policy remains unchanged. This document is signed by Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company.
<EOS>
In accordance with Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, a dependent is defined as your spouse or child. A person in full-time military service cannot be considered a dependent unless they are later called to duty and the premium is paid. The age limit for continuation of dependent children with disabilities is increased to 21 if they are under that age. Additionally, the Period of Coverage now includes the provision: any disabled child who is unable to support themselves due to a physical or mental impairment can be covered beyond the normal age limit. This policy does not cover individuals residing outside the United States, its territories, and protectorates.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf details that coverage terminates upon entering active military service but can be reinstated within 31 days of returning to work and being rehired within 12 months, provided the request is made within said period. The reinstated coverage maintains previous amounts without waiting periods, evidence of insurability or pre-existing conditions limitations, while subjecting to the policy's terms.

The claims to be paid provision now includes an option for paying up to $500 from the Life Insurance Benefit for funeral and last illness expenses. Additionally, the Seatbelt and Air Bag Benefit is excluded if operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol or narcotics not administered by a physician.

Injury sustained while under the influence of narcotics, except those administered on a physician's advice, are now excluded from Accidental Death and Dismemberment Exclusions. For Massachusetts residents, the definition of Terminal Illness or Terminally Ill cannot exceed 24 months. Michigan residents no longer have access to the Policy Interpretation provision, while Minnesota residents maintain their military leave of absence terms.
<EOS>
In Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, under Provisions section on pages 58 rows 4 and 5, the "Lay Off" provision from the Continuation Provisions has been removed and replaced with a new one titled "Documented Military Leave of Absence." This amendment allows policyholders on military leave to maintain coverage without interruption. The updated provision includes specifics about the duration of leave, return-to-work requirements, and any applicable premium adjustments during this time. It's important to note that this provision applies only to documented military leave of absence, underscoring the significance of proper documentation. This amendment is a reflection of Hartford's commitment to support policyholders serving in the military.
<EOS>
This Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf section on pages [58, 59] outlines the Lay Off coverage. If voluntarily or involuntarily terminated or laid off, you can elect to continue your coverage by making monthly premium payments to the Employer. You must do this within 60 days from either the date your coverage would end or when you receive notice of your right to continue coverage. The premium charged may not exceed 102% of the premium paid for life insurance coverage for an active employee.

The Employer will inform you about your right to continue coverage, the monthly premium amount, and payment details. Upon request, they'll provide a written verification of the cost of coverage. Coverage continues until either you're covered under another group policy or the 18th month following termination or layoff.

If your coverage ends due to the Employer failing to notify you or pay premium after timely receipt, they will be liable for benefit payments as if you were still covered, according to Minnesota law. A laid-off status means a reduction in work hours that makes you ineligible for coverage. Termination excludes discharge for gross misconduct but includes retirement.

Important: the 7th paragraph of the Accelerated Benefit provision is deleted, as well as the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th paragraphs of the Conversion Right provision. The first sentence of the 5th paragraph of the Claims to be Paid provision is amended, allowing for benefits greater than $15,000 to be paid into a draft book account (checking account) owned by either you if living or your beneficiary in case of death. For Missouri residents, specific time periods stated in certain provisions may differ.
<EOS>
In the stipulations of Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, under the When Premiums are Waived provision, it is detailed that if Waiver of Premium is approved, it becomes effective from the onset of disability and gets retroactively waived once a 180-day waiting period has been completed. Furthermore, the Suicide provision has been revised, replacing its original form with new terms.
<EOS>
This information from Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf outlines suicide-related coverage conditions. If the policyholder or dependent commits suicide within a year of coverage purchase or increase, no Supplemental Life Insurance benefits will be paid. Premiums paid for this period will be refunded. In the event of suicide within one year from the policy effective date or during the group life insurance coverage under the Prior Policy, all premiums are returned.

For accidental death and dismemberment claims, suicide or attempted suicide is excluded, regardless of sanity. For Montana residents, the Conversion Right period extends to 3 years if initially greater than 3 years, with a minimum conversion amount of $10,000. The second paragraph in the Conversion Policy Provisions is deleted for all residents. If the stated claim payment amount is less than $500, it will be adjusted to $500; otherwise, it remains unchanged. An additional provision regarding claims payment is added.
<EOS>

For New Hampshire residents, certain provisions like Waiver of Premium and Disability Extension are deleted, while additions include extending conversion time if notice is given after the Policy ceases. The notice of Conversion Right will be sent within 15 days post-Policy cessation. Conversion requests past 91 days following Life Insurance termination will not be accepted unless no notice was given. Proof of Loss items #3 and the second paragraph's dollar amount are eliminated, while the Period of Coverage adjusts if Spouse Accidental Death and Dismemberment is included in the contract. If a claim amounts to less than $250, no payment will be made.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5419875.pdf, if you're divorced or legally separated, your former spouse can continue coverage under the policy for up to three years following the anniversary of the divorce or separation, unless earlier terminated by remarriage, specified dates in the final decree, failure to pay premiums, or your death.
