According to Lincoln Cert 4939978, partial disability is defined as follows: During the Elimination Period and Own Occupation Period, an insured employee is partially disabled if they are unable to perform one or more of the main duties of their regular occupation or are unable to perform such duties full-time and are engaged in Partial Disability Employment. After the Own Occupation Period, partial disability means that due to an injury or sickness, the insured employee is unable to perform one or more of the main duties of their regular occupation.

The Elimination Period begins either at the date the policy starts or at the date an approved leave of absence begins, if the Elimination Period begins while the insured employee is continuing coverage during a leave of absence. Full-time means the average number of hours the insured employee was regularly scheduled to work at their regular occupation during the month just prior to either the date the Elimination Period starts or the date an approved leave of absence begins.

Partial Disability Employment is employment that allows the insured employee to perform their main duties with reasonable accommodations, which may include modified hours, job restructuring, or reassignment to a vacant position. The definition of partial disability also includes self-employment, if the insured's earnings are less than 85% of their predisability income after 24 months of receiving partial disability benefits.

The maximum benefit amount payable under the policy is 66 2/3% of the predisability earnings, subject to a maximum monthly benefit of $10,000 and a lifetime maximum benefit of $2 million. The waiting period for benefits begins on the first day following the elimination period, and benefits are payable for up to 24 months or until the insured returns to work on a full-time basis, whichever comes first.

The policy provides for cost-of-living adjustments, which are calculated using the Consumer Price Index and are applied annually on the anniversary date of the policy. The policy also includes provisions for continued coverage if the insured returns to work part-time or on a modified schedule, as well as provisions for waiver of premiums during periods of disability.

The policy requires that claims be submitted within 60 days of the elimination period ending and that the claimant provide medical documentation supporting their partial disability status. The policy also includes a provision for independent medical examinations at the insurer's expense.

This information is drawn from Lincoln Cert 4939978.pdf, specifically pages 4, 7, 8, and 19. The Policy issued by the Company to the Policyholder is in effect. The Physician, who must be a legally qualified medical doctor or other duly licensed medical practitioner acting within the scope of his or her license, provides medically appropriate treatment for the Insured Employee's disabling condition. Regular Care of a Physician involves the Insured Employee personally visiting this Physician as often as medically required and receiving medically appropriate treatment. The Regular Occupation or Own Occupation is the occupation, trade, or profession in which the Insured Employee was employed with the Employer prior to Disability and was his or her primary source of earned income beforehand. This includes any work within the same occupation for pay or profit, whether with the Employer, another firm, or self-employed. The Regular Occupation encompasses the main duties of that occupation as performed in the national workforce, but by itself does not constitute Total Disability. Partial Disability is applicable if the Insured Employee's current earnings are at least 20% of Predisability Income, with the maximum earnings not to exceed the percentage specified in the Partial Disability Benefit section.
