This Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf document outlines an insurance policy with no eligibility waiting period for coverage. The cost of coverage and eligible classes are specified on pages 9, 34, and 66. Benefit amounts are also provided in these sections.

If a claimant becomes disabled, they face a 6-month waiting period before benefits can be claimed, unless they return to work for up to 5 days within the first 6 months, in which case the waiting period remains uninterrupted as long as the disability persists for the entire 6 months. If the claimant returns to work for more than 5 days, a new waiting period must be satisfied.

The policy does not require any waiting periods for coverage, evidence of insurability, or pre-existing conditions limitations. The terms and provisions of the policy apply to all policyholders. Additionally, if Waiver of Premium is approved, it will be retroactive to the date the disability began and premiums will be waived once the 180-day waiting period has been completed.

According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, the maximum duration of benefits payable is either 11 weeks if due to injury or sickness. Benefits will not continue beyond this limit, and any exclusions will apply to the new cause of disability. The payments will cease on the last day of the Maximum Duration of Benefits, or when your current weekly earnings surpass 80% of your pre-disability earnings if you're receiving benefits for occupation-related disability, or when no further benefits are payable under any policy provision limiting benefit duration. The benefits accrue from the first day after the elimination period and are paid monthly, but will not exceed the Maximum Duration of Benefits as detailed in the table. All other policy provisions regarding the Maximum Duration of Benefits also apply.

This information from Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf outlines the conditions for termination of coverage in a defined contribution plan, including a Participating Employer's agreement to contribute for Active Employees and certain types of retirement plans not funded solely by individual contributions (pages 11, 18, 19, 36, 49, 50, 77, 78, 86). The covered periods for required premium contributions are significant, as is the date of employment termination, cessation of full-time active employment in an eligible class, or a Participating Employer ceasing to participate. Excluded from retirement plans are profit sharing plans, thrift, savings, stock ownership plans, non-qualified deferred compensation plans, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), tax sheltered annuities (TSAs), Keogh Plans, 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans, or 457 deferred compensation arrangements.

In the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf document, it is detailed that disability benefits are provided under certain conditions. The Elimination Period lasts for 90 days, during which claimants must remain disabled and submit Proof of Loss to be entitled to benefits. Benefits accrue as of the first day after the Elimination Period and are paid monthly, but will not exceed the Maximum Duration of Benefits.

If a policyholder earns 20% or less of their Indexed Pre-disability Earnings after the Elimination Period, their Monthly Benefit is calculated by multiplying their Pre-disability Earnings by the Benefit Percentage. If they earn more than 20%, benefits will be determined for up to 12 consecutive months using a similar calculation and considering Other Income Benefits and Current Monthly Earnings.

If the policyholder's earnings are less than 80% of their Pre-disability Earnings during the Elimination Period or after, they may have an extended Elimination Period of up to 12 months. If their earnings exceed 80%, but they are unable to perform essential duties of their occupation, the Elimination Period will still be extended if their earnings remain above 80%.

Accidental bodily injuries sustained within 365 days after an accident resulting in specific losses may also trigger a monthly benefit payment for at least the minimum number of months indicated. Benefits may continue as long as the policyholder remains disabled, and any remaining payments will go to the estate if the policyholder dies before the Minimum Number of Monthly Benefit Payments have been made.

According to Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf, your monthly benefit is determined by comparing the result of the calculation with the maximum benefit and deducting any other income benefits from the lesser amount. Importantly, your current monthly earnings will not reduce your monthly benefit, but if the combined total exceeds 100% of your pre-disability earnings, a reduction in your monthly benefit will be applied to compensate for the excess. The maximum benefit and pre-disability earnings are crucial factors in calculating your monthly benefit under this policy.

In the Hartford Cert 5387491.pdf document, it is detailed that your monthly disability benefit will be determined based on pre-disability earnings and current monthly earnings, with the latter not reducing your benefit but being capped at 100% of your pre-disability earnings. If your total earnings plus other income benefits surpass this threshold, your benefit will be reduced accordingly while ensuring it never falls below the minimum benefit. Overpayments may lead to recovery in accordance with the overpayment provision.

Family care credits have a maximum limit of $2,500 per year and are proportionally deducted for less than monthly periods. These deductions must be documented by receipts from the caregiver. Your benefit will not be payable if your current earnings after deducting family care credits exceed 80% of your pre-disability earnings.

Should your current earnings reach or surpass 80% of your pre-disability earnings, your elimination period for disability benefits will be extended by a total of 12 months from the original date of disability, or until your earnings drop below this threshold.
