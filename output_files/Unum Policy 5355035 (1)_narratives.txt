<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, under Non-Participating provisions (row 1, page 2), the policyholder's premium contributions are fixed and do not vary based on the policy's investment performance. The policy's expenses, however, may fluctuate due to administrative costs and other fees. This plan does not offer any potential for policyholders to participate in, or profit from, its investment activities. In case of death benefits, a 10% commission will be charged from the policy value. Additionally, should the policyholder surrender the policy before the age of 65, a surrender charge may apply, with a gradual decrease until the age of 70. After that, no surrender charges are levied.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, the policyholder listed is Welsh Mountain Medical and Dental Center. The center is responsible for providing timely information regarding changes in employment status or ownership. Any such updates should be communicated within 60 days of the change occurring. Failure to do so may result in benefits being affected or terminated. The policy also states that the policyholder must provide required documentation, including W-2 forms and annual statements, by January 31st following the end of each calendar year. Additionally, the policyholder is subject to a policy fee of 0.5% annually on the benefit amount, with the first payment due upon activation of coverage.

According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, the policy number associated is 650532. The policy mandates that if a claimant becomes disabled and has not returned to work within 90 days following the date of disability onset, the company will commence benefits effective from the 91st day. The benefit amount payable equals 60% of the monthly earnings, subject to the maximum and minimum limits set by Unum. The company reserves the right to conduct periodic reviews of the claimant's disability status every two years or following significant changes in the claimant's health condition, employment, or income. Benefits will cease if the claimant returns to work or reaches the policy's maximum duration limit of 24 months.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, the policy effective date is November 1, 2017. This policy outlines that coverage begins on this date and continues as specified in the policy terms. The policy duration is contingent upon continued premium payments, compliance with all policy provisions, and the absence of any material misrepresentations during the application process.

In accordance with Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, a revised definition of B@G-LTD-1 was established on November 1, 2017. This term refers to the Long-Term Disability benefit amount payable per month during the disability period, subject to any applicable maximums and minimums set forth in the policy. The total percentage of pre-disability earnings this benefit represents is not specified, however, it is designed to provide a level of income replacement in the event of a long-term disability.
<EOS>
Under Unum's Long Term Disability Plan outlined in Policy 5355035 (1), financial protection is offered by paying a portion of your income during disability. The payout amount is determined by pre-disability earnings. In specific instances, you may receive disability payments concurrently with work. Key aspects to note include the following:

* Eligibility requires 6 months of full-time employment prior to the claim date
* Disability definition is based on inability to perform the material and substantial duties of your own occupation for the first 24 months, then any gainful occupation thereafter
* Total disability payments are up to 60% of your monthly earnings at the time of disability, subject to maximum limits
* After 24 consecutive months, the payment may be reduced if you return to work in a suitable capacity with adjusted benefits for partial disability
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, effective date for policy coverage begins on November 1, 2017. This short-term disability insurance provides benefits based on the employee's earnings, with a maximum benefit of $6,000 per month. The elimination period is 14 days, following which, benefits are payable if the employee is unable to work due to a non-occupational illness or injury. The policy duration extends up to two years, and there's a possibility for extension under certain conditions. Partial disability coverage is also included in this policy, with benefits prorated according to the percentage of disability sustained by the employee.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, all full-time employees in active employment within the United States with the employer are eligible for benefits. This eligibility extends only to those individuals employed on a permanent basis, working more than 20 hours per week. No part-time or contractual employees are included in this scope. Coverage begins from the employee's hire date and remains active as long as they continue their full-time employment status.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, for an employee's coverage eligibility under this plan, they must work at least 30 hours per week. This minimum hours requirement applies consistently throughout the policy period. If there are any changes in employment status or working hours, it is crucial to notify the company promptly to ensure continued eligibility for benefits.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf on page 4, the waiting period for employees in an eligible group before November 1, 2017, or those joining after this date, is 90 days of continuous active employment. This means that a new employee must be actively employed for 90 consecutive days to become eligible for the policy benefits. The waiting period applies to all individuals within the designated group.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, if your employment ends and you are rehired within a year, any previous work while in an eligible group will be recognized towards satisfying the waiting period. All other policy provisions apply. This means that your eligibility for benefits under the specified terms won't change based on this rehire scenario. The waiting period refers to the duration before benefits can be claimed following a break in employment.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, your employer is responsible for funding the insurance coverage. The policy remains active as long as you continue employment with the company, and terminates upon separation of employment. If eligible, you may have the option to convert this group policy into an individual plan post-employment, but the terms, costs, and conditions will differ. It's essential to review the conversion details provided in the policy documents for specific requirements and deadlines.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, upon completion of the 90-day elimination period, benefits will commence. This means that after three months from the policy activation, you will start receiving payments. The elimination period is a prerequisite for benefit eligibility.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf on page 25, rows [2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], your partial disability benefits will cease if you're capable of working part-time in your regular occupation but choose not to. If you work and earn more than 80% of your indexed monthly earnings, payments will end on the date your earnings reach that threshold. The policy terminates after the maximum payment period ends, unless you become eligible for Unum's Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program.

Your benefits may also stop if you fail to submit proof of continuing disability, if you reside outside the United States or Canada for 6 months or more during any 12 consecutive months of benefits, or upon your death.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, under certain circumstances, payments may cease. This includes:

- The first 24 months if you can work part-time in your regular occupation but do not;
- After 24 months if you can work part-time in any gainful occupation but do not;
- At the end of the maximum payment period;
- Upon recovery under the plan's terms, unless eligible for Unum's Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program;
- If proof of continuing disability is not submitted;
- After 12 months if residing outside the United States or Canada for a total of 6 months or more during any consecutive 12-month period of benefits;
- When disability earnings exceed the plan's allowable amount;
- Upon death.
<EOS>
This information from Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf on pages [4, 5] outlines the Maximum Period of Payment based on Age at Disability. For individuals under Social Security Normal Retirement Age, payments last until that age: less than 62 years old receives 60 months, while ages 62-68 have decreasing monthly periods ranging from 48 to 18 months. Those aged 69 or older receive 12 months. The Social Security Normal Retirement Age varies by year of birth, from 65 for those born before 1937 to 67 for those born after 1960. Notably, no premium payments are required during active payment periods under this plan.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, a Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance benefit is offered. This benefit amounts to 10% of your gross disability payment, with a maximum of $1,000 per month. The benefit continues while you participate in the program and are unable to find employment even after your disability ends. Post-disability payments will be made for three months following the end date of your disability. This provision applies only if it is determined that you are no longer disabled during this period.
<EOS>
During your participation in Unum's Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program, you are eligible for monthly payments to cover certain dependent care expenses.

According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, the maximum monthly benefit payable, including all plan benefits, is limited to either 100% or 110% of your earnings. This restriction applies if you are not enrolled in their Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program, or if you are, respectively. This policy applies to all benefits provided under the plan.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, there's a feature called Continuity of Coverage. This provision ensures that if an employee's employment terminates due to retirement, disability, or death, they can maintain their group long-term disability insurance coverage without interruption. The continuation period is for up to six months after the qualifying event, and premiums are payable by the insured on a monthly basis. Additionally, if the insured's new employer also offers Unum group long-term disability insurance, they may be eligible for coordination of benefits to avoid double coverage. The maximum benefit amount during this continuation period remains the same as that under their active employment.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, in regards to pre-existing conditions, a waiting period of 3 months applies before coverage is granted for such conditions. Specifically, benefits will only be paid if the condition has been symptom-free for 12 consecutive months prior to the effective date of the policy. This provision applies to any disability claims resulting from a pre-existing condition during the initial 24-month benefit period.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1), section on Survivor Benefit, it is stated that in case of the insured's death, a benefit will be paid to the designated beneficiary. The payable amount equals the total monthly basic LTD base rate multiplied by a survivor percentage specified at the time of policy purchase. This survivor percentage cannot exceed 50%. The maximum period for receiving this payment is until the end of the insured's Original Term or age 65, whichever comes first. Notably, any changes to the beneficiary designation must be made in writing and approved by Unum. If no beneficiary has been designated at the time of death, the policy will be paid according to the policy's provisions for intestate succession. This information can be found on page 6, row 1.

<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1), it is crucial to inform the company about your claim within 30 days following the onset of your disability. Additionally, you must provide evidence of your claim no later than one year after your disability's commencement, unless failure to do so is due to a lack of legal capacity. Under no circumstances can proof be submitted beyond the legal proceeding time limit as stated in the policy. Returning to work necessitates immediate notification. Importantly, failing to provide evidence or returning to work does not extend these deadlines if they are dictated by your lack of legal capacity or state law exceptions.
<EOS>
To file a claim under Unum Policy 5355035 (1), both you and your employer are required to complete the claim form. Once filled out, submit this directly to your attending physician for them to fill in their section and send it immediately to Unum. Obtain the form from your employer or request it directly from Unum. If you do not receive the form within 15 days of your request, proceed to submit proof of claim without waiting for the form.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, payments will be made directly to you. These payments are intended for the Disability Income Benefit period, which lasts until the policy's termination date or your return to work, whichever occurs first. The initial benefit amount is based on a percentage of your pre-disability earnings, with the exact percentage dependent on your occupation and any disability reductions that may apply. Payments are subject to applicable taxes, and any changes in your status or circumstances could affect your entitlement to benefits.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, the policyholder is responsible for repaying any overpayments resulting from fraud, errors in claim processing, disability earnings, or deductible sources of income. Repayment methods may include reducing or withholding future payments, including the minimum monthly payment. Unum will not recover more money than what was paid to the policyholder. Any unpaid premium due for coverage under this policy can be recovered by offsetting against amounts otherwise payable to the policyholder, or through other legally permitted means. The critical date mentioned is 11/1/2017.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, the initial premium for each Long Term Disability plan is determined by the rates shown in the Rate Information Amendment(s). The premium remains constant unless amended by the company. The policy provides benefits equal to 60% of your pre-disability monthly earnings, subject to a maximum and minimum limit as specified in the policy. The initial rate period lasts for two years, after which it may be subject to reevaluation based on your occupation and any changes therein. If you return to work before the end of the two-year initial rate period, you may still be eligible for partial benefits under certain conditions. This coverage continues until you reach the policy's maximum benefit period or resume full-time employment.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, during periods when an insured is receiving Long Term Disability benefits, the policy waives premium payments. This means that the insured does not have to make any premium contributions while they are receiving disability payments under this plan. This waiver of premium continues for as long as the insured remains eligible for LTD benefits.
<EOS>
This Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf section on Initial Rate Guarantee and Rate Changes, located at page 10 row 1, outlines the importance of consulting any Rate Information Amendments. The policy guarantees an initial rate for a specified period before potential adjustments based on factors such as increased or decreased mortality and morbidity rates, changes in expenses, or investment experience. These modifications may lead to rate increases or decreases not exceeding a set percentage, typically detailed in the Rate Information Amendment(s). Any rate changes take effect following specified effective dates.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, premium due dates for this policy are established based on the Premium Due Dates shown in the Rate Information Amendment(s). The policyholder must submit all premium payments to Unum by their respective deadlines. These payments should be made in US dollars.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, premium adjustments, whether an increase or decrease, effective within a policy month are applied on the subsequent premium due date. These changes are not pro-rated daily. If payments are made other than monthly, the adjustment for increases and decreases will result in a monthly pro-rated correction on the next premium due date. Unum makes premium adjustments only for the current and prior policy years, except in cases of fraud where adjustments are made across all policy years.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, the policyholder is required to consistently provide information on their eligible employees, changes in coverage amounts, and those whose coverage terminates. Additionally, occupational data and any other necessary claim management details must be shared. Unum may also request additional information deemed reasonable. Policyholder records related to this policy can be reviewed by Unum at any convenient time, should they deem it relevant.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, a clerical error or omission by Unum will not prevent an employee from receiving coverage, impact the amount of coverage, nor cause coverage to begin or continue when it would not otherwise be effective on rows [1, 1, 2, 3, 4] of page 11.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, the policy or a plan under this policy can be cancelled by either Unum or the Policyholder. Unum may cancel or modify for reasons such as insufficient employee participation (less than 75% for premium-paying employees, and less than 100% for Policyholder-paid plans), failure to provide required information, non-performance of obligations, low employee count (fewer than 10), late or incorrect premium payments, failure to report added or deleted employees, significant changes in the eligible group due to corporate transactions, or failure to pay premium portions within a 31-day grace period.
<EOS>
This Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf section highlights the terms related to policy modifications and cancellations on page 11 rows [2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]. If Unum cancels or modifies the policy for reasons other than non-payment, a written notice is provided at least 31 days prior. The Policyholder may cancel unacceptable modifications. If premiums are not paid within the grace period, automatic cancellation or modification occurs at its end, with the Policyholder responsible for coverage during this time. Premiums for each active plan must be paid in full. Cancellation by either party terminates coverage at 12:00 midnight on the final day of coverage, except for a payable claim. Upon agreement, cancellation can be expedited. If cancelled, it does not impact a payable claim.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf on page [12], during a family and medical leave of absence, employee coverage continues if premium payments persist and the policyholder approves the leave in writing. This continuation adheres to the policyholder's Human Resource policy or federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) requirements, lasting until the end of either the FMLA period or applicable state law leave period. If the HR policy doesn't offer coverage during leaves, the employee's coverage will resume upon returning to active employment. The policy doesn't require a new waiting period, pre-existing conditions exclusion, or evidence of insurability.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliated companies under consideration must be explicitly identified by name and location (city and state). These entities are subject to the same terms and conditions as the primary insurance policy. They must also adhere to all regulatory requirements and maintain separate books and records, with annual audits conducted by independent auditors. Any ownership changes within these entities must be reported promptly to Unum. The policy requires that Unum maintains a minimum of 51% controlling interest in any subsidiary or affiliate, while the remaining interest may be owned by other parties. The document further stipulates that Unum's Board of Directors has the authority to determine and approve any additional divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates as necessary.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035, starting November 1, 2017 (revision), if a claimant's disability results from mental or nervous conditions, they must have undergone Inpatient Psychiatric Hospitalization for at least 48 hours within the initial 6-month period of disability. If such hospitalization does not occur during this timeframe, the claimant may still be eligible for benefits if they have completed a minimum of 10 outpatient visits with a psychiatrist or psychologist over the same 6-month span. The policy stipulates that these conditions apply only to long-term disability claims and not short-term ones. Furthermore, the policy reserves the right to request additional medical information during the claim review process.

This Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf section on page [13], rows [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1], welcomes you as a client, providing your certificate of coverage. The document is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction and ERISA, with adjustments according to group policy effective dates and ending times at the Policyholder's address. Unum Life Insurance Company of America located at 2211 Congress Street Portland, Maine 04122, issues your coverage, which may be modified under the terms and provisions of the policy. In case of queries regarding any terms or provisions, consult Unum's claims paying office for assistance in understanding benefits. The policy document supersedes your certificate of coverage if there are discrepancies. Your coverage can be terminated or altered entirely or partially as per the policy terms.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, the Certificate of Coverage is a statement prepared by Unum containing possible coverage details, payee information, and limitations, exclusions, and requirements within a plan. It outlines the benefits you might be entitled to receive, to whom Unum will make payments, and the conditions under which these payments can be made, including applicable restrictions and obligations. This document may include attachments for further clarification.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, eligibility for coverage commences under one of two conditions: firstly, on the policy's effective date; secondly, a day after completing the waiting period, whichever occurs later. Eligibility is contingent upon employment within an eligible group.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, your coverage begins based on various conditions. If your employer fully funds the policy, you're covered at 12:01 a.m. upon eligibility. For shared or self-funded policies, coverage starts either at your eligibility date if you apply by then, within 31 days after eligibility if you apply late, or when Unum approves your application (if evidence of insurability is required, which applies when you're a late applicant or reapplying after voluntarily cancelling coverage). Evidence of insurability forms can be acquired from your employer.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, coverage begins when an insured individual returns to active employment after being absent due to injury, sickness, temporary layoff, or leave of absence. This means that the coverage start date is dependent on the return to work and not the initial absence.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, during a temporary layoff, if you continue premium payments, your coverage will extend through the month immediately succeeding the one in which your leave begins. This benefit is applicable only for temporary layoffs, with no specifications on duration. Keep in mind that failure to maintain premium payments may result in loss of coverage.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, during a leave of absence, if premiums are paid, coverage continues through the month that directly follows the one in which your leave commences. This provision is detailed on page 15, rows 1, 2, and 3.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, any changes to your coverage are immediate if you're employed actively or on a covered leave. For instance, increased or additional coverage begins upon returning from injury- or sickness-related absence. Conversely, decreased coverage takes effect immediately but won't impact ongoing benefits. If unsure, refer to page 15, rows [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] of the policy document.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1), your insurance coverage terminates on the earliest occasion of policy/plan cancellation, ceasing to belong to an eligible group, discontinuation of the covered eligible group, the last day of required contributions payment period, or your departure from active employment, unless otherwise specified under the covered layoff or leave of absence provision. Coverage for a payable claim will be provided as long as you remain insured under the policy or plan.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, you may initiate legal action related to your claim 60 days after proof of claim submission and within 3 years from the later of: when initial claim evidence was required; claim denial; or benefit termination. Federal law exceptions may apply.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, any statements made in a signed application for coverage are considered representations, not warranties. If these statements are found to be incomplete or untrue at the time they are made, Unum can either reduce or deny a claim, or cancel the coverage from the original effective date. The policy uses only statements made in a signed application for this purpose. If an employer provides incorrect information about you, Unum will use these facts to decide your coverage amount and adjust premiums accordingly.
<EOS>
This policy from Unum 5355035 (1).pdf states that insurance fraud detection, investigation, and prosecution are prioritized to prevent additional costs for you and your employer. Knowingly submitting materially false information or concealing facts on an insurance application or claim is considered a fraudulent act, punishable by criminal and civil penalties. This fraudulent behavior constitutes a crime under the policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf on pages 16, rows 1 & 2, the policy does not replace or supersede the necessity for coverage by workers' compensation or state disability insurance. The policy operates independently of these programs. In essence, it's crucial to fulfill obligations under both this policy and any relevant workers' compensation or state disability insurance regulations.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1.11/1/2017 REV), your employer serves as either its own representative or yours, never acting as an agent for Unum. Under all circumstances, they will not be considered as agents of Unum regarding this policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, if your indexed monthly earnings decrease by 20% or more due to the same sickness or injury, and you receive payments for 24 months, you will be considered disabled. This is determined when it's established that due to the same illness or injury, you are unable to perform the duties of any gainful occupation.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1), a claimant must receive regular medical care to be deemed disabled. The loss of a professional or occupational license or certification alone does not establish disability.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf on page [24], if you qualify for benefits under items 1, 2, and 3 in the deductible sources of income section but have not yet received them or are appealing a denied claim, your Long Term Disability payment may be reduced. However, if you apply for these benefits and exhaust all necessary appeals at Unum, sign their payment option form, promising to repay any overpayment caused by an award, your payment will not be reduced.

When we receive proof of the awarded amount or completion of all necessary appeals (as deemed by Unum), your payment will be adjusted accordingly, and if an overpayment has occurred, a lump sum refund will be made to you. Any received lump sum from deductible sources will be prorated monthly over a specified or reasonable time period.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, if you are disabled while working, any days you're disabled will contribute towards satisfying your elimination period. This means that the duration of your disability can shorten the time needed before policy benefits become available. The policy does not specify a minimum number of work hours or earnings to qualify for this provision. However, it is essential to note that other requirements may apply regarding the nature and extent of your disabling condition.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, you will receive payments upon claim approval if you meet the elimination period and are deemed disabled. Payments are issued monthly for any period where Unum is responsible. The elimination period typically lasts a specific timeframe determined during application.

According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1), your disability payment will be calculated based on the following process. Your pre-disability monthly earnings are defined as your average monthly earnings during the highest consecutive 60 months before your disability start date, up to a maximum of $72,000 annually. The benefit amount is then determined by multiplying this figure by either 50% (for Own Occupation coverage) or 60% (for Any Occupation coverage), capped at the policy maximum for your specific plan. This calculation results in a monthly payment that will be paid to you during your period of disability, up until the end date specified in the policy. The policy duration varies based on the type of coverage and can last up to age 65 or 67. Additionally, there may be reductions if you receive other income during your disability, such as workers' compensation benefits or Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI).
<EOS>
In Unum Policy 5355035 (1), it is established that your gross disability payment under section 3 is determined by comparing two amounts: the answer from Item 1 and the maximum monthly benefit. Specifically, the lower of these two figures serves as your monthly disability payment. The exact numbers can be found on page 18, row 5 of the policy document. This comparison ensures that your payment does not exceed the maximum specified limit.
<EOS>
In Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, it is detailed on page 18 that your monthly disability payment (Item 4) may be adjusted based on any earnings from disability. If you are disabled for less than a month after the elimination period, you will receive 1/30 of your monthly payment and additional benefits for each day of disability. This reduction applies to your entire daily payment.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1.11/1/2017 REV), the total monthly benefit you receive from this plan will not surpass 100% of your earnings, except if you're enrolled in their Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program. In this case, your monthly benefit can reach up to 110% of your earnings. This policy limitation applies across all benefits under the plan.
<EOS>
In Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, "Monthly Earnings" are calculated from the income box on your W-2 form for the year preceding disability, or your average income during your employment if no W-2 was provided prior to disability. This figure represents gross income before tax deductions but excludes contributions to deferred compensation plans, Section 125 plans, or flexible spending accounts, as well as earnings from car, housing, or moving allowances, employer contributions to deferred compensation plans, and non-employer sources. It's important to note that this definition is found on pages [19] rows [1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
<EOS>
In the event of disability during a covered layoff or leave of absence, as per Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, your monthly earnings from your employer immediately prior to your absence commencement will be utilized for benefit calculations. This policy applies only during the covered period, with benefits capped at 60% of those earnings. The specific duration of this coverage depends on factors such as your employment agreement and any applicable collective bargaining agreements.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, if your disability is due to the same sickness or injury, your monthly earnings from disability must be less than 20% of your indexed earnings. If they are equal to or more than 20%, Unum will determine your payment by ensuring that during the initial 12 months, while you work, your combined disability and disability earnings do not surpass 100% of your indexed monthly earnings. In the first year, your payment will remain unreduced as long as this combined percentage is maintained. This policy pertains to rows [4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3] on page [20].
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, if the value calculated in Item 1 is equal to or less than 100% of your indexed monthly earnings, your payment will not be reduced further. Conversely, if it exceeds 100%, Unum will deduct the surplus from your monthly payment. After 12 months of payments while working, you will receive compensation corresponding to the percentage of income lost due to disability.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, your disability earnings are to be subtracted from your indexed monthly earnings. As outlined on page 20, row 1 of the LTD-BEN-4 (revised as of 11/1/2017), if you become disabled, your benefit amount will be calculated by deducting any disability earnings from your indexed monthly earnings to determine your net monthly earnings. The resulting difference is then multiplied by the specified percentage to arrive at your monthly benefit payment. This policy does not specify the exact percentage used for this calculation.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, to determine your percentage of lost earnings, your monthly benefits will be calculated by dividing the amount by your indexed monthly earnings. This percentage is crucial as it will determine the extent of financial support you receive during disability. The indexed monthly earnings are typically based on your salary history prior to the onset of disability. This calculation is vital in determining the length and amount of benefits you may be eligible for.
<EOS>
This Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf outlines the monthly disability payment amount. For the initial 24 months of payments, if your disability earnings surpass 80% of your indexed monthly earnings, the policy terminates. Beyond this period, if your disability earnings exceed the gross disability payment, your claim will also end. Post elimination period, for less than a month's disability, you receive 1/30th of your payment per day. Financial records, such as income tax returns, may be required to substantiate your income as proof of disability earnings (LTD-BEN-5, 11/1/2017 REV).
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1), deductible sources of income are subtracted from your gross disability payment. These include: any workers' compensation benefits, state temporary disability or unemployment benefits, and any other disability benefit paid under an insurance policy or plan. The amount to be deducted is based on the lesser of 20% of the total amount of such income received or the amount by which your Unum payment exceeds $300 per month. Any difference between the amount withheld and the actual amount of your deductible income will be returned within six months after the end of the policy year. This applies to payments during the elimination period and the monthly benefit periods.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, any disability benefits you receive may be reduced if your income derives from a workers' compensation law, an occupational disease law, or any other legislation with similar intent. This reduction is based on the gross weekly wage received under these laws, not including any benefits for illness or injury. The percentage of reduction depends on the type and timing of the benefits, but it may range up to 100%. This policy applies from the start of your disability until you reach age 65.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf on page 21, rows 2-4, your disability income is not subject to benefits from state compulsory benefit acts or laws, group plans sponsored by your employer, other group insurance plans, or governmental retirement systems. This exclusion applies to any disability retirement payments you may receive.

This Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf section outlines the disability payments you, your spouse, and children might receive. If you become disabled, payments could stem from several sources: the United States Social Security Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the Quebec Pension Plan, or any similar plan/act. As of November 1, 2017 (LTD-BEN-6), these payments can potentially be combined with the policy benefits. The percentage and exact amount depend on your individual situation, as detailed in the policy.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf on page 22, rows 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, and 4, your retirement benefits may be reduced if you or your children receive payments under certain retirement plans. This includes the United States Social Security Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the Quebec Pension Plan, or any similar plan or act. The reduction percentage varies based on the specific plan, with a maximum reduction of up to 100% for benefits received under the US Social Security Act. It is essential to note that these reductions will apply if you are concurrently receiving retirement payments from these sources while also receiving benefits under this policy.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, retirement payments are excluded from any governmental system where you're employed. These payments do not include those made after age 62 or the normal retirement age in your Employer's plan, if they are based on post-tax contributions. Unum views these post-tax contribution-related payments as distributed over your lifetime. Rolled-over or transferred amounts to eligible retirement plans are also excluded. As per Section 402 of the Internal Revenue Code, an eligible retirement plan includes any amendments that affect its definition.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, disability payments under an employer's retirement plan are defined. These payments are given due to disability and do not reduce the retirement benefit that would have been paid otherwise. Retirement payments stem from employer contributions to the retirement plan. Disability benefits reducing the retirement benefit are also considered as retirement benefits. Unum considers both your and your employer's contributions to the retirement plan as distributed concurrently throughout your lifetime, excluding amounts rolled over or transferred to any eligible retirement plan as defined in Section 402 of the Internal Revenue Code. The payments will commence when you reach the later of age 62 or the normal retirement age defined in the employer's retirement plan.

The benefit period is for a total of 78 weeks or until you return to work, whichever occurs first. Additionally, the definition of disability under this policy requires that your injury or illness prevents you from performing the essential functions of any job for which you are or may become qualified by training, education, or experience within 5 years before the date of your disability. This benefit is subject to taxation as ordinary income.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, if you receive disability income payments from a third party following subtracting attorney's fees, the policy requires that the excess amount be assigned to Unum. This assignment will commence on the date of receipt and continues for the duration specified in the assignment agreement. The percentage of the assigned payment varies based on the type of disability: 100% for own occupation (OO) benefits and 67% for any occupation (AO) benefits. If there is a dispute regarding the amount or timing of the payment, Unum may withhold payment to you until the matter is resolved.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1), disability income payments will be adjusted based on the Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law.

These conditions could include instances where the disability:

1. Lasts more than 24 months and is expected to last at least another 12 months.
2. Results in death before the end of the benefit period.
3. Is caused by a qualifying offsite accident (if applicable).

According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf on pages 27 and 28, if a policyholder experiences a recurrent disability within 6 months following the end of their prior claim, Unum will not require another elimination period provided they were continuously insured during that interval. The recurrent disability will adhere to the same terms as the previous one, considered an extension. Disabilities occurring after 6 months from the end of the prior claim are treated as new claims, subject to all policy provisions including a fresh elimination period. Payments under any other group long-term disability plan preclude eligibility for payments under the Unum plan (effective 11/1/2017 REV).

If you have been diagnosed with a terminal illness or condition and your life expectancy is less than 12 months while receiving monthly payments under the plan due to a disability lasting at least 180 days, Unum will pay a lump sum equal to 3 months of your gross disability payment. This benefit can be claimed voluntarily in writing, with your physician certifying your terminal illness and reduced life expectancy. Once paid, this benefit is non-renewable and will preclude any subsequent 3 month survivor benefit upon death. If you have no eligible survivors or an estate that does not exist, payment will go unrecovered. Overpayments on the claim will be addressed first before the payment of this benefit.

You must have been actively employed and insured under the plan on its effective date, and additionally, you must have been insured by the prior policy at the time of change.

To receive payment, you must meet either requirement 1 or 2: satisfy the pre-existing condition provision as defined in the Unum plan or in the prior carrier's plan if benefits would have been paid under the remaining policy. Failing to meet either requirement will result in no payments from Unum.

If you meet requirement 1, your payments will be determined based on the Unum plan provisions. If you only satisfy requirement 2, your claim will be administered according to the Unum plan provisions. Your payment will be the lesser of the monthly benefit that would have been payable under the prior policy or the monthly payment under the Unum plan.

Your benefits will end on either the end of the maximum benefit period under the plan or the date your benefits would have ended under the prior plan had it remained in force.

The calculation takes these factors into account: if you receive other income or disability benefits, the policy will reduce your monthly payment by that amount, not exceeding 85% of your pre-disability earnings. This adjustment is made continuously, ensuring that you receive the appropriate benefit based on your earned and disability income. These deductions apply throughout the duration of your disability, unless otherwise specified in your policy.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, 'HOSPITAL OR INSTITUTION' refers to an accredited facility licensed to provide care, specifically for the treatment of the condition causing your disability. This care should be in accordance with standard medical practices and must be necessary for your recovery or to stabilize your condition. The duration of hospital or institutional stay may be subject to review by Unum upon reaching a maximum limit, which varies case-to-case but is typically 24 months. If your condition improves during this period, Unum reserves the right to adjust benefits accordingly.
<EOS>
This Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf section describes the Indexed Monthly Earnings. These earnings are adjusted annually by the lesser of 10% or the current annual increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U), published by the U.S. Department of Labor. This adjustment may cause these earnings to either rise or remain constant, but they will never decrease. Unum reserves the right to employ an alternative comparable measurement if the Department of Labor alters or discontinues publishing the CPI-U. The indexing mechanism is significant in determining both the percentage of lost earnings during disability and gainful occupation status.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1), page 35, row 2, a covered injury is defined as a bodily harm that arises directly from an accident and not caused by any other means. For disability benefits to be granted, the disability must commence while the policyholder is insured under the plan.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 5355035 (1), the term "LAW, PLAN OR ACT" encompasses both the original legislations and subsequent amendments thereof.

According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, a temporary layoff or leave of absence denotes a pre-agreed time away from active employment. This does not include regular vacation periods or any disability leave. The policy does not classify such absences as temporary layoffs or leaves of absence.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, material and substantial duties are those necessary for your regular occupation performance and cannot be reasonably omitted or modified. However, if you work or can work an average of 40 hours per week beyond the usual requirement, Unum considers you able to fulfill that obligation. This policy pertains to duties that are critical for your primary job, with exceptions made for those working over 40 hours weekly.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, the Maximum Capacity refers to the maximum extent of work you can perform in your regular occupation that is reasonably accessible. This capacity assessment considers your restrictions and limitations. The policy defines work as your regular occupation, which is the job for which you are substantially trained by education, experience, or both. This occupation must be one for which you are reasonably suited by age, temperament, and prior work experience. The Maximum Capacity will be determined based on a combination of your residual functional capacity (RFC), vocational analysis, and other relevant factors.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, during the initial 24 months of disability, your maximum capacity is defined as the highest level of work in your regular occupation that is reasonably available. After this period, the maximum capacity becomes the greatest extent of work you can do in any occupation for which you are qualified by education, training, or experience and is reasonably available. This is applicable from rows 1 to 3 on page 36.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, the Maximum Period of Payment refers to the longest duration Unum will provide benefits for one disability episode. The exact period depends on the claimant's occupation and age at the time of disability onset. For instance, if a claimant is a sedentary job performer aged 65 or above, the maximum period is 24 months. However, for occupations that require lighter exertion and are performed by individuals under 65 years old, the maximum period can extend to 5 years. This limitation applies to each period of disability, meaning if a claimant recovers and later becomes disabled again, a new Maximum Period of Payment would apply.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, mental illness is defined as any psychiatric or psychological condition listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM), published by the American Psychiatric Association.

If the DSM is discontinued or replaced, the relevant disorders will be those classified in the manual used by the American Psychiatric Association at the start of the disability claim.
<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1), the Monthly Benefit refers to the total insured benefit amount for an employee, subject to the policy's maximum. This benefit is determined based on the employee's earnings and eligibility under the plan. For instance, if a participant qualifies for a 60% monthly benefit, it implies they receive 60% of their insurable earnings up to the policy's specified maximum limit each month. It is essential to note that this benefit may be subject to adjustments due to changes in employment status or other relevant factors as outlined within the policy.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, "MONTHLY EARNINGS" refers to the gross monthly income you receive from your employer as defined in the plan.

<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 5355035 (1), your monthly payment is defined as your remaining disability payment after any deductible sources of income have been subtracted. This deduction applies to your gross disability payment, specifically detailed on page 36, row 2.

According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, on page 36, row 3, the term "Part-Time Basis" refers to the flexibility to work between 20% and 80% of your indexed monthly earnings. This means that if you qualify for benefits under this policy, you may receive payments based on a reduced percentage of your usual income. The specific amount you will receive will depend on the actual percentage of your regular earnings that you are able to work while still being considered part-time.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, a policyholder's employment status on a Part-Time Basis refers to the ability to work and earn at least 20% of their indexed monthly earnings. This provision is significant because it may affect the calculation of disability benefits in case of an incident that prevents the policyholder from working full time.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, on page 36 row 1, a 'PHYSICIAN' is defined as an individual who performs tasks within the scope of their medical license.

<EOS>
Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, Recurrent Disability refers to a condition that worsens from your existing disability for which Unum made a previous payment. This recurrence must stem from the same underlying cause(s), resulting in a disability lasting more than 26 weeks. Such a disability triggers continued benefit payments according to the policy terms, subject to the usual evidence requirements and other conditions as specified elsewhere in the policy document.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf on page 37, Regular Care is defined as you personally visiting a physician with the appropriate specialty or experience for your disabling condition(s), as frequently as medically required based on generally accepted medical standards. This care must conform to these same medical standards and be the most appropriate treatment available for effectively managing and treating your disabling condition(s).
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf on pages 37, rows 2 to 4, "Regular Occupation" refers to the job you consistently carry out when your disability starts. The assessment of your occupation will be based on its typical performance within the national economy, rather than how it is done for a specific employer or at a particular location. This means Unum considers your role's standard requirements and duties across industries nationwide, not just those defined by your current workplace.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, a Retirement Plan is defined as either a defined contribution plan or a defined benefit plan.

Only non-work related payments are taken into account for determining your benefits.
<EOS>
According to Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf on page 38, rows 2-5, self-reported symptoms refer to condition manifestations not substantiated by common medical tests, procedures, or examinations.

Under Unum Policy 5355035 (1).pdf, a sickness is defined as an illness or disease. For disability benefits to be activated, the onset of the disability must occur while you are covered under the plan.

If approved for benefits, you will receive a monthly benefit payment equal to 60% of your monthly earnings up to the maximum benefit amount specified in the policy. The benefit period is generally two years, but may extend to age 65 if you cannot perform any occupation suitable to your education, training, or experience. Exclusions and limitations apply; consult the full policy for details.

In Pennsylvania, insurance companies offering life, annuity, and health policies are part of the Pennsylvania Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association (PLHIGA). Established to protect policyholders in financial insolvency cases, PLHIGA will cover claims within limits if a member insurer can't meet its obligations. The Association will collect funds from other member insurance companies for this purpose. However, the coverage offered through the Association is not a replacement for careful company selection and it does not influence purchase decisions. It's essential to choose well-managed and financially stable companies. By law, insurance agents are prohibited from using PLHIGA to induce policy purchases.
