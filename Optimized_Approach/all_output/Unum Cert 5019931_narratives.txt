According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, the group policy's effective dates run from 12:01 a.m. to 12:00 midnight at the Policyholder's address. The Employer's Original Plan Effective Date is December 1, 2015, or the day following the completion of your waiting period. Claims can neither be reduced nor denied, nor can coverage be canceled before this original effective date, with decisions based on statements made in a signed application. Pre-existing conditions must be met for claim payments. This involves showing no sickness, injury, or use of prescribed drugs or medicines in the three months prior to your coverage's effective date. Disability benefits apply only if the disability starts within the first 12 months after the effective date, and you must be actively employed and insured under the plan on its effective date, with insurance continuity from the prior policy at the time of change to receive payments.

This information originates from the Unum Certificate of Coverage document found on pages [5-8]. The critical details and requirements include:

* The Employee means a person actively working in the United States for the Employer. Evidence of Insurability refers to a statement of your medical history that Unum uses to determine if you're approved for coverage. This will be at their expense.

* A Governmental Retirementsystem is part of any federal, state, county, municipal or association retirement system providing for the payment of retirement and/or disability benefits". If your claim is denied or ignored in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or federal court.

* If the Plan fiduciaries misuse its money, or if you are discriminated against for asserting rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a federal court. The decision made by the court will decide who should pay costs and legal fees.

* If you have any questions about your Plan, you should contact the Plan Administrator. For questions about this statement, your rights under ERISA, or assistance in obtaining documents from the Plan Administrator, contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210.

According to the Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, a minimum hours requirement of 30 hours per week is necessary for employee eligibility under this policy. This means that employees must consistently work at least 30 hours weekly in order to meet the criteria and potentially receive coverage under this insurance plan.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 5019931.pdf document, the waiting period for insurance eligibility varies based on employment start date. For employees who were in an eligible group before December 1, 2015, the waiting period is 30 days following continuous active employment; for those starting after this date, it remains the same. Rehiring within 12 months of previous employment resets the eligibility period. Any prior work with your employer will be considered towards the waiting period to determine eligibility dates, which may coincide with or follow the initial month of active employment, and coverage begins thereafter. The waiting period represents the time an individual must be in active employment within an eligible group before becoming insured under the plan.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, the Elimination Period is 90 days for this policy. Disability benefits begin after this period ends, and your disability must be continuous throughout the elimination period. If your disability stops for less than 30 days during this timeframe, Unum will consider it as a single continuous disability. The days you are not disabled do not count toward the elimination period. Working while disabled does not affect the completion of the elimination period, with those disabled days counting towards it instead.

Payments begin upon claim approval if the elimination period is met and the individual remains disabled. Monthly payments will be sent for any eligible periods, with a 1/30 payment for each day of disability if you are disabled for less than one month after the elimination period.

For recurrent disabilities, Unum will treat them as part of the prior claim if they occur within six months from the prior claim end date. If any subsequent disabilities arise after this timeframe, they will be considered a new claim subject to all policy provisions, including the Elimination Period.

If you become entitled to payments under another group long term disability plan, you will not receive benefits from the Unum plan. The Elimination Period refers to a continuous period of disability that must be satisfied before receiving benefits from Unum.
<EOS>
In accordance with the Unum Cert 5019931.pdf document, your monthly disability payment is calculated based on your indexed monthly earnings before the onset of disability. The document outlines several crucial dates and requirements:

- Payments will cease upon the occurrence of specific events such as the end of the maximum period of payment (usually 24 months), the date you are no longer disabled, failure to submit proof of continuing disability, or if you reside outside the United States or Canada for more than half of any consecutive 12-month period while receiving benefits.
- Payments will be reduced if your disability earnings exceed 80% of your indexed monthly earnings, and they will completely stop once your earnings exceed 100%.
- During the elimination period (usually 7 days), no payments are made. After this period, if you are disabled for less than a month, you will receive 1/30 of your payment for each day of disability.
- Your monthly payment may be adjusted based on any disability earnings you receive from your employer, but salary continuation or accumulated sick leave are not considered disability earnings. Only compensation for work not performed after the disability begins is counted as such.
- You will be required to submit appropriate financial records, including income tax returns, to substantiate your income during the proof of disability earnings process.
- Payments are part of an established plan maintained by your Employer for the benefit of all employees covered under the Policy.

This information from Unum Cert 5019931.pdf outlines the terms of a disability insurance policy. The monthly earnings replacement benefit is set at 60% with a maximum limit of $10,000 per month. An additional 10% of gross disability payment has a maximum benefit of $1,000 per month. For dependent care expenses, there's a monthly maximum of $1,000. The cumulative maximum benefit period for mental illness and self-reported symptoms-based disabilities is 24 months, after which no further benefits will be paid, unless the policy ends or had it remained active under the prior plan. An extra disability benefit equivalent to 10% of gross disability payment, with a maximum of $1,000 per month, is provided, exempt from provisions that might increase or reduce the benefit amount. A 3-month monthly payment will be made following the onset of disability. The total benefit amount under this plan is subject to the Monthly Benefit limit.

This information from Unum Cert 5019931.pdf details the Dependent Care Expense Benefit available during Unum's Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program. Eligible participants may receive up to $350 per month, per dependent, with a maximum combined benefit of $1,000 per month for all expenses. These benefits are for dependent care expenses incurred when caring for children under 15 or those aged 15 and older, or family members requiring personal care assistance. To qualify, you must provide proof that you're incurring these expenses. Benefits end when you stop incurring dependent care expenses, leave the program, or as otherwise specified in the plan. The benefits commence upon starting the Unum program.

This Unum Cert 5019931.pdf document outlines the Continuity of Coverage provision for pre-existing conditions. If your employer switches insurance carriers to Unum, you may maintain coverage without a break, provided you have been covered for at least 3 months before. The Minimum Benefit Pre-Existing condition ensures that any such condition will be covered after the waiting period.

In case you are not actively employed when your employer transitions to Unum, you may still qualify for this Continuity of Coverage. The Work Life Assistance Program is applicable in these circumstances, offering guidance on how to secure coverage if you lose your job or change employers. The document also mentions a Survivor Benefit, though specific details about it are not elaborated upon in the provided pages.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 5019931.pdf document, a Minimum Benefit Pre-Existing condition is outlined under the Work Life Assistance Program (WHAT IF). The minimum benefit is subject to a 3/12 provision, meaning that only 3 months' worth of benefits will be paid if the employee has been continuously insured for less than 12 months prior to the disability. In instances where subtracting deductible sources of income yields a zero benefit, the minimum benefit will still apply (Minimum Benefit). It is important to note that this provision does not guarantee a specific amount but provides a minimum level of coverage.
<EOS>
In accordance with the Unum Cert 5019931.pdf document available on pages [6, 22], should death or terminal illness occur under the Survivor Benefit Work Life Assistance Program, your eligible survivor will receive a lump sum benefit equal to 3 months of your gross disability payment. However, any overpayment on your claim will be deducted first. If diagnosed terminally ill, you may receive this benefit prior to death. It's essential to note that if you opt for the pre-death payout, no additional 3 month survivor benefit will be provided upon your passing. This document outlines the benefits offered in such tragic circumstances, using technical terms while maintaining a natural sentence flow.

According to the Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, located on pages 6 and 26, a Work Life Assistance Program is included in your policy. This program offers help for personal or professional issues, such as locating daycare or senior transportation, researching colleges, and managing workplace stress. It provides support for daily life problems as well as during crises. This service is accessible via a 24/7 toll-free number (1-800) or online through a website. The program can be accessed by your employer as well. Information regarding this program can be obtained from your plan administrator.

According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, coverage is provided for claims that occur while the policy or plan is active. The policy termination, group eligibility cessation, and last day of contribution are determined by various events such as cancellation dates, changes in eligible groups, or active employment status except under specified layoff or leave provisions. Average gross monthly income includes total earnings before taxes, excluding deductions for deferred compensation plans, Section 125 plans, flexible spending accounts, car allowances, housing or moving allowances, Employer contributions to qualified deferred compensation plans, and income from sources other than the Employer. Retirement payments are based on Employer's retirement plan contributions, including disability benefits that reduce retirement benefits, and are considered distributed throughout one's lifetime. Retirement payments do not include amounts rolled over or transferred to eligible retirement plans as defined under Section 402 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Plan is funded by insurance from Unum Life Insurance Company of America, policy number 931543 012, and contributions are made as stated in the Certificate of Coverage. The Plan is a defined contribution or defined benefit plan that does not include any governmental retirement system.

According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages [20], the mental illness limitation does not apply to dementia if it stems from a stroke, trauma, viral infection, Alzheimer's disease, or conditions uncustomarily treated by mental health providers using psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or similar methods. Exceptions include conditions not explicitly listed in this policy.
<EOS>
This information from Unum Cert 5019931.pdf highlights key exclusions and a pre-existing condition provision. Notably, the policy does not cover disabilities resulting from intentionally self-inflicted injuries, active participation in riots, loss of professional or occupational license, commission of crimes for which you have been convicted, war (declared or undeclared), or incarceration.

A pre-existing condition is defined as any health issue for which medical treatment, consultation, care, services, diagnostic measures, or prescribed drugs or medicines were sought within the 3 months prior to your effective date of coverage, and if this condition leads to disability within the first 12 months after said effective date.

If you had a pre-existing condition when your employer switches insurance carriers to Unum, and you meet certain criteria, payments may be sent. Specifically, you must have been in active employment and insured under the plan on its effective date, as well as insured by the prior policy at the time of change. To receive a payment, you must satisfy the pre-existing condition provision either under the Unum plan or the prior carrier's plan if benefits would have been paid had that policy remained in force. If neither criterion is met, Unum will not make any payments.

In cases where only one of these conditions is satisfied, Unum will handle your claim according to its provisions if you meet the pre-existing condition provision under the Unum plan, or it will administer your claim based on the Unum plan if you satisfy the criterion for continuity of coverage from the prior carrier's policy.

Lastly, a pre-existing condition is referred to as any health issue for which medical intervention was sought during the specified period, as detailed in the plan.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, if your employer changes insurance carriers to Unum and you are not actively employed, your payment will be limited to the amount that would have been paid by the prior carrier. Any remaining amount will be deducted by Unum. If you suffer a disability due to a pre-existing condition during this transition, Unum may send a payment. This is contingent on either 1) the Unum plan or 2) the prior carrier's plan, as long as benefits would have been paid under the remaining policy. However, if neither criterion is met, Unum will not issue any payments. If you meet the first condition, your payments will be determined according to the Unum plan provisions. If only the second criterion is satisfied, your claim will be administered according to the Unum plan.

According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on page 26, a worksite modification might be required for you to perform your regular occupation's material and substantial duties with your employer. A designated professional from Unum will aid in identifying an agreed-upon modification that could enable you to continue or return to work. This agreement must be in writing, signed by you, your employer, and Unum. Upon signing, Unum will reimburse your employer for the cost of this modification.
