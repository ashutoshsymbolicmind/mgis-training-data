An insured employee must have a regular care provider for managing disabling conditions, be it due to an accident or pre-existing condition. The monthly benefit is subject to the maximum specified in the plan, with indexed monthly earnings increasing or remaining stable based on changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U). The CPI-U published by the U.S. Department of Labor serves as the benchmark for calculating these adjustments.

   The policy covers a recurrent disability if it worsens due to the same cause(s) as a prior long-term disability claim. To qualify as disabled, an individual must be unable to perform their regular duties or any part-time basis job that they are qualified for based on their restrictions and limitations. A full-time employee is considered able to perform their job if they can work 40 hours per week or have the capacity to do so.

   The plan defines a physician as a licensed medical practitioner, psychologist with a doctoral degree, or a legally qualified medical provider according to the governing jurisdiction's regulations. Unum does not recognize family members as physicians for claims processing.

   Notably, a pre-existing condition is one for which an individual received medical treatment, consultation, care, or services during a specified time period or had symptoms that would have prompted an ordinarily prudent person to consult a healthcare provider for the condition(s) within that same period of time.

Your elimination period, usually 90 days, must be met before payments commence, assuming you're disabled. Once approved, monthly payments will be sent if Unum is liable, continuing for each period of disability thereafter.

During the first 12 months, your payment won't be reduced while working, provided the combined disability earnings and gross disability payment don't exceed 100% of your indexed monthly earnings. After this period, payments adjust based on the percentage of income of time following the premium due date during which premium payment may be made.

The document also details recurrent disability benefits, allowing for continuation of prior claims if they occur within 6 months from the end of the previous claim and specific insurance coverage conditions are met. Any subsequent disability claims occurring after 6 months will be treated as new claims subject to all policy provisions, including a new elimination period.

Proof of your claim is required for approval, and Unum may request appropriate financial records to substantiate your income. If your disability earnings are less than 20% of your indexed monthly earnings, you'll receive the full payment. For disability earnings between 20% through 80%, the payment will be adjusted based on the calculation provided in the policy.

Lastly, gross disability payment refers to the benefit amount before any deductible sources of income or disability earnings are considered under the Policy.

According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, the maximum monthly disability benefit is the least of three options: $5,000; the benefit percentage (40%) multiplied by the pre-disability earnings on which premium has been paid; or the benefit percentage (40%) multiplied by the pre-disability earnings. If you remain disabled after the elimination period and earn 20% or less of your indexed pre-disability earnings, we will calculate your monthly disability benefit as follows: multiply your pre-disability earnings by the benefit percentage (40%), compare this result with the maximum benefit, deduct any other income benefits, and the remaining amount is your monthly benefit.

If you earn more than 20% of your indexed pre-disability earnings, we will calculate your disability benefit for up to 12 consecutive months by multiplying your pre-disability earnings by the benefit percentage (40%), comparing this result with the maximum benefit, and using the lesser amount as your monthly benefit.

The day care benefit provides an annual amount equal to the lesser of: the product of your principal sum and the Day Care Benefit Percentage; or the maximum amount for this benefit. Upon your death, if there is no surviving spouse, we will pay the minimum amount for this benefit in accordance with the Claims to be Paid provision.

The rehabilitation benefit provides an amount equal to the least of: actual expense incurred for a rehabilitative program; the product of your principal sum and the Rehabilitation Benefit Percentage; or the maximum amount for this benefit. The Spouse Education Benefit is the least of: expense incurred for occupational training; the product of your principal sum and the Spouse Education Benefit Percentage; or the maximum amount for this benefit. If a principal sum is payable because of your death and there is no surviving spouse, we will pay the minimum amount for this benefit in accordance with the Claims to be Paid provision.

In the Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf policy, disability benefits are provided when one becomes disabled while insured and remains so beyond an elimination period. However, the maximum duration of benefits is limited for certain conditions such as mental illness, alcoholism under treatment, or non-medical use of specific substances. Benefit payments cease on the earliest of specified conditions, including the date you are no longer disabled, failure to provide proof of loss, refusal to submit to an examination, death, or reaching the maximum duration limit based on a table in the policy.

A Progressive Illness benefit is also included if diagnosed after coverage under this policy, subject to providing satisfactory proof from your physician. If you are eligible for this benefit and meet these conditions, payments will continue until one of the earlier termination criteria is met or the maximum duration limit is reached. The exact end date for benefit payments depends on various factors such as current monthly earnings, participation in seeking and applying for suitable alternate work, and the policy's maximum duration table.
<EOS>
According to Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, your long-term disability coverage under this policy will terminate on the earliest of seven specified dates (pages 11, 24, 25, 26, 62, 64, 72). These include the policy termination date, when it no longer insures your class, unpaid premiums or late premium payments, cessation of employment, ceasing to be a full-time active employee in an eligible class, or your employer ceasing to be a participating employer. The coverage also excludes certain other income benefits such as Social Security Act early retirement benefits not received, group credit or mortgage disability insurance benefits, and military retirement benefits, among others (pages 24, 25).

The cost of the long-term disability insurance is primarily paid by your employer, who may allocate part of this cost to you. You might also pay the entire premium based on the employer's decision. The insurance company determines the cost according to the rate structure reflected in the Policy of Incorporation, and any amounts paid by employees can be used to pay benefits or expenses under the plan (pages 62, 64).

Additionally, basic life and accidental death and dismemberment coverage offered within the same ERISA plan may have premiums partly or fully paid by your employer. Employees electing supplemental coverage will be required to contribute specified amounts (page 72). Any contributions made by employees can also be used to pay benefits or expenses under this plan.

In accordance with Hartford Cert 5361113.pdf, your Disability benefits are calculated based on your Pre-disability Earnings and a Benefit Percentage. If you remain disabled beyond the Elimination Period and earn 20% or less of these Earnings, your Monthly Benefit will be determined by multiplying your Pre-disability Earnings with the Benefit Percentage. The resulting amount is compared to the Maximum Benefit; from this comparison, deduct Other Income Benefits to get your monthly benefit.

However, if you earn more than 20% of your Pre-disability Earnings, your Monthly Benefit will be calculated for up to 12 consecutive months by multiplying the Pre-disability Earnings with the Benefit Percentage. The resulting amount is again compared with the Maximum Benefit. To calculate this benefit, subtract your Current Monthly Earnings from your Pre-disability Earnings; the remaining sum after comparing it to the Maximum Benefit payable under the policy is your Monthly Benefit.

There's also a Return to Work Incentive provision that allows you to receive these benefits for up to 12 months if your earnings fall between 20% and 80% of your Pre-disability Earnings during this period. Lastly, the Infectious and Contagious Disease Benefit can be paid for an undefined duration but specific details on this matter are not provided in the document excerpt.

According to Lincoln Cert 4939978, partial disability is defined as follows: During the Elimination Period and Own Occupation Period, an insured employee is partially disabled if they are unable to perform one or more of the main duties of their regular occupation or are unable to perform such duties full-time and are engaged in Partial Disability Employment. After the Own Occupation Period, partial disability means that due to an injury or sickness, the insured employee is unable to perform one or more of the main duties of their regular occupation.

The Elimination Period begins either at the date the policy starts or at the date an approved leave of absence begins, if the Elimination Period begins while the insured employee is continuing coverage during a leave of absence. Full-time means the average number of hours the insured employee was regularly scheduled to work at their regular occupation during the month just prior to either the date the Elimination Period starts or the date an approved leave of absence begins.

Partial Disability Employment is employment that allows the insured employee to perform their main duties with reasonable accommodations, which may include modified hours, job restructuring, or reassignment to a vacant position. The definition of partial disability also includes self-employment, if the insured's earnings are less than 85% of their predisability income after 24 months of receiving partial disability benefits.

The maximum benefit amount payable under the policy is 66 2/3% of the predisability earnings, subject to a maximum monthly benefit of $10,000 and a lifetime maximum benefit of $2 million. The waiting period for benefits begins on the first day following the elimination period, and benefits are payable for up to 24 months or until the insured returns to work on a full-time basis, whichever comes first.

The policy provides for cost-of-living adjustments, which are calculated using the Consumer Price Index and are applied annually on the anniversary date of the policy. The policy also includes provisions for continued coverage if the insured returns to work part-time or on a modified schedule, as well as provisions for waiver of premiums during periods of disability.

The policy requires that claims be submitted within 60 days of the elimination period ending and that the claimant provide medical documentation supporting their partial disability status. The policy also includes a provision for independent medical examinations at the insurer's expense.

According to the document Lincoln Cert 4939979, partial disability or part-time incapacity is defined as follows: During the Elimination Period and Own Occupation Period, it refers to an injury or sickness that prevents the insured employee from performing one or more main duties of their regular occupation, or prevents them from doing such duties full-time, while they are engaged in Partial Disability Employment. After the Own Occupation Period, it means an injury or sickness that hinders the employee from performing one or more essential functions of their regular occupation, regardless of whether they perform these duties on a part-time basis or not.

The document also outlines specific definitions for full-time and Partially Disabled work. Full-time is defined as the average number of hours an insured employee was regularly scheduled to work at their regular occupation during the month prior to either: 1) the start date of the Elimination Period, or 2) the commencement of an approved leave of absence, if the Elimination Period starts while the employee is continuing coverage during a leave.

The document mentions several criteria that dictate when partial disability benefits can cease. These include:
- The insured employee earning more than 99% of their predisability income before partial disability benefits have been paid for 24 months for the same period of disability, or 85% after 24 months.
- The insured employee being able to work full-time in their regular occupation, regardless of whether they are earning the same wage as prior to their disability.
- The insured employee being found fit to return to any gainful occupation for which they are reasonably suited by education, training, or experience.

The document provides information on various benefits and requirements related to partial disability, including extended period of disability benefits and vocational rehabilitation services, among others. The exact extent of these benefits may depend on the specific circumstances of each individual case, as outlined in the documentation provided.
<EOS>
Under this policy, as outlined in Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, there is a provision for Vocational Rehabilitation Benefits (VRB). This benefit can be accessed when an Insured Employee is disabled and receiving policy benefits, provided they meet eligibility criteria. The VRB includes vocational evaluation, counseling, training, job placement, job modification, special equipment, and other necessary services to help the employee return to work.

Eligibility for this benefit is determined by the Company if the Insured Employee:
  1. Has a disability that prevents performance of their regular occupation, lacks skills/training/experience for any other gainful occupation after the Own Occupation Period, and has the physical and mental abilities needed to complete a vocational rehabilitation program.
  2. Is reasonably expected to return to work post-program completion given their degree of motivation and the labor force demand for workers in the proposed occupation.
  3. The cost of the proposed services is less than the Company's expected claim liability.

The amount of any VRB payable will not exceed the Company's expected claims liability, with payments made to service providers at the Company's discretion. Proposals for vocational rehabilitation can come from either the Company, the Insured Employee, or their Physician. During the rehabilitation period, the Policy's definition of "Disability" is waived, but it remains crucial in other aspects.

This sequence appears to be an unordered list of numbers. To find a pattern, let's first sort the list: [9, 11, 16, 19, 20, 25, 26, 39].

The smallest difference between consecutive numbers in this sorted sequence is |16 - 11| = 5. However, there are no pairs of consecutive numbers that differ by exactly 5 or any smaller value.

Looking at the differences between consecutive numbers: [5, 5, 3, 1, 1, 4, 3]. The smallest difference here is 1, which occurs twice. We can also notice that every other difference is either 1 or 3.

Since this sequence does not seem to follow a clear mathematical progression, it may be a list of unique numbers without any inherent pattern. It could represent data from different categories, such as ages, heights, or scores in various subjects. To find the hidden meaning behind this sequence, more context would be required.

Benefits accrue as of the first day after the Elimination Period and are paid monthly, but will not exceed the Maximum Duration of Benefits.

If a policyholder earns 20% or less of their Indexed Pre-disability Earnings after the Elimination Period, their Monthly Benefit is calculated by multiplying their Pre-disability Earnings by the Benefit Percentage. If they earn more than 20%, benefits will be determined for up to 12 consecutive months using a similar calculation and considering Other Income Benefits and Current Monthly Earnings.

If the policyholder's earnings are less than 80% of their Pre-disability Earnings during the Elimination Period or after, they may have an extended Elimination Period of up to 12 months. If their earnings exceed 80%, but they are unable to perform essential duties of their occupation, the Elimination Period will still be extended if their earnings remain above 80%.

Your benefit will not be payable if your current earnings after deducting family care credits exceed 80% of your pre-disability earnings.

If an employee returns to work full-time and experiences another disability, Unum will treat it as part of the prior disability. The plan provides coverage for disabilities when an employee is not working due to sickness or injury, subject to premium payment. If an employer changes insurance carriers to Unum, payments may be sent if the disability results from a pre-existing condition under certain conditions: the employee must have been in active employment and insured under the plan on its effective date and also insured by the prior policy at the time of change. The employee must satisfy the pre-existing condition provision under either the Unum plan or the prior carrier's plan to receive a payment.

The policy also defines terms such as Monthly Benefit, Monthly Earnings, Monthly Payment, Part-Time Basis, Payable Claim, and Physician. The Monthly Benefit is the total benefit amount for which an employee is insured under this plan, subject to a maximum benefit. Monthly Earnings refer to the gross monthly income from the Employer as defined in the plan. Monthly Payment is the employee's payment after deducting any sources of income. Part-Time Basis refers to the ability to work and earn between 20% and 80% of indexed monthly earnings. A Payable Claim is a claim for which Unum is liable under the terms of the policy, and a Physician is a medical doctor who provides healthcare services.

According to Unum Cert 4703669.pdf (pages [19]), upon proof of death, a lump sum benefit equal to 3 months of your gross disability payment will be paid to an eligible survivor if your disability lasted for at least 180 days and you were receiving or entitled to payments under the plan at the time of your death. If no eligible survivors exist, payment will be made to your estate, unless none exists; in such a case, no payment will be made but any overpayment on your claim will first be applied to the survivor benefit.

In cases where you are not actively employed when your employer switches insurance carriers to Unum, coverage is provided if you were not in active employment due to sickness or injury and covered by the prior policy. Coverage is subject to premium payment and limited to the amount that would have been paid by the prior carrier, with any liability of the prior carrier reducing your payment.

Similarly, for a disability resulting from a pre-existing condition upon switching to Unum, coverage may be provided if you were in active employment and insured under the plan on its effective date and insured by the prior policy at the time of change. To receive payments, you must satisfy the pre-existing condition provision either under the Unum plan or the prior carrier's plan had that policy remained in force. Failure to meet these requirements will result in no payments from Unum.

According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, mental illness payments will be extended beyond the initial 24 months under two conditions. First, if you are confined to a hospital or institution at the end of the 24-month period and remain so, Unum will provide ongoing payments throughout your stay, with an additional recovery period of up to 90 days following discharge. If subsequent reconfinement occurs within this period and lasts for at least 14 days straight, further payments are granted during that time and for another potential 90-day recovery period. Secondly, if you continue to be disabled after the 24-month payment period and subsequently get hospitalized for at least 14 consecutive days, Unum will provide payments throughout the duration of your reconfinement. However, payments will not exceed the limited pay period or the maximum payment term, whichever comes first. Furthermore, the mental illness limitation will not apply to dementia caused by stroke, trauma, viral infection, Alzheimer's disease, or other conditions not typically treated with psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or similar methods if they are managed by a different healthcare provider. Your plan does not cover disabilities resulting from, contributed to by, or caused by any conditions not listed in the document.

This Unum Cert 4703668.pdf policy outlines exclusions and conditions for disability coverage. Coverage does not extend to intentionally self-inflicted injuries, active participation in riots, loss of a professional license, commission of crimes, pre-existing conditions, or disabilities due to war or while incarcerated. A pre-existing condition is defined as receiving medical treatment, consultation, care or services, taking prescribed drugs, or having symptoms that warrant a healthcare provider's consultation within 3 months before the effective date of coverage, which can cause a disability within the first 12 months after coverage.

If an employee returns to work full-time and experiences another disability, it will be considered part of their prior disability. Upon changing insurance carriers to Unum, if an employee was in active employment and insured under the plan on its effective date, while also being insured by the prior policy at the time of change, they may receive payment for a disability due to a pre-existing condition as long as they satisfy the pre-existing condition provision either under the Unum or the prior carrier's plan.

The maximum period of payment is the longest duration Unum will make payments for any one disability. Mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety are covered, treated by mental health providers, and usually managed using psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or other similar methods. The monthly benefit indicates the total amount an employee is insured under this plan, subject to a maximum benefit. The monthly payment is calculated after deducting any sources of income. Working 20% or more of one's indexed monthly earnings on a part-time basis is considered working on a part-time basis. A payable claim is one for which Unum is liable under the terms of the policy. Lastly, a physician includes those licensed to practice medicine, with a doctoral degree in Psychology, or legally qualified medical practitioners according to the governing jurisdiction's laws and regulations.

According to Unum Cert 4703668.pdf, upon proof of death, a lump sum benefit is paid to eligible survivors if the insured's disability persisted for 180 days or more and they were receiving disability payments under the plan at the time of death. The benefit equals 3 months of the gross disability payment. If there are no eligible survivors, payment goes to the estate; otherwise, any overpayment will be deducted first.

If an insured is not in active employment when their employer switches insurance carriers to Unum, continuity of coverage applies if they were covered by the prior policy and are unable to work due to sickness or injury. The payment under this situation will match what the prior carrier would have paid, subject to premium payment and reduction for any liabilities of the prior carrier.

Similarly, if a disability results from a pre-existing condition upon switching insurance carriers to Unum, coverage is provided under specific conditions: the insured must have been in active employment and covered by the plan on its effective date and insured by the prior policy at the time of change. The payment will match what the prior carrier would have paid, subject to premium payment and reduction for any liabilities of the prior carrier. To receive a payment, the insured must satisfy the pre-existing condition provision under either the Unum plan or the prior carrier's plan. If not, no payments are made.
