According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages 10, eligible group employees are covered once the later of two dates is reached: either the policy's effective date or one day following their waiting period completion. This means that an employee must be working for the employer when the plan becomes active, and after fulfilling the waiting period, coverage begins. The specific dates vary based on the plan and individual circumstances.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, your coverage begins under specific conditions: if your employer fully covers the cost of your plan, you are insured at 12:01 a.m. on the date you become eligible for coverage. If you or your employer share the cost or pay the full amount yourself, coverage starts at 12:01 a.m., either on the date of eligibility if an application is submitted beforehand, within 31 days following eligibility, or when Unum approves your application if evidence of insurability is required. Evidence of insurability is mandatory for late applicants or those reapplying after voluntarily canceling coverage. You can obtain the necessary form from your employer. Eligibility dates and application deadlines are crucial in determining your insurance commencement.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, your insurance coverage begins when you return to active employment after an absence due to injury, sickness, temporary layoff, or leave of absence.

<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages 10, rows 1-3, if your employment is temporarily suspended (layoff), coverage under the policy persists through the month immediately following the month in which your layoff commences, given premium payments are maintained.

<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, any changes to your coverage take effect instantly if you're actively employed or on a covered layoff or leave of absence. If you're not working due to injury or sickness, the additional or increased coverage starts upon your return to active employment. Decreased coverage takes effect immediately and will not affect ongoing payments. Any adjustments in coverage commencement dates are based on these conditions.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, your insurance coverage terminates on the earliest of:

1. The policy or plan cancellation date.
2. Your departure from an eligible group.
3. The cessation of coverage for your eligible group.
4. The final day of any required contributions payment period.
5. The last day you are actively employed, unless stipulated under the covered layoff or leave of absence provision.

<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, legal action regarding your claim may commence 60 days after proof of claim is given and must be completed within 3 years from the later of when the initial proof of claim was required, your claim was denied, or benefits were terminated. This timeframe can be extended under federal law if specified.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, any statements made in a signed application for coverage are considered representations, not warranties. Incomplete or untrue statements can lead to claim reduction or denial, or coverage cancellation from the original effective date. The company will base decisions on these statements alone. If an employer provides incorrect information about you, they will use this data to decide your coverage and make a fair premium adjustment.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, effective from December 1st, 2015 (EMPLOYEE-3), the policy disables the waiver of the required disability insurance premium payment for Employee 123456 in the event of a physical or mental illness that prevents gainful employment, as long as such condition persists beyond 90 days. The disability benefit amount will be calculated based on the employee's salary and the policy provisions, with a maximum monthly payout of $3,000 and a minimum of $100. Any outstanding premium payments due prior to the qualifying disability date must be paid within 60 days from the receipt of the notice. Additionally, any changes in employment status or income must be reported promptly to Unum to ensure accurate benefit calculations.

The company is prepared to take all appropriate legal action against insurance fraud.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf (page 12, rows 1-2), the policy does not supersede or modify any obligations for workers' compensation or state disability insurance coverage requirements. In other words, your benefits under this policy will not replace potential entitlements from these programs. These requirements may vary based on jurisdiction and are subject to respective state laws.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, your employer acts as either its own agent or yours under the policy's terms. In no case will your employer be deemed as an agent of Unum. This clarification was made on December 1, 2015 (LTD-BEN-1).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf at pages 13, row 1, an individual is considered disabled if they are unable to perform the material and substantial duties of their own occupation due to a physical or mental health condition. The disability must prevent them from performing these duties on a full-time basis for a significant and continued period, typically lasting beyond the first 24 months. This definition may be subject to change as the policyholder's medical conditions improve or worsen. Additionally, Unum will consider the effects of pain, medication, and side effects of treatment when determining disability status.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages 13, row 1, 1, 1, and 2, disability benefits are provided if you experience a 20% or more decrease in indexed monthly earnings due to the same sickness or injury. After 24 months of payments, Unum determines your total and permanent disability, which means you're unable to perform any gainful occupation due to the same sickness or injury.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, a physician's regular care is necessary for disability consideration. Holding a revoked professional or occupational license or certification does not equate to being disabled.
<EOS>
This information from Unum Cert 5019931.pdf outlines the rules for Long Term Disability benefits reduction when deductible sources of income (Items 1, 2, and 3) are involved. If these benefits have not been awarded, denied, or are being appealed, a reduction in your payment may occur. However, this reduction will not apply if you: a) apply for the disability payments under said items and exhaust all necessary appeal levels; b) sign Unum's payment option form promising to repay any overpayment caused by an award.

An adjustment will be made when we receive proof of the awarded amount or confirmation that appeals have been completed and benefits denied. In such cases, a lump sum refund of the estimated amount will be given to you. If you receive a lump sum payment from these sources, it will be distributed monthly over a reasonable time period if no specific one is provided.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, if you become disabled while working, the days you are unable to work due to your disability will be counted towards satisfying your elimination period under the policy. This means that you may meet the elimination period requirement more quickly than if you were not working during your disability. It's important to note that this applies only to the period of time when you are both disabled and employed, as it is the combined days from these two periods that will count towards satisfying the elimination period. The exact number of days required for the elimination period will depend on the specific policy terms.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages 13, rows 1-3, payments for an approved claim will commence when the elimination period is met and you become disabled. Eligibility for these monthly payments continues as long as Unum is liable. The elimination period must be satisfied before payments can begin, ensuring that payments start after a specified duration, typically ranging from 30 to 180 days depending on the policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, your disability payment will be determined based on a few factors:

1. Your Monthly Basic Earnings (MBE): This is the average of your earnings before taxes for the calendar year prior to your Disability Effective Date.
2. The Maximum Benefit Percentage (MBP): For this policy, it's 60%.
3. The Maximum Monthly Benefit (MMB): To find this, multiply your MBE by the MBP. This amount cannot exceed $15,000 per month.
4. The Elimination Period (EP): This is the time between when you become disabled and when your benefits start. It's 30 days for most policies.
5. The Disability Effective Date: This is the date your disability began according to Unum's determination.
6. The End of Benefit Period: This depends on whether you have an Own Occupation or Any Occupation rider. For Own Occupation, benefits end when you no longer meet the definition of disabled in your own occupation; for Any Occupation, they end after 24 months or when you're able to work any occupation for which you're reasonably suited by education, training, or experience.
7. The Coordination of Benefits: If you have more than one policy with Unum, the total payments may be less than your combined Maximum Monthly Benefits due to this coordination rule.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, page 14 rows 1 and 2, the maximum monthly benefit for the LTD-BEN-2 policy effective from 12/1/2015 is set at $10,000. This coverage amount represents the maximum amount paid per month in case of disability and serves as the basis for calculating benefits under this policy.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on page 14, row 1, the monthly benefit you receive for a disability is either the specified maximum amount or your pre-disability earnings, whichever is lesser. In other words, your gross disability payment equals the smaller of these two amounts during the policy term.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages 14 (rows 1, 1, 1, 2, 3), your monthly disability payment (Item 4) may be reduced based on your earnings during disability. If you are disabled for less than a month, you will receive 1/30 of your monthly payment and additional benefits for each day of disability. The total amount paid daily is 1/30 of both the monthly payment and any additional benefits. This reduction in payment applies after the elimination period.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages 14, rows 1-5, the monthly total benefit you receive under this plan will not surpass 100% of your earnings, regardless of any other benefits. However, if enrolled in Unum's Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program, the monthly total benefit will not exceed 110% of your earnings.
<EOS>
According to the Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages 14 and subsequent rows 1-6, your "Monthly Earnings" refers to your annual gross income before taxes, deductions for qualified deferred compensation plans, Section 125 plans, or flexible spending accounts. This income can be sourced from the income box of your W-2 form for the year preceding your disability date, or, if no W-2 was issued, from your employment period. The calculation does not account for income derived from car, housing, moving allowances, Employer contributions to a qualified deferred compensation plan, or external sources. It's important to note that this figure does not include tips and other non-wage compensations reported on the W-2 form.
<EOS>
During a covered layoff or leave of absence, if you become disabled, your monthly earnings used for disability benefits will be based on those provided by your employer immediately before your absence commences, as stated in Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages [14], rows [1, 2, 3]. This means that the amount of financial assistance you receive during such a period is tied to your previous employment income.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, if you become disabled and continue working reduced hours, a monthly payment will be provided, subject to the following conditions:

- Your base salary at the time of disability must be less than 80% of your predisability earnings.
- The monthly payment is determined by taking 22% of your monthly earnings above 80% of your predisability earnings and capping it at 67% of your predisability earnings.
- Any pension or retirement income you receive will be deducted from the calculated monthly payment.
- If you are over 65 years old, a maximum benefit period of 24 months applies. For those under 65, the benefit period is up to age 65 or the return to work date, whichever comes first.
- The monthly payment will be adjusted annually based on changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages 14 and 15, under the Disability Earnings section (rows 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3), if your disability arises from the same sickness or injury, and your monthly disability earnings are between 20% and 80% of your indexed monthly earnings, Unum will calculate your payment as follows: during the initial 12 months while you're working, your payment won't be reduced if the combined disability earnings and gross disability payment don't surpass 100% of your indexed monthly earnings (as per LTD-BEN-3 dated 12/1/2015).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages 15 and specific rows 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, if the response from Item 1 is equal to or less than 100% of your indexed monthly earnings, no further reduction in monthly payments will occur. However, if it surpasses 100%, Unum deducts this excess from your payment. After 12 months of making payments while working, you become eligible for receipt of payments proportionate to the percentage of income lost due to disability.
<EOS>
This Unum Cert 5019931 policy detail on page 15, row 1 outlines the percentage of lost earnings for a claimant. To calculate this, one's monthly earnings prior to disability must be divided by the indexed monthly earnings specified in the policy. The resulting figure represents the percentage of lost earnings and is an essential aspect of determining benefits under this policy.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, the monthly payment amount is key for your benefits. During disability claims process, financial records such as income tax returns might be requested to verify earnings. Post the elimination period, if disabled for less than a month, you'll receive 1/30 of the payment per day.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, if your disability earnings are irregular month-to-month, the eligibility for benefits will be assessed based on the average of your income over the past three months. This policy ensures flexibility in determining benefits during times of fluctuating earnings, promoting financial security amidst unpredictable circumstances.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, pages 15, rows 1-2, your disability payment may be reduced by certain deductible sources of income. These include:

- Any disability benefits payable under a government program (e.g., Social Security Disability Insurance or Workers' Compensation) or any other group long-term disability policy.
- Self-employment income, if you are self-employed and have elected to receive business income replacement benefits under the policy.
- Any severance pay or supplemental unemployment benefit payments received from your employer.
- Any retirement benefits you may be entitled to under any plan sponsored by your employer.
- The net after-tax value of any life insurance, annuity, or endowment contract for which you are a beneficiary and/or owner.
- Any income received from rental properties that you own personally or through a partnership, LLC, or corporation, if the property was acquired during the benefit period.

These reductions apply to your gross disability payment and are based on the actual amount you receive in each category. The specific reduction percentage varies depending on the type of income source.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages 15, rows 1-3, the benefits you receive or are eligible for may be affected by various laws, including workers' compensation and occupational disease statutes, as well as any legislation with a similar intent. These laws may limit your payments or alter their duration based on provisions within these acts. The exact impact of these laws will depend on individual circumstances, such as the nature of the disability, the timing of the occurrence in relation to your employment, and the specific regulations governing each law. The percentages and duration of benefits may vary significantly depending on the legislative context, so it's essential to review relevant details in these areas of law if you have concerns about your entitlements.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages 15 and 16, the disability income you receive or are eligible for will not be reduced by disability retirement payments under any state compulsory benefit act or law, group plans sponsored by your employer, other group insurance plans, LTD-BEN-4 (12/1/2015), or governmental retirement systems. However, it's important to note that these exemptions do not apply if the total amount received from all sources exceeds 80% of your pre-disability earnings.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, if you become disabled, your disability payments may be influenced by social security benefits received from the United States Social Security Act, the Canada Pension Plan, and the Quebec Pension Plan, or any similar plan or act. The amount of these concurrent payments will depend on factors such as your age, earnings, and eligibility criteria under each respective plan's regulations. These plans may provide partial or total replacement of income during disability, up to a maximum percentage set by each program.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, sections [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4] on page 16, retirement payments received by you or your children may be reduced if you're concurrently receiving retirement benefits under the United States Social Security Act, Canada Pension Plan, Quebec Pension Plan, or any similar plans/acts. These reductions apply to the total amount of retirement income from this policy and the specified sources. The extent of reduction depends on the specific terms of each plan/act and is subject to adjustments based on the applicable laws.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, retirement payments received do not include those initiated at age 62 or the normal retirement age under your employer's plan if they stem from post-tax contributions. The policy considers all such payments as distributed across your lifetime. Rolled-over or transferred amounts are excluded. Unum adheres to the Internal Revenue Code Section 402 definition of an eligible retirement plan, which may be amended in future. Retirement payments under any governmental system are not included within post-tax contributions.
<EOS>
This information from Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages [16, 17] outlines key aspects regarding disability and retirement payments under an employer's plan. Disability payments are those benefits paid due to disability that do not reduce the retirement benefit if not for the disability. Retirement payments are based on your employer's contributions to the plan.

Disability benefits that reduce the retirement benefit will also be considered as a retirement benefit. Simultaneous distribution of retirement funds and contributions throughout your lifetime is assumed by Unum. Rolled-over or transferred amounts are not included in received amounts, following the definition of an eligible retirement plan under Section 402 of the Internal Revenue Code, including any future amendments.

These disability or retirement payments will be distributed when you reach either age 62 or the normal retirement age as defined by your employer's plan. LTD-BEN-5 (12/1/2015) 15 applies to these arrangements.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Cert 5019931.pdf (page 17, rows 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3), the payment you receive under Title 46, United States Code Section 688 will only be reduced by deductible income sources related to the same disability. In contrast, your Social Security retirement income will not be considered a reduction factor if your disability commences post-age 65 and you were already receiving such benefits prior. Exceptions apply to retirement payments.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, several income sources are not subject to deduction from your disability payment. These include, but are not limited to: 401(k) plans, profit sharing plans, thrift plans, tax sheltered annuities, stock ownership plans, non-qualified deferred compensation plans, pension plans for partners, military pensions and disability income, credit disability insurance, franchise disability income plans, retirement plans from another employer, individual retirement accounts (IRA), individual disability income plans, no fault motor vehicle plans, salary continuation or accumulated sick leave plans.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages 17 rows [1, 1, 2, 1], the minimum monthly disability payment is either $100 or 10% of your gross disability benefit. The larger figure applies. Unum has the right to use this amount towards any outstanding overpayments.
<EOS>
In accordance with Unum Cert 5019931.pdf (rows [1, 2, 3, 1, 2] on pages [17, 18]), once a deductible source of income has been subtracted from your gross disability payment, any subsequent cost-of-living increases from that same source will not further reduce your payment. This policy update took effect on December 1, 2015 (LTD-BEN-6).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages [18, 19], monthly payments will be sent until the maximum period of payment based on your age at disability. If you're under 62 or Social Security Normal Retirement Age (SSNRA), payments continue up to SSNRA age. For those aged 62, payments last 60 months; 63, 48 months; 64, 42 months; 65, 36 months; 66, 30 months; 67, 24 months; 68, 18 months; and 69 or older, 12 months. The Social Security Normal Retirement Age varies from 65 years (1937-1954), 65 years 2-6 months (1938-1942), 65 years 8-10 months (1943-1959), to 67 years (1960 and after).

2. After 24 months, if you can work part-time in any gainful occupation and do not.
3. If your monthly disability earnings exceed 80% of indexed monthly earnings at a specific point.
4. At the end of the maximum payment period.
5. If you are no longer disabled under the plan terms, unless eligible for Unum's Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program.
6. If proof of continuing disability is not provided after 12 months of payments if residing outside the United States or Canada (you will be considered outside these countries after being absent for a total of 6 months or more during any 12 consecutive months of benefits).
7. Upon your death.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, section on page 19 row 1, certain disabilities under this plan have a limited pay period. The lifetime cumulative maximum benefit for all mental and nervous system disorders is $120,000 at 60% of the pre-disability earnings, with a 24-month limitation from the onset date. After reaching the $120,000 limit, benefits will no longer be payable. Additionally, if an employee returns to work on a part-time basis and their earnings exceed the pre-disability level, their disability benefits will be reduced proportionately.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf (page 19, rows 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2), benefits for illnesses and disabilities primarily based on self-reported symptoms will only be paid for a maximum of 24 months, regardless of whether the disabilities are continuous or unrelated. Payments beyond this period may be sent if you fulfill specific conditions. The policy, however, stipulates that benefits will not exceed 24 months, combined, for all such disabilities.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages 19 and 20, if you are hospitalized or institutionalized at the end of the 24-month period, they will continue sending payments during your confinement. If disabled upon discharge, Unum will provide additional payments for a 90-day recovery period. If reconfined within this recovery period for at least 14 days consecutively, further payments will be made during that time, along with an additional 90-day recovery period. This cycle can repeat once more if you are again reconfined during the second recovery period. These provisions apply from December 1, 2015 (LDT-BEN-8).
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, if you are not hospitalized but confined for at least 14 days within the first 90 days after a 24-month payment period, payments will continue during your confinement. However, payments will cease beyond the maximum specified in the BENEFITS AT A GLANCE section of your policy. Unum does not apply the mental illness limitation to dementia caused by stroke, trauma, viral infection, Alzheimer's disease, or other conditions not typically treated with psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, or similar methods, as stated in this document.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, your policy does not cover disabilities caused by self-inflicted injuries, active participation in a riot, loss of professional or occupational licenses/certifications, committing a crime for which you have been convicted, or pre-existing conditions. The policy also excludes coverage due to war, acts of war, and any period of disability during incarceration.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, a pre-existing condition is defined as receiving medical treatment, consultation, care or services, including diagnostic measures, or taking prescribed drugs or medicines within the three months preceding your policy's effective date, and if your disability begins during the first 12 months following this effective date.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, if your disability recurs within 6 months after the end of a prior claim (as per LTD-BEN-9 dated 12/1/2015), you may not need to complete another elimination period provided that coverage was continuous under the plan from the end of the previous claim to the recurrent disability. The recurrent disability will be subject to the same terms as your prior claim and treated as a continuation, but any disability beyond 6 months from the end of the prior claim will be considered a new claim, subject to all policy provisions including the elimination period. If you become entitled to payments under any other group long-term disability plan, you will not receive payments under this Unum plan (LTD-OTR-1 dated 12/1/2015).
<EOS>
This information from Unum Cert 5019931.pdf outlines the Survivor Benefit terms on page [22]. If deceased, eligible survivors receive a lump sum equal to 3 months of the gross disability payment, provided the disability lasted 180 days and payments were being made under the plan. The benefit goes to the estate if there are no survivors, but overpayments take precedence. A terminally ill policyholder may receive this 3-month lump sum before death, contingent on a written election and a physician's certification of a terminal illness with less than a 12-month life expectancy. This benefit is available once, and if exercised prior to death, no subsequent 3-month survivor benefit will be paid.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages 22 and 23 under the Continuity of Coverage section, your insurance coverage is applicable if you are out of active employment due to sickness or injury, and were previously insured by another carrier. Your coverage is contingent upon premium payment, limited to the amount that would have been paid by the prior carrier. Unum will adjust your payment by any liability amount owed to the previous carrier. This policy applies from the effective date and follows the LTD-OTR-2 guidelines from December 1, 2015.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, page numbers [23] rows [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1], disability payments due to a pre-existing condition are possible if you were employed actively and insured under the plan on its effective date, and had prior policy coverage at the time of change. To receive payment, you must meet the pre-existing condition provision either in the Unum or prior carrier's plan.

If you satisfy both requirements, payments will adhere to the Unum plan provisions, with your benefit being the lesser of the monthly benefit under the prior or current plan. Payments end upon the earlier date: either the maximum benefit period's end under the plan or the date benefits would have ended under the prior plan had it remained active.
<EOS>
This information from Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages [23, 24] outlines their Vocational Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program.

According to the Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on page 24, a supplementary disability benefit of 10% (up to $1,000 monthly) is offered when on disability, not subject to policy adjustments due to Deductible Sources of Income but liable to the Total Benefit Cap. This extra payment continues for three months following the end of your disability if you are simultaneously enrolled in their Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program and unable to secure employment during that period. This benefit can be paid as a lump sum.
<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf on pages 24 (rows 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1), the Rehabilitation and Return to Work Assistance program benefits will cease on the earliest of two dates: firstly, when Unum decides you no longer meet eligibility criteria for the program; secondly, any date where monthly payments under this plan would terminate.

<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, page 26, rows 1-2, additional services are offered under your Unum Long Term Disability plan. These include vocational rehabilitation and case management.

<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, the Indexed Monthly Earnings refer to your earnings adjusted annually by the lesser of 10% or the current percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U). This indexing ensures your earnings' growth but prevents their decrease.

<EOS>
According to Unum Cert 5019931.pdf, page 29 row 2, the Maximum Period of Payment refers to the longest duration for which payments will be made to you during any one period of disability. The exact length varies based on your specific policy, but it is crucial to note that Unum will only make these payments for a defined maximum period, and this period may differ from other insurance providers or policies.
