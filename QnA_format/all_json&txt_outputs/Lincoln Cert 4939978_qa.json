The Company will determine the Insured Employee's eligibility and the amount of any Benefit payable. ELIGIBILITY.  An Insured Employee may be eligible for this Benefit, if the Company finds that he or she: 1. has a Disability that prevents the performance of his or her regular occupation; and, after the Own Occupation Period, also lacks the skills, training or experience needed to perform any other gainful occupation; 2. has the physical and mental abilities needed to complete a Program; and 3. is reasonably expected to return to work after completing the Program; in view of his or her degree of motivation and the labor force demand for workers in the proposed occupation. The Company must also find that the cost of the proposed services is less than its expected claim liability. AMOUNT.  The amount of any Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit will not exceed the Company's expected claims liability.  This benefit will not be payable for services covered under the Insured Employee's health care plan or any other vocational rehabilitation program.

This Benefit consists of services which may include: 1. vocational evaluation, counseling, training or job placement; 2. job modification or special equipment; and 3. other services which the Company deems reasonably necessary to help the Insured Employee return to work. The Company will determine the Insured Employee's eligibility and the amount of any Benefit payable. ELIGIBILITY.  An Insured Employee may be eligible for this Benefit, if the Company finds that he or she: 1. has a Disability that prevents the performance of his or her regular occupation; and, after the Own Occupation Period, also lacks the skills, training or experience needed to perform any other gainful occupation; 2. has the physical and mental abilities needed to complete a Program; and 3. is reasonably expected to return to work after completing the Program; in view of his or her degree of motivation and the labor force demand for workers in the proposed occupation.
