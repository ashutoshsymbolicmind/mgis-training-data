It is essential to note that any diagnosis, treatment, or consultation related to the Pre-Existing Condition received within this 12-month period will not be covered under the policy during this timeframe (pages 26, 27).\n\n   Lastly, treatment for a Pre-Existing Condition that does not meet the definition of a qualifying disability after the first two years may still be covered if it results in a complication or recurrence of the original condition and meets the requirements of a qualifying disability (page 32). The policy defines \"Treatment\" as consultation, care, or services provided by a Physician.
