The same Maximum Benefit Period, Exclusions, and Limitations will apply to the Recurrent Disability as to the prior Disability.  The Predisability Income used in determining the prior Disability benefit will apply as well.

It outlines the rules for Recurrent Disability benefits, which are treated differently based on whether a new Disability begins or the Recurrent Disability is part of the prior Disability.\n\nIf a new Disability starts, the Insured Employee or former Employee must earn less than the specified percentage of Predisability Income to qualify for a Monthly Benefit. The amount will be subject to all terms of the Policy applicable at the time the prior Disability began. However, this Recurrent Disability provision ceases to apply if the Insured Employee or former Employee becomes eligible for coverage under any other group long-term disability plan.\n\nIf the Recurrent Disability is part of the prior Disability, the Predisability Income used in determining the prior Disability benefit will apply. The benefits reinstated under this provision are subject to the Policy's terms and conditions at the time the prior Disability began. To qualify for a Monthly Benefit, the Insured Employee or former Employee must still earn less than the specified percentage of Predisability Income."

For example, if benefits may be payable under the federal Social Security Act, the Insured Employee: 1. must apply for such benefits on a timely basis; 2. must file a request for reconsideration, if benefits are denied; and 3. must request a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge, if denied again (unless the Company waives this in writing). An Employer whose Insured Employee may be entitled to Workers' Compensation or similar benefits is also required to cooperate in filing that claim.  If the Insured Employee fails to pursue Other Income Benefits on a timely basis, the Company has the option to: 1. deny or suspend Monthly Benefits; or 2. reduce Monthly Benefits by an estimated amount. Estimating Offsets .    While a claim for Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits is pending, the Insured Employee must elect one of the following options in writing.  (If no written election is made, Monthly Benefits will be reduced in accord with Option 1.) 1. Reduced Monthly Benefits .  The Insured Employee may receive Monthly Benefits reduced by estimated Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits.  The Company will adjust Policy benefits and will refund any underpayment, in a lump sum, upon receiving proof of: a. the amount actually awarded; or b. the claim denial and completion of any appeal the Company requires. 2. Unreduced Monthly Benefits .  The Insured Employee may receive unreduced Monthly Benefits while the claim is pending.  He or she must agree in writing to promptly refund any overpayment that results, in a lump sum, upon receiving Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits.  If he or she does not promptly refund an overpayment: a. the Company will reduce or eliminate future payments; and b. the Minimum Monthly Benefit will not apply, until the amount is repaid. Lump Sum Payments .  Other Income Benefits that are paid in a lump sum will be pro rated as follows. 1. The lump sum will be pro rated on a monthly basis, over the time period for which it is given. 2. If no time period is stated, the Company will continue its estimated monthly offset for that benefit, until full amount is offset. 3. If no estimated monthly offset was being made for that benefit, the lump sum will be pro rated on a monthly basis over a reasonable time period.   It will not exceed 60 months or the Maximum Benefit Period (whichever occurs first) . Cost-of-Living Freeze.
