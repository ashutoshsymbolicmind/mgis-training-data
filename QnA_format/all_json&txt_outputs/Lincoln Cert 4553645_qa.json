        "content": "DEFINITIONS (continued) RETIREMENT BENEFIT , when used with the term Retirement Plan, means a benefit that: 1. is payable under a Retirement Plan either in a lump sum or in the form of periodic payments; 2. does not represent contributions made by an Insured Employee (Payments representing Employee contributions are deemed to be received over the Insured Employee's expected remaining life, regardless of when they are actually received.); and 3. is payable upon: a. early or normal retirement; or b. disability (if the payment does reduce the benefit which would have been paid at the normal retirement age under the plan, if disability had not occurred). RETIREMENT PLAN  means a defined benefit or defined contribution plan that: 1. provides Retirement Benefits to Employees; and 2. is not funded wholly by Employee contributions. The term shall  not  include any 401(k), profit-sharing or thrift plan; informal salary continuance plan; individual retirement account (IRA); tax sheltered annuity (TSA); stock ownership plan; or a non-qualified plan of deferred compensation. An Employer's Retirement Plan is deemed to include any Retirement Plan: 1. which is part of any federal, state, county, municipal or association retirement system; and 2. for which the Insured Employee is eligible as a result of employment with the Employer. SICK LEAVE  or  SALARY CONTINUANCE PLAN  means a plan that: 1. is established and maintained by the Employer for the benefit of Employees; and 2. continues payment of all or part of an Insured Employee's Predisability Income for a specified period after he or she becomes Disabled. It does  not  include compensation the Employer pays an Insured Employee for work actually performed during a Disability. SICKNESS  means illness, pregnancy or disease. TOTAL COVERED PAYROLL  means the total amount of Basic Monthly Earnings for all Employees insured under the Policy. TOTAL DISABILITY or TOTALLY DISABLED  will be defined as follows. 1. During the Elimination Period and Own Occupation Period, it means that due to an Injury or Sickness the Insured Employee is unable to perform each of the Main Duties of his or her Own Occupation. 2. After the Own Occupation Period, it means that due to an Injury or Sickness the Insured Employee is unable to perform each of the Main Duties of any occupation which his or her training, education or experience will reasonably allow. The loss of a professional license, an occupational license or certification, or a driver's license for any reason does  not , by itself, constitute Total Disability. WAITING PERIOD  means the period of time an Employee must be employed in an eligible class with the Employer, before he or she becomes eligible to enroll for coverage under the Policy.  The period of service must be continuous, except as explained in the Eligibility provision captioned Prior Service Credit Towards Waiting Period.",

If the Insured Employee may be entitled to Other Income Benefits that affect Policy benefits, the following rules will apply. Claiming Other Income Benefits.   An   Insured Employee who may be entitled to some Other Income Benefit is required to actively pursue it.  For example, if benefits may be payable under the federal Social Security Act, the Insured Employee: 1. must apply for such benefits on a timely basis; 2. must file a request for reconsideration, if benefits are denied; and 3. must request a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge, if denied again (unless the Company waives this in writing). An Employer whose Insured Employee may be entitled to Workers' Compensation or similar benefits is also required to cooperate in filing that claim.  If the Insured Employee fails to pursue Other Income Benefits on a timely basis, the Company has the option to: 1. deny or suspend Monthly Benefits; or 2. reduce Monthly Benefits by an estimated amount. Estimating Offsets .    While a claim for Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits is pending, the Insured Employee must elect one of the following options in writing.  (If no written election is made, Monthly Benefits will be reduced in accord with Option 1.) 1. Reduced Monthly Benefits .  The Insured Employee may receive Monthly Benefits reduced by estimated Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits.  The Company will adjust Policy benefits and will refund any underpayment, in a lump sum, upon receiving proof of: a. the amount actually awarded; or b. the claim denial and completion of any appeal the Company requires. 2. Unreduced Monthly Benefits .  The Insured Employee may receive unreduced Monthly Benefits while the claim is pending.  He or she must agree in writing to promptly refund any overpayment that results, in a lump sum, upon receiving Social Security or other Government Retirement Plan benefits.  If he or she does not promptly refund an overpayment: a. the Company will reduce or eliminate future payments; and b. the Minimum Monthly Benefit will not apply, until the amount is repaid. Lump Sum Payments .  Other Income Benefits that are paid in a lump sum will be pro rated as follows. 1. The lump sum will be pro rated on a monthly basis, over the time period for which it is given. 2. If no time period is stated, the Company will continue its estimated monthly offset for that benefit, until full amount is offset. 3. If no estimated monthly offset was being made for that benefit, the lump sum will be pro rated on a monthly basis over a reasonable time period.   It will not exceed 60 months or the Maximum Benefit Period (whichever occurs first) . Cost-of-Living Freeze.   After the first deduction for each of the Other Income Benefits (except Earnings), its amount will be frozen.  The Monthly Benefit will not be further reduced due to any cost-of-living increases payable under these Other Income Benefits.",

If an Insured Employee is Disabled and is receiving Policy benefits; then he or she may be eligible for a Vocational Rehabilitation Benefit.  This Benefit consists of services which may include: 1. vocational evaluation, counseling, training or job placement; 2. job modification or special equipment; and 3. other services which the Company deems reasonably necessary to help the Insured Employee return to work. The Company will determine the Insured Employee's eligibility and the amount of any Benefit payable. ELIGIBILITY.  An Insured Employee may be eligible for this Benefit, if the Company finds that he or she: 1. has a Disability that prevents the performance of his or her regular occupation; and, after the Own Occupation Period, also lacks the skills, training or experience needed to perform any other gainful occupation; 2. has the physical and mental abilities needed to complete a Program; and 3. is reasonably expected to return to work after completing the Program; in view of his or her degree of motivation and the labor force demand for workers in the proposed occupation.

Any Survivor Benefit will be payable in accord with that section. 2. Any other benefits will be payable to the Insured Employee's estate. If a benefit becomes payable to: 1. the Insured Employee's estate; or 2. a minor or any other person who is not legally competent to give a valid receipt; then up to $2,000 may be paid to any relative of the Insured Employee that the Company finds entitled to payment.  If payment is made in good faith to such a relative, the Company will not have to pay that benefit again. NOTICE OF CLAIM DECISION.   The Company will send the Insured Employee a written notice of its claim decision.  If the Company denies any part of the claim, the written notice will explain: 1. the reason for the denial, under the terms of the Policy and any internal guidelines; 2. how the Insured Employee may request a review of the Company's decision; and 3. whether more information is needed to support the claim. It will include the claim number and name, address and phone number of the Company's claim service office. This notice will be sent within 15 days after the Company resolves the claim.  It will be sent within 45 days after the Company receives the first proof of claim, if reasonably possible. Delay Notice.   The Company may need more than 15 days to process the claim, due to matters beyond its control.  If so, an extension will be permitted.  In that event, the Company will send the Insured Employee a written delay notice: 1. by the 15 th  day after receiving the first proof of claim; and 2. every 30 days after that, until the claim is resolved. The notice will explain: 1. what additional information is needed to determine liability; and 2. when a decision can be expected. If the Insured Employee does not receive a written decision by the 105 th  day after the Company receives the first proof of claim, or within 60 days after the Company receives complete proof of claim; there is a right to an immediate review, as if the claim was denied. Exception:   The Company may need more information from the Insured Employee to process a claim.  If so, it must be supplied within 45 days after the Company requests it.  The resulting delay will not count towards the above time limits for claim processing. REVIEW PROCEDURE.   Within 180 days after receiving a denial notice, the Insured Employee may request a claim review by sending the Company: 1. a written request; and 2. any written comments or other items to support the claim. The Insured Employee may review certain non-privileged information relating to the request for review. The Company will review the claim and send the Insured Employee a written notice of its decision.  The notice will state the reasons for the Company's decision, under the terms of the Policy and any internal guidelines.  If the Company upholds the denial of all or part of the claim, the notice will also describe: 1. any further appeal procedures available under the Policy; 2. the right to access relevant claim information; and 3. the right to request a state insurance department review, or to bring legal action. This notice will be sent within 45 days after the Company receives the request for review, or within 90 days if a special case requires more time.",
