This information is derived primarily from Unum Policy 5355035 (1), spread across various pages [1, 4, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 21, 22, 24, 25, 28, 34, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 49]. It outlines key details regarding eligibility for Short-Term Disability (STD) benefits under this policy. Eligible employees can receive up to 60% of their pre-disability earnings for a maximum duration of 26 weeks.

   The policy covers disability due to illness or injury that prevents the employee from performing the material duties of their own occupation. To qualify, the disability must persist beyond a 14-day waiting period and be certified by a healthcare provider. The policy also mentions the possibility of extending STD benefits for an additional 26 weeks if the employee exhausts their Long-Term Disability (LTD) coverage up to the employer-insurer becomes insolvent or withdraws from the group policy under which they are covered employees will continue to pay STD and LTD benefits.

   The policy also specifies that if an employee terminates employment for any reason other than disability, their eligibility for STD benefits ceases at such termination of employment. However, the employee may continue to receive LTD benefits under this group coverage or insurance purchased individually.
