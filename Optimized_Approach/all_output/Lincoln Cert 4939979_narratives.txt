According to the document Lincoln Cert 4939979, partial disability or part-time incapacity is defined as follows: During the Elimination Period and Own Occupation Period, it refers to an injury or sickness that prevents the insured employee from performing one or more main duties of their regular occupation, or prevents them from doing such duties full-time, while they are engaged in Partial Disability Employment. After the Own Occupation Period, it means an injury or sickness that hinders the employee from performing one or more essential functions of their regular occupation, regardless of whether they perform these duties on a part-time basis or not.

The document also outlines specific definitions for full-time and Partially Disabled work. Full-time is defined as the average number of hours an insured employee was regularly scheduled to work at their regular occupation during the month prior to either: 1) the start date of the Elimination Period, or 2) the commencement of an approved leave of absence, if the Elimination Period starts while the employee is continuing coverage during a leave.

The document mentions several criteria that dictate when partial disability benefits can cease. These include:
- The insured employee earning more than 99% of their predisability income before partial disability benefits have been paid for 24 months for the same period of disability, or 85% after 24 months.
- The insured employee being able to work full-time in their regular occupation, regardless of whether they are earning the same wage as prior to their disability.
- The insured employee being found fit to return to any gainful occupation for which they are reasonably suited by education, training, or experience.

The document provides information on various benefits and requirements related to partial disability, including extended period of disability benefits and vocational rehabilitation services, among others. The exact extent of these benefits may depend on the specific circumstances of each individual case, as outlined in the documentation provided.
<EOS>
Under this policy, as outlined in Lincoln Cert 4939979.pdf, there is a provision for Vocational Rehabilitation Benefits (VRB). This benefit can be accessed when an Insured Employee is disabled and receiving policy benefits, provided they meet eligibility criteria. The VRB includes vocational evaluation, counseling, training, job placement, job modification, special equipment, and other necessary services to help the employee return to work.

Eligibility for this benefit is determined by the Company if the Insured Employee:
  1. Has a disability that prevents performance of their regular occupation, lacks skills/training/experience for any other gainful occupation after the Own Occupation Period, and has the physical and mental abilities needed to complete a vocational rehabilitation program.
  2. Is reasonably expected to return to work post-program completion given their degree of motivation and the labor force demand for workers in the proposed occupation.
  3. The cost of the proposed services is less than the Company's expected claim liability.

The amount of any VRB payable will not exceed the Company's expected claims liability, with payments made to service providers at the Company's discretion. Proposals for vocational rehabilitation can come from either the Company, the Insured Employee, or their Physician. During the rehabilitation period, the Policy's definition of "Disability" is waived, but it remains crucial in other aspects.
